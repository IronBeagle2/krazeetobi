<br>Hi, I'm KrazeeTobi. I'm 18 and I live somewhere that any American would call the home of taxes, tea, chips, whatever. Yes, it's the UK, specifically England. I've been into Sonic since I was probably about 5 or 6? I don't recall. I had a GBA with Sonic Advance 3 if that says anything about how old I am. Anyway, I've also been a fan of DOOM since ~2016, and very recently become a fan of Bluey, approximately around November 17th, 2021. I've also been active on Roblox and Minecraft since December 2011 and May 2012 respectively. <!--Hey, you, yeah, you! You're peeking into the code! Well, for your hard work, here's the story of how I got into Bluey. I was over at my sister's because my of my father's early-stage dementia, so he went to a class for about four weeks. This was during the third week. The first episode I watched was almost certainly "Doctor".--></br></br></br></p>
