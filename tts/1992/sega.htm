<H3>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</H3>
<P>After being shown at the Summer Consumer Electronic Show this year, Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was shown over in Japan. The game looks brilliant, but sorta feels like the first Sonic all over again with a grassy area with some waterfalls. The game also sounds exactly like the first game, though we're to expect that to be ironed out before release.</P>
<P>Sonic also has a new friend, whose name is Miles "Tails" Prower, though we didn't see him in the demo we played. Say what you will, but I think this may turn out to be an excellent game.</P>
