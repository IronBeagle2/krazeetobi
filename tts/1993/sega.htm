<P>He's back. After several great games. We can expect Sega to deliver with this next-generation Sonic title. The game is slated to be 70 levels long (holy moly!). What levels we saw included one that looks similar to first game's Green Hill zone, another looks Vegas-y, and another looks like the Labyrinth zone, again from the first game.</P>
<P>Like last year's show, Sonic has another new friend...or rather, GIRLfriend. Her name is "Emmy". Sonic can also travel time to thwart the doings of Dr. Robotnik, though he'll have to go through some revolving special stages!</P>
