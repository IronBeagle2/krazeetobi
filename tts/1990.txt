THE TOKYO TOY SHOW OF 1990

Held at Makuhari Messe from June 7th-10th. The first two days were business days.

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Mega Anser (Mega Answer)


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Advanced Daisenryaku: Deutsch Dengeki Sakusen (Advanced Strategy: German Blitzkrieg Tactics)


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Battle Golfer Yui (Sole Battle Golfer)
While it has a sports-sounding name, it isn't actually a normal sports game. This is an RPG. You are exploring a golf course, gathering details from golfing pros, caddies, and workers.

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SUNSOFT / Batman
The Caped Crusader is now on Mega Drive! Everything across the board is really good. Of course, the Joker is back for more pranks and jokes. Come on, let's save Vicki!

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Bonanza Bros.


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / NAMCO / Burning Force


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / ASMIK / Cutie Suzuki no Ringside Angel


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Daisenpuu (Twin Hawk)
We are now departing to... World War 2. You are the pilot of a plane on several bombing missions. The standard power-ups are here, along with a special new one... calling for reinforcement! Yes, that's right. You can call for an additional six planes to assist you.

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / WOLF TEAM / FZ Senki Axis (Final Zone)


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / GAME ARTS / Gambler Jiko Chuushinha: Katayama Masayuki no Mahjong Doujou


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / NAMCO / Phelios


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SIGMA / Psy-O-Blade


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / TAITO / Rainbow Islands Extra
Geared more for the younger players, you have to jump upward from ledge to ledge, similar to Nintendo's Donkey Kong. Avoid or trap the bugs that are after you, and don't forget to grab some food!

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / TAITO / Rastan Saga II


SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Shadow Dancer: The Secret of Shinobi
We've seen this in the arcades -- but for those who haven't seen it before; this is the true sequel to Shinobi, filled with an all-new challenge, better graphics, as well as gameplay. The assassin's got a pet dog too!

SEGA MEGA DRIVE / SEGA / Sonic the Hedgehog
An unusual game, in which you control a blue hedgehog known as "Sonic". You're on a mission to defeat evil, as most games go. From what we saw, the game has a buff baddie who's also blue. The game looks quite fun and impressive. No sound, though, and it seems like it was a tape that was replaying over and over.
