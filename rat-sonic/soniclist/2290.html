<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following evening, there were four Knothole freedom
<br />
fighters waiting for Spartacus.  Sonic and Sally were joined by
<br />
Bunnie and Antoine.  Sally thought that the badger clan might not
<br />
appreciate what would happen if they were to let Robotnik
<br />
continue unchecked.  So Bunnie was along as sort of a visual aid.
<br />
Antoine, who had shared Sally's apprehension that the badgers
<br />
would continue to keep the old grudge alive and might attempt to
<br />
harm Sally if they learned she was of the House of Acorn,
<br />
insisted on going along to protect Sally.  Sally finally relented
<br />
(over Sonic's strenuous objections).  This was actually a second
<br />
reason why Bunnie was coming along: to keep an eye on Antoine as
<br />
he kept an eye on Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the appointed time, Spartacus stepped noiselessly into
<br />
the clearing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ooo-wee!&quot; Bunnie whispered.  &quot;Sally-girl, you weren't half-
<br />
kiddin' about them badgers!  Ah hope they got a few more like
<br />
this one!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He DID say he has a brother.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You've brought quite a few friends, Sonic,&quot; Spartacus
<br />
observed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well, we're kind of a team.  You've met Sal and
<br />
Antoine; this is Bunnie.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus shook her hand and stared at her for a few
<br />
seconds.  &quot;I don't understand; where's the rest of your armor?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This ain't armor, sugar.  This is little ol' me after
<br />
Robotnik got his hands on me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We were able to save Bunnie, but not before Robotnik did
<br />
his share of damage.  I'm hoping to convince the elders of the
<br />
clan that they can avert this danger.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus considered Bunnie for a few more seconds.  &quot;It may
<br />
be difficult; some badgers would consider this an improvement.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not what you think.  How can I put this so you'll
<br />
understand?  When a creature is roboticized, they're given a
<br />
warrior's body but they're robbed of a warrior's heart.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is this true?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  Once you're roboticized, you no longer have a will of
<br />
your own; you can only carry out the bidding of Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That IS a consideration.  As long as you put it in those
<br />
terms, there may be a chance the elders will listen to you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way to go, Sal!&quot; Sonic whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks, but we haven't made our case yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked on through the Great Forest, with Spartacus
<br />
leading the way.  Though the light was beginning to fail, the
<br />
Knothole Freedom Fighters instantly recognized a small clearing
<br />
they passed through several minutes later.  Spartacus said
<br />
nothing about it, but the others knew that they had just crossed
<br />
a seldom-used trail that was a shortcut back to Knothole.  They
<br />
kept it in mind for future reference.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just as the sun was setting that they heard sounds up
<br />
ahead: deep and gruff voices speaking a strange tongue, the high-
<br />
pitched cries and shouts of small children, and someone telling a
<br />
cadenced story to the accompaniment of a simple skin drum.  They
<br />
knew from the way Spartacus lengthened his stride that they were
<br />
nearing his home.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badger settlement was a seemingly haphazard array of
<br />
stick-and-mud lodges built so that their doorways faced a central
<br />
clearing.  Small cooking fires burned in front of many of them,
<br />
boiling the contents of iron pots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Spartacus entered the clearing, conversation dimmed and
<br />
all eyes turned on his guests.  The Knothole Freedom Fighters
<br />
didn't exactly feel welcome as the badgers silently scrutinized
<br />
them.  Sally saw one small boy, a mere toddler, holding tightly
<br />
to one of his mother's leg with one hand while in the other hand
<br />
he brandished a wooden spoon as if it were a sword.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not exactly the red carpet treatment, is it?&quot; Sally
<br />
whispered to Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mood changed appreciably as they were directed to
<br />
Spartacus' hut.  Outside, bent over a fire, was an elderly female
<br />
badger who gave the travellers the first kind look they'd
<br />
received so far.  Forgetting about the contents of the pot, she
<br />
walked up to them and took Sonic's hands in one of her own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So your old friend has grown up, my son.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Mother.  This is my mother, Diana.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I remember you from when you were in Mobotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was too many sunsets ago, I'm afraid,&quot; she chuckled. 
<br />
&quot;But let's get your friends something to eat.  Adonis!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of the hut stepped the impossible: a badger even larger
<br />
and more powerful-looking than Spartacus.  &quot;Adonis, your
<br />
brother's friends are here.  Fetch bowls for them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Mother, I was on my way to target practice.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can hurl axes with your friends after you've showed our
<br />
guests some common courtesy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They're not MY guests,&quot; he muttered as he retreated back
<br />
into the lodge.  He emerged a few seconds later with a stack of
<br />
carved wooden bowls.  Diana began ladling a thick stew into them
<br />
and passing them to the Freedom Fighters.  Sally noticed that
<br />
there weren't any spoons or forks being passed around; a quick
<br />
glance at some other families taking their evening meal confirmed
<br />
her suspicion, and she began to scoop the contents out of the
<br />
bowl with her hand, bringing it to her mouth.  The others
<br />
followed suit, the fastidious Antoine with the greatest
<br />
reluctance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is very good, Diana,&quot; Sally said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, child.  And you may call me 'Mother' if it
<br />
pleases you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a common way of showing respect,&quot; Spartacus added.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, but it's because of what has happened to our own
<br />
mothers and fathers that we're here.  Spartacus, when can we
<br />
speak to the clan elders?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's customary to wait until after the evening's
<br />
festivities.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And even then you may not be heard!&quot; someone croaked. 
<br />
Everyone turned around.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An extremely old badger shuffled toward them, so old that
<br />
two young males held up his arms on either side to enable him
<br />
to walk.  He stared at the Knothole residents with dark, beady
<br />
eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sophocles!&quot; Diana scolded, &quot;you just about scared the life
<br />
out of my son's guests.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As if that gives them the right to address the clan elders!
<br />
I know why you're here.  You can't fight your own battles, so you
<br />
want us to do your work for you.  Well, you'll get no help from
<br />
us, I assure you!&quot;  He motioned with one hand to move off in
<br />
another direction, and the two younger badgers changed course.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's because we fight better than any animal on Mobius.  We
<br />
fight better.  We hunt better.  I can still smell a member of the
<br />
cursed House of Acorn a mile away!&quot;  He rambled on in a similar
<br />
vein until he was out of earshot.  The Knothole Freedom Fighters
<br />
exchanged a glance that communicated the same message: &quot;It's a
<br />
good thing he can't smell one any closer!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pay no mind to Sophocles,&quot; Diana assured the others.  &quot;When
<br />
it comes to remembering the old glory of the clan, he's the worst
<br />
of the lot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I take it he's a clan elder,&quot; Sally observed, handing her
<br />
bowl to Diana for a second helping.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The head elder.  Who's the elder of your clan?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have none.  We live together and fight against Robotnik
<br />
together.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is a 'Robotnik'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik isn't a what, he's a....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Save it for the elders, Sal,&quot; Sonic said.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meal continued with polite conversation; the Freedom
<br />
Fighters made sure the subject of Robotnik didn't come up again. 
<br />
It was going to be a hard enough sell to the elders if the rest
<br />
of them were anything like Sophocles.  Sonic helped Spartacus
<br />
clean up after the meal -- the badgers considered this &quot;sons'
<br />
work&quot; -- while the others left to take part in the evening's
<br />
festivities before the meeting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;festivities&quot; of the evening, like every other evening,
<br />
weren't organized.  Some badgers took ax in hand and used a
<br />
designated tree for target practice.  Others engaged in a tug-of-
<br />
war with a stout rope.  Bunnie and Sally wandered over to a
<br />
crowd of badgers and saw that they were arm-wrestling on an old
<br />
tree stump.  Adonis was among them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You!&quot; he barked, pointing to Bunnie.  &quot;Let's see what that
<br />
arm can do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amid the cheers of the badgers, Sally tried walking away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sally-girl!  They asked for it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie demurely seated herself on one side of the stump
<br />
while Adonis knelt on the other side.  She offered her left hand
<br />
to Adonis, who wrapped his own around it.  At a signal, the
<br />
contest began.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it seemed as if neither contestant had heard the
<br />
signal.  But after a few seconds the crowd realized that both
<br />
contestants were exerting equal strength and that neither had an
<br />
advantage.  Then the action began in earnest.  For the next three
<br />
minutes the momentum shifted from one to the other; just when
<br />
Bunnie seemed about to pin Adonis, the badger would let out a
<br />
roar and raise his hand from the stump, or Bunnie, her hand an
<br />
inch away from the surface, would raise it up as slowly as a
<br />
sunrise.  One of the badgers tried declaring the contest a draw;
<br />
most of the watching crowd disapproved of his attempt.  They
<br />
wanted a fight to the finish.  Finally, after five minutes that
<br />
seemed like an eternity, Adonis slowly worked Bunnie's hand to
<br />
the stump.  It barely grazed the wood but it was enough; Adonis
<br />
was declared the winner to the cheers of the crowd.  Adonis
<br />
extended a hand to Bunnie, who shook it, then got up and began
<br />
walking back to Diana's hut with Sally walking beside her.     
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was very gracious of you, Bunnie,&quot; Sally whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Gracious,' mah bunny behind!  Ah just about blew a
<br />
gasket!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean he actually beat you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally-girl, you do NOT want to get on the bad side of these
<br />
here badgers!  Sorry Ah let our team down,&quot; she added.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look on the bright side; maybe they won't think your
<br />
'armor' is such a good thing after all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine, meanwhile, had been content to watch several
<br />
badgers engage in target practice using hatchets.  Unfortunately,
<br />
he was not content to simply watch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Blue Coat!&quot; one of the badgers yelled.  &quot;Let's see
<br />
what you got!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*Certainment*!&quot; Antoine replied.  He walked up to the line
<br />
where the badgers had been standing; the target tree suddenly
<br />
looked a mile away.  Someone handed him a hatchet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that Antoine discovered that a badger hatchet
<br />
was a large ax to most Mobians.  The thing must have weighed at
<br />
least as much as he himself.  But to his credit, he tried. 
<br />
Grabbing the handle with both hands, he hurled it with all his
<br />
might.  Unfortunately, all his might didn't amount to much and he
<br />
managed to sink the axhead into the ground in front of him.  He
<br />
struggled to maintain his composure while the badgers around him
<br />
roared with laughter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You may have better luck with that one!&quot; one badger said,
<br />
pointing to a nearby ax resting on the ground, handle pointing
<br />
straight upward.  Determined to better his last performance,
<br />
Antoine walked over to it,  reached over behind his head, seized
<br />
the handle and gave a tremendous heave.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Antoine's string of bad luck remained unbroken.  The ax
<br />
was a trick; the handle was only loosely fitted into the axhead
<br />
and it came out cleanly.  The momentum of Antoine's heave carried
<br />
him forward and he landed flat on his face as the badgers once
<br />
more burst into gales of laughter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine still tried to salvage a measure of dignity from
<br />
the debacle.  &quot;You are having some activities that are a bit more
<br />
...philosophical?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this, a badger named Brutus laughed heartily.  &quot;Oh, so
<br />
it's something 'philosophical' you want.  Perhaps you'd like to
<br />
engage in a little something we badgers call 'squaring the
<br />
circle.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, the geometricals!  *Oui*, I would be enjoying that very
<br />
much more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badgers cleared a spot between four stout trees.  Tying
<br />
a rope to the trunk of one tree, they ran it around the other
<br />
trees until it had formed a rough square.  Brutus then stepped
<br />
through the ropes into the center, motioning for Antoine to
<br />
follow.  As he did so, a crowd of badgers gathered around.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only then did Antoine discover that what the badgers called
<br />
&quot;squaring the circle&quot; was a euphemism for no-holds-barred
<br />
wrestling.  Antoine scrambled to get out of the ring, but he was
<br />
either pulled back in by Brutus, or if he did managed to get even
<br />
halfway out another badger would pick him up by the scruff of the
<br />
neck and throw him back in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, having finished helping Diana clear away the dishes,
<br />
worked his way to the edge of the ring, where Sally joined him a
<br />
second later.  They had both heard Antoine's all-too-familiar
<br />
scream, a signal that he had once more gotten in over his head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh!  Sonic, we've got to do something; he'll get
<br />
killed in there!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, however, Antoine became aware that Sally was
<br />
at ringside.  In accordance with the logic of chivalry, this was
<br />
Antoine's cue to attempt the impossible for the sake of his
<br />
princess.  He ran straight for Brutus, as if to tackle him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine's attempt came to nothing; the badger simply put
<br />
Antoine into a bear hug and practically squeezed the life out of
<br />
him, then followed that up with a belly-to-belly suplex.  The
<br />
three-count to signal the end of the match was a formality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Brutus acknowledged the cheers of the crowd, Antoine
<br />
was picked up by the scruff of the neck and placed outside the
<br />
ring.  Sonic and Sally ran up to him, picked him up into an
<br />
uncertain yet upright pose, and guided him back to Diana's
<br />
hut.  His eyes were wide open but unfocused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Ant!  You OK?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*Sachez que je suis a votre disposition.*&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*Je pars dans quelques moments.*&quot;  Having said that, he
<br />
passed out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Forget it, Sal, nobody's home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They left Antoine to sleep it off and resumed watching the
<br />
next wrestling match, this one between two badgers of similar
<br />
size and strength.  After a few seconds, though, someone stepped
<br />
in front of them to block their view.  It was Sophocles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You thought I'd forgotten about you two,&quot; he croaked.  &quot;I
<br />
may be old, but my memory is still good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure it is,&quot; Sally said in a bid to be diplomatic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I remember.  I especially remember every injustice we
<br />
badgers have suffered at the hand of the Acorn kings.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure other badgers have other memories,&quot; she replied
<br />
coolly as she turned her attention to the match.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, they remember the time before the Acorn kings, when
<br />
the throne of Mobius was held in honor.&quot;  Sophocles, too, kept
<br />
his eyes on the ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mobius hasn't been cursed with evil rulers; not until
<br />
Robotnik, at any rate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Even his rule is preferable to the cowards of the House of
<br />
Acorn.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you'd rather see Robotnik on the throne than a member
<br />
of the House of Acorn?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd rather see the throne smashed!  The Acorn Kings have
<br />
thoroughly corrupted it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a curious conversation that they engaged in.  Both
<br />
Sally and Sophocles kept their eyes on the wrestlers, never
<br />
making eye contact with each other.  This style -- known as &quot;side
<br />
talk&quot; -- had evolved into a ritual language of mutual insults in
<br />
the royal court of Mobius.  If cool heads prevailed, such a
<br />
conversation would NOT be a prelude to a duel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clearly, however, this wasn't happening.  Eventually, only a
<br />
handful of badgers and the two wrestlers hadn't stopped to listen
<br />
to the conversation.  Antoine, who had sufficiently recovered his
<br />
wits, had joined Sonic and Bunnie to listen as well.  Both of
<br />
them noticed that Antoine was pale with fright.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The House of Acorn has never been, and never will be, an
<br />
honorable one!  Only little cowards like yourselves would think
<br />
otherwise!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That did it.  Sally broke off the side talk, walked in front
<br />
of Sophocles and looked him in the eye.  &quot;Then if only to shut
<br />
your old mouth, I'm willing to take up the honor of the House of
<br />
Acorn!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A typical Acorn stratagem: to issue a challenge to an old
<br />
badger!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you can name your champion if I can name the place and
<br />
time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Done!  Adonis will be our champion.  Name the place and
<br />
time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the ring!  Right now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Barely managing to control her temper, Sally pulled off her
<br />
vest, unclipped Nicole from the top of her boot, wrapped the
<br />
handheld computer in the vest and handed it to Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally-girl, have y'all lost your mind!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, Sal, you saw what that one goon did to Ant!  And
<br />
Adonis is even bigger!!  I say we juice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I know what I'm doing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Girl, Ah hope so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stepped into the ring where Adonis was waiting. 
<br />
Without any signal that the match had begun, Adonis charged
<br />
straight for her.  Antoine covered his eyes.  A second later,
<br />
however, the crowd of badgers let out a roar.  Fearfully, Antoine
<br />
looked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was still upright, knees slightly bent, her body tense
<br />
and ready.  Adonis was in one corner, flat on his back under one
<br />
of the trees.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sacre bleu cheese!  What has been happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got a chance to see what had happened, for Adonis charged
<br />
at Sally once again.  And just as the time before, Sally deftly
<br />
stepped aside and, grabbing Adonis as he passed her, used his own
<br />
momentum to propel him toward the far corner.  Sonic and Bunnie
<br />
resisted the urge to high-five each other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two more tosses, Adonis found himself down on both
<br />
knees.  As he tried to get up, he put one arm behind him for
<br />
balance.  That was Sally's cue.  Grabbing his wrist with one
<br />
hand, she used her other hand to put pressure on his elbow,
<br />
forcing it to bend in a direction it wasn't meant to bend. 
<br />
Adonis howled in pain; the crowd of badgers let out another roar.
<br />
Sally knew that Adonis wouldn't submit to a simple armbar; she
<br />
did it mainly to buy a few seconds of time to figure out what to
<br />
do next.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What she had to do next, however, was duck a rock that
<br />
someone in the crowd had thrown at her.  That was enough to cause
<br />
her to release Adonis from the armbar.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  That's not fair!&quot; Sonic yelled out.  But before he
<br />
could say or do anything else, a number of badgers in the crowd
<br />
turned toward him with very unfriendly looks.  Sonic realized
<br />
that if he said or did anything now he'd be in the middle of a
<br />
full-scale badger melee.  He shot a quick glance at Spartacus,
<br />
who shook his head slightly.  It was his way of telling Sonic
<br />
that it would be a bad idea to say something like that again. 
<br />
Seething, Sonic backed off a step.  Satisfied that Sonic wasn't
<br />
going to protest further, the badgers turned their attention back
<br />
to the ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation inside the squared circle hadn't changed. 
<br />
Adonis continued to attempt a direct assault on Sally.  And Sally
<br />
continued to either duck out of the way or else use Adonis's
<br />
momentum to hurl him to the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After about a minute more of this, Adonis let out a roar of
<br />
frustration.  The crowd of badgers grew silent.  Then Adonis
<br />
bellowed out one word which electrified the badger crowd: &quot;Claw!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What the hoo-ha's a claw?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THAT,&quot; Spartacus said in a hushed tone, &quot;is the Claw.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A badger handed Adonis a cruel-looking metal glove, covered
<br />
on the back with shining metal spikes.  Adonis made a fist; to
<br />
Sonic, it appeared that the Claw had more spikes than he had
<br />
quills!  Another badger poured a clear liquid over the Claw, as
<br />
if to anoint it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that stuff?&quot; Sonic asked Spartacus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fire water.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's it for?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just hope your friend doesn't find out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another badger was now offering a second Claw to Sally.  She
<br />
took it from him and slipped it on; it practically came up to her
<br />
elbow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Spartacus whispered, &quot;if your friend continues the
<br />
match now, she's either very brave or out of her mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as another badger was about to pour fire water on
<br />
Sally's Claw, however, she motioned him away with her free hand. 
<br />
Then, the tossed the Claw through the ropes to the outside of the
<br />
ring, where its spikes drove into the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That settles it, then.  Your friend's out of her mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more Sally faced off against Adonis.  Adonis wasted no
<br />
time; he lunged at Sally, swinging the Claw from side to side. 
<br />
Once Sonic thought that Sally had been cut, but she stayed on her
<br />
feet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, with a roar of frustration, Adonis raised the Claw
<br />
high in the air and brought it down toward Sally, who again
<br />
managed to dodge out of the way just in time.  But Adonis had
<br />
swung with such force that he buried the spikes of the Claw in
<br />
the ground.  He tugged at it once, but it wouldn't budge.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adonis was on his knees, his eyes level with Sally's.  Sally
<br />
knew she had to work fast.  She hit Adonis with three spin kicks
<br />
to the head in rapid succession, followed by a standing drop kick
<br />
to the head.  Adonis slumped to the ground unconscious, and his
<br />
hand loosed its grip on the inside of the Claw.  That signalled
<br />
the end of the fight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stepped out of the ring, to the sullen silence of the
<br />
crowd.  She started putting on her vest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's get out of here,&quot; she said softly to the others.  &quot;I
<br />
think I just wore out our welcome.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned and looked at Spartacus.  The badger nodded his
<br />
head slightly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then the taunts started.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get back here, runts!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Finish what you started!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just like an Acorn to run away from a fight!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Coward!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This last was the unmistakable voice of Sophocles.  Sonic
<br />
had heard enough.  He was about to turn around and confront the
<br />
old badger when Sally grabbed him tightly by the upper arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let it go,&quot; she whispered through clenched teeth.  &quot;Just
<br />
keep walking!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On they walked, Sally maintaining a fast pace.  Finally she
<br />
asked: &quot;You think we're beyond their hearing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think so, Sal, but....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One, two, three four,&quot; she said as she began counting her
<br />
steps out loud.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the deal, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just making sure, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
<br />
eighteen, nineteen, twenty.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the count of twenty, Sally let out a cry like a pup and
<br />
dropped to the ground, holding her abdomen.  Her face was pinched
<br />
in agony and tears flowed from her eyes.  Her breath came in
<br />
gasps and pants.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal!  What's wrong?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is happening to you, my Princess?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sally was clearly in too much pain to answer.  So Sonic
<br />
scooped her up in his arms and, with Antoine hanging onto his
<br />
neck and Bunnie hanging onto Antoine's, he juiced back to
<br />
Knothole.
<br />
