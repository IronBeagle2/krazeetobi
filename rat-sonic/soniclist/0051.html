<br />
After reading all these responses and arguments and opinions about my 
<br />
reference  to Sally's species, I must input a vital issue...
<br />

<br />
It seems that for a very long time (respectively) the comic book artists/writers
<br />
and the SatAM show artists/writers were not conversing on just what SHOULD
<br />
BE the one true version of this epic &quot;tail&quot;;)...As a result, each is having 
<br />
trouble
<br />
deciding on what to do next.  (ie. since Sally has apparently been refered to
<br />
as a ground squirrel in the comic, it's hard to say what she is in the cartoon)
<br />

<br />
I personally have always thought of her as a vixen (female fox), however, I
<br />
also have only been exposed to the cartoon show - which has never stated 
<br />
what she is one way or another.  Vixen status seemed to be reinforced 
<br />
after seeing her father, but I've even heard  arguments that HE isn't a fox! 
<br />
(those arguments were lost,BTW)  You may dissagree because it said 
<br />
different in the comic book, but as I said before, those 2 media haven't been
<br />
keeping tabs on one another very closely.(I don't know why)
<br />

<br />
Also, the Sonic books differ from both the comic &amp; the show!
<br />

<br />
As for her mother, well, usually in royalty cross-breeding is discouraged.  
<br />
Besides, if you were going to write in a girlfriend for Sonic what better choice
<br />
than a vixen!  &lt;droool&gt; (followup in a.f.f) 
<br />

<br />
AS A RESULT, we have a big mess.  Unless the different media can work out a 
<br />
single, unified plot line with character development which explains Sally's 
<br />
species
<br />
(among many other things) there may never be an answer to this all important 
<br />
question...Sally, What is your name? 
<br />
(I fear that soon even this simple question could be skewed by the different 
<br />
media)
<br />

<br />
P.S. &quot;Princess Sally Allicia&quot; is what has been revealed in the show
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(In case you were wondering ;)      )
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
***Everyone needs to believe in something,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe I'll have another beer            ***
