<br />
<br />Timeline: After &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, but before &quot;Doomsday&quot;.  *shrug*
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br />
<br />The starship hummed as it approached the solar system.  The apparently
<br />
doorless, windowless, disc-shaped reddish interplanetary vehicle dropped out
<br />
of warpspace, and dropped to conventional ion drive.  Readjusting its
<br />
bearings slightly, and cloaking itself in order to avoid detection, it 
<br />
headed toward a medium-sized planet, roughly 92 million miles from its 
<br />
sun.  It was an quite inviting, beautiful looking place, that had the    
<br />
possibility of supporting millions upon millions of different lifeforms.
<br />
Usually, these planets developed intelligent life within 4 billion years or
<br />
so after their initial creation.  This planet was one of them.
<br />
<br />The inhabitants of this planet called it &quot;Mobius&quot;.
<br />
<br />The ship first detected the signs of an post-industrial planet three
<br />
years ago, as it was doing a routine scan through various frequencies.  The
<br />
signals were several years old, but they indicated this &quot;Mobius&quot; was a
<br />
relatively peaceful planet, with only a single squabble between city states
<br />
bothering the otherwise serene world.  But, according to a signal the
<br />
ship had picked up a bit later, a man called &quot;Julian&quot; had apparently beaten
<br />
them.  The last signal the ship recieved was that a sort of gala
<br />
celebration was going to occur to honor this man with a more peaceful
<br />
position in the government.  But just as the party was scheduled to begin,
<br />
a meteorite finally achieved the 1.679 x 10^80 against to one  
<br />
probablility of something penetrating the shields and damaging the 
<br />
communications array, and the ship was unable to recieve any further
<br />
information about the planet.
<br />
<br />Noting the occurance in the ship's log, the computer set a course for the
<br />
origin of the signals with the maximum allowed speed for the ship; exactly
<br />
99.9% of the speed of light.  (The ship's computer was programmed with a 
<br />
directive that forbade it from going faster than light while on 
<br />
autopilot, because of the various unpredictable things that could occur 
<br />
in jumpspace.) A few years had passed since the beginning of the journey
<br />
and its current status, but the ship assumed (with less than a 2% margin of
<br />
error, according to its calculations of probablility according to the
<br />
information it had recieved) that the planet had not changed dramatically
<br />
within the past several years.
<br />
<br />And now, the ship was slowing to a slow orbit around the planet, and was
<br />
doing a sensor sweep in order to determine the planet's exact status.
<br />
Needless to say, the ship was mostly correct.  The planet still appeared to
<br />
be a relative paradise.  However, one dramatic change had occured.  The
<br />
coordinates of the capital city, which was described as an &quot;garden city&quot;,
<br />
was now covered in a black-grey smog cloud.  Had some sort of volcanic
<br />
eruption occured?  The ship reconfigured its sensors scanned for
<br />
carbon-based lifeforms.  Two showed up, both of them apparently bipedal, 
<br />
evolved simians.  Obviously, the ship hypothesised, some sort of major 
<br />
catastrophe had severely damaged the city, and had only left two survivors.
<br />
However, the ship also detected motion below.  Switching to IR, it peered
<br />
through the murky clouds, and spotted several thousand bipedal machines,
<br />
vaguely resembling various evolved mammals, doing various tasks.  The ship
<br />
was puzzled for a moment, and then came to the conclusion that they could
<br />
possibly be cyborgs.  Sure enough, when the ship scanned for cybernetic
<br />
lifeforms, the beings below showed up on the scans.
<br />
<br />Now the ship was in a quandry.  Within a few years, Mobitropolis had
<br />
apparently switched from garden city to ultra-industrial megacomplex for no
<br />
obvious or logical reason.  The view of the environment must have radically
<br />
changed for the leaders of the planet, the ship surmised, or else they
<br />
would not be damaging it so.  Whoever decided on this decision must have
<br />
felt they were under some sort of threat, because the ship then detected
<br />
beam weaponry on the planet's surface.  But from what?  Nothing threatened
<br />
them from space, for they were the only inhabited world around for several
<br />
light years.  The rest of the planet appeared relatively uninhabited, and
<br />
there were surely no armies on the planet capable of damaging that city.
<br />
<br />As if to disprove the ship's assumption in an ironic sense, a large
<br />
explosion was suddenly detected within the limits of the city.
<br />
<br />The explosion was apparently caused by a sort of sabotage, for a platoon of
<br />
heavily armed robots was racing toward it, firing at an unknown 
<br />
terrorist that the ship could not detect (due to the severe interference).
<br />
Moments later, the firing ceased.  Either the shots had reached their
<br />
target, or the terrorist had escaped.  The ship was about to note the
<br />
first in its log when a very fast-moving bluish object was detected racing
<br />
toward the area called &quot;The Great Forest&quot;.  Before a scan could be
<br />
activated, it was gone.  
<br />
<br />The ship had come to the conclusion that this planet was not a good place
<br />
to land.  Apparently, some sort of major upheaval had occured, and the area
<br />
did not look very inviting.  It decided to leave before something else
<br />
happened.  
<br />
<br />However, the ship then realized it would have to power down its cloak in
<br />
order to pull out of orbit, and expose itself to whichever inhabitants were
<br />
running things down on Mobius' surface.  Also, if it left orbit, it would
<br />
be unable to find another suitable planet to land on, due to the damage
<br />
done to the communications array.  It now had no choice but to land.
<br />
Protocol demanded it land away from a settled area.  Fortunately, those
<br />
were widespread...  It also wanted to land someplace where it could decloak
<br />
and remain covered.  Scanning the surface, it discovered a small 
<br />
clearing deep within the Great Forest that could it could safely land in, 
<br />
which had no large or intelligent life forms around it.  Not only that, a 
<br />
small creek was spotted no more than 10 yards away from the center of the 
<br />
site.  It would be an ideal place to land in.  
<br />
<br />It decended into the atmosphere without disrupting it enough for anyone to
<br />
really notice.  It soared above the Great Forest, found the spot it had
<br />
selected from orbit, and descended into it.  Moments later, the ship had
<br />
landed uneventfully and silently within the small clearing.  
<br />
<br />After the landing had completed, the ship set up a camoflaged canopy so to
<br />
keep the ship from being spotted from orbit.  After all, it couldn't remain
<br />
cloaked indefinitely, and when the ship's passenger finally emerged, he
<br />
would wish to work in secret.  In seconds, the clearing no longer appeared
<br />
to exist from any altitude higher than 10 feet above it.  
<br />
<br />Things were moving along rather smoothly.  All that was left to be done was
<br />
to reactivate the pilot, and the repairs on the ship could begin.  
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Immediately behind the cockpit, an area had been set up for the cryogenic
<br />
storage of a single individual.  As the ship began to power back up the
<br />
area, it slowly became visible to an observer's sight.  It was basically a
<br />
single man-sized tube, connected to a coolant pipe and a computer.  The
<br />
computer began to hum as the pipe began to withdraw from the tube.  Then, 
<br />
from the back of the room, a small laser powered up and began to fire at
<br />
the tube.  It slowly began to grow red from the laser's heat.  After a
<br />
predetermined period of time, it ceased.  The ship then removed whatever
<br />
liquid remained in the tube, and pumped it outside.  Finally, it
<br />
appeared the process had been completed. The tube opened up so to
<br />
allow its contents to exit, and the machinery shut down.
<br />
<br />Jhoeseophae awoke groggily from his long slumber.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Arrgh.&quot;&gt;&gt; he muttered
<br />
as he wandered over and put on his clothes.  He stumbled over to the
<br />
replicator, generated something hot and wet, and threw it down his throat.
<br />
Now with most of his faculties active, he wandered over to the mirror.
<br />
As a test of his cognative abilities, he decided to examine himself as an
<br />
impartial observer, and see what he could infer about himself from
<br />
a quick examination.
<br />
<br />The green eyes bored into his face.  He was a vulpine, bipedal and highly
<br />
evolved.  Orange fur.  Eyes that seemed to radiate intelligence.  
<br />
Razor-sharp teeth.  Slight muscular build, but somewhat apathied from the
<br />
long period in stasis.  Roughly 23 years old.  On the tall and slim side 
<br />
for his species, standing at about 6'4&quot; and roughly 180 pounds.  
<br />
<br />Seeing that his mental faculties were operating at optimum efficiency, he
<br />
went over to his wardrobe and threw on some clothes.  A pair of
<br />
fashionably-frayed denim pants, with a pair of knee-high black metal-tipped
<br />
boots were laying about, so he put those on.  Platinum-buckled belt, and a 
<br />
green t-shirt...didn't look THAT dirty...  Fingerless gloves were already 
<br />
on, so had to complement the ensemble with his grey trenchcoat.  Voila.  
<br />
Instant cool.
<br />
<br />Now that he felt pretty good about himself, he wandered into the cockpit to
<br />
discuss his awakening with the ship's AI, Bahb.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Okay,&quot;&gt;&gt; said 
<br />
Jhoeseophae aloud, sitting down in the captain's chair, &lt;&lt;&quot;where are we, 
<br />
Bahb?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;We are on a planet called Mobius.&quot;&gt;&gt; spake the computer in a sexless,
<br />
mechanical voice.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Tell me what you know about Mobius, Bahb.&quot;&gt;&gt; said Jhoeseophae.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
And Bahb did.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;This is not good, Bahb, you know that?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Affirmative.  Landing on this planet at this stage of its development is
<br />
not advised.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Then why are we here?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Repairs required for communications array.  Cannot continue with mission
<br />
until repaired.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;So we're stuck here, on a planet in the midst of an all-out war, with a
<br />
busted radio and no place to go until I fix it?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Affirmative.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;How do I fix it, Bahb?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Unknown.  Pilot intervention required.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Jhoeseophae mused over this point, grabbed some tools laying next to the
<br />
seat, and walked over to the hatch.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Open the hatch, Bahb.&quot;&gt;&gt; he said, and it was.
<br />
<br />Jhoeseophae emerged out into the canopy's filtered moonlight.  The area
<br />
appeared fairly healthy.  The plants were green, and the water looked crisp
<br />
and clear.  It didn't look like a industrial hell, and certainly didn't
<br />
have the aura of death about it.  After a few deep breaths, he padded 
<br />
quietly over to the area of the smooth, oval-shaped ship's 
<br />
communications array.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Arrgh.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The communications array looked totaled.  Something a tad larger than a
<br />
full-grown vulpine's head had hit the thing, and hit it hard.  Most of the
<br />
parts were pulverized.  He sighed.  Jhoeseophae was incapable of 
<br />
repairing it, even with his arsenal of technological knowledge.  
<br />
He walked back into the ship, and sat back down in the captain's chair.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Aye.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;We got any extra communications arrays back there?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Negative.  However, one could be replicated.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Do you have enough power to do that?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Negative.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Somehow, he had expected that would be the answer.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Are there any power sources on the planet you could utilize?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Scanning.  Please wait.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />He waited for about 3 minutes, and then heard:
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Potential energy source located.&quot;&gt;&gt;, Bahb beeped, &lt;&lt;&quot;Designation: 
<br />
Crystalline.&quot;&gt;&gt;  Jhosesophae's hope began to rise until he heard, 
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;Location:&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb suddenly fell silent. &lt;&lt;&quot;Electromagnetic flux from
<br />
Mobitropolis makes exact location currently unavailable.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />He sighed.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Any good raves on Mobius, Bahb?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Robotropolis, shortly after the &quot;terrorist attack&quot;:
<br />
<br />Snively hated his life some days, with a bottomless, infinite passion.  
<br />
This was one of those days.  Yet again the Freedom Fighters (curse them!)
<br />
had detonated another vital part of Robotropolis, and yet again Snively had
<br />
to be the bearer of bad news.  He didn't know why, just once, a SWAT Bot
<br />
couldn't tell Robotnik the bad news.  At least they were expendable.  Of
<br />
course, in Robotnik's red, glowing eyes, so was he...
<br />
<br />He wandered into the Death Egg's control room, where Robotnik spent the
<br />
majority of his day.  He was sitting there in his chair, tapping his left
<br />
index finger on the left armrest.  Just sitting there, waiting.  
<br />
<br />Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.  Tap.
<br />
<br />Robotnik spoke first.  &quot;Let me guess, Snively,&quot; Robotnik sneered, not
<br />
turning around, &quot;you have bad news for me, don't you?&quot;
<br />
<br />Snively started stuttering.  &quot;Umm...y-y-yes, Dr. Robotnik.  Umm...the #6
<br />
Refinery, uh, uhmm...&quot;
<br />
<br />Robotnik spun the chair around, and glared at Snively with all his might.
<br />
&quot;#6 was DESTROYED, wasn't IT?!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhh...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Shut up!&quot; Robotnik roared with all his might, &quot;I *know* about the #6
<br />
Refinery, you simpering dullard!&quot;  Robotnik lept out of his chair, grabbed 
<br />
Snively by the scruff of the neck before he had a chance to get away, and 
<br />
shoved him against the screen showing the flaming wreckage of the said 
<br />
refinery being cleaned up by various robotizised citizens.  &quot;I *watched* 
<br />
the attack from HERE!&quot;  Snively could only freeze in a sort of delayed 
<br />
survival instinct.  &quot;Didn't I tell you last week to TRIPLE the amount of
<br />
SWAT Bots guarding the refinery zones?  DIDN'T I?!?  After all, they
<br />
attacked #1 a month and a half ago, #2 5 weeks ago, #3 the next week, etc!
<br />
We've only got the #7 *left* now, Snively!  WE are going to be SHUT DOWN 
<br />
unless we can keep #7 up!  Do you know what that MEANS?!?&quot; 
<br />
<br />Snively desperately tried to defend himself as Dr. Robotnik twisted his arm
<br />
around so that Snively and him were now eye-to-eye.  In a burst of
<br />
confusion mized with fear, Snively uttered, &quot;I d-d-did t-triple the 
<br />
amount, sir...&quot;
<br />
<br />Dr. Robotnik roared in rage, and threw Snively at the nearest wall, which
<br />
he collided into painfully.  Robotnik then strode over to the intercom, and
<br />
pushed the button down with a sudden calm.  &quot;Quintruple the amount of SWAT
<br />
Bots guarding #7 Refinery.&quot;  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; a voice on the other side spoke.
<br />
<br />Repressing the remainder of his anger, he sat back down in his chair, and
<br />
stared into the viewscreens.  He was now seriously depressed.  Repairs were
<br />
continuing on the first few refineries, but the first one that was
<br />
destroyed would not be operational for another 2 days from then.  If that
<br />
blasted hedgehog attacked #7 tomorrow (which he probably would, considering
<br />
that if he did, it would annoy Robotnik further), and destroyed it,
<br />
Robotropolis would probably have to slow down for a few days until the new
<br />
refinery went up, which they would, of course, attack.  
<br />
<br />He was at a critical point now.  If they were able to continue destroying
<br />
his refineries, he'd have to either shut down or find an alternative, more
<br />
efficient, and probably (yuck) cleaner energy source for Robotropolis.  The
<br />
whole scenerio depressed him.  Even beating the crap out of Snively (who was
<br />
up against the wall, wheezing) didn't make him feel better.  He growled,
<br />
pounded his fist against the armrest, and swore for a little bit about the
<br />
hedgehog's demise until he felt somewhat more civil.  Suddenly, he thought 
<br />
of a way to make himself feel better, yet do something constructive at 
<br />
the same time.  
<br />
<br />He pushed the intercom button again.  &quot;Bring up a prisoner, please.&quot;, he
<br />
said evilly.  He always put on an air of faux politeness when about to
<br />
torture the living daylights out of another sentinent being.  &quot;Sorry,&quot; the 
<br />
voice said, &quot;we don't have any prisoners left, sir.  You robotisized them 
<br />
all yesterday.&quot;  Robotnik blinked.  &quot;What?!?&quot;  The voice sounded less 
<br />
sure of itself.  &quot;Yes, sir, don't you remember?  21:00 Robotropolis 
<br />
Central Time.&quot;  He snarled.  &quot;Then go out and capture some then, and tell 
<br />
me when you get them here!&quot;  Sharply, the voice said, &quot;Yes, sir!&quot; and
<br />
disappeared into silence.  
<br />
<br />Robotnik then looked over to the fairly-recovered Snively.  &quot;Snively,&quot; he
<br />
said casually, &quot;make yourself useful and go with some SWAT Bots on their
<br />
little hunt.&quot; Snively just nodded, and ran out of the room.  After he was a
<br />
fair distance away, Robotnik muttered, &quot;Good help is so hard to find these
<br />
days.&quot; and began a perimeter sweep of Robotropolis.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Knothole, after the attack:
<br />
<br />The usual small celebration was going on over the destruction of yet
<br />
another Robotnik installation.  Sonic, was, of course, drinking in all of
<br />
the positive attention and recieving most of the compliments; while Sally
<br />
and Rotor, who accompanied Sonic on that mission, would occasionally roll 
<br />
their eyes at some of the hedgehog's more gratuitous exaggerations.  After 
<br />
a few more minutes, the celebration came to an end, and the trio wandered 
<br />
back into Sally's hut to discuss the next mission.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; said she, &quot;we're in good shape, guys.  Robotnik only has one more 
<br />
refinery left, so Robotropolis is almost completely come to a halt now.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah!&quot; spoke the blue wonder, &quot;So, what time tomorrow do we go to destroy 
<br />
lucky #7?  I'll set my alarm.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Sonic,&quot; Sally said, &quot;if we went off and tried to destroy that refinery, 
<br />
we might as well just walk up to Robotnik and surrender.  We barely got 
<br />
out of this one alive.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Sonic started tapping his foot on the ground, and crossed his arms.  &quot;Well, if
<br />
that's the way you feel about it, Sal, I'll do it myself!  I know how Rotor
<br />
plants the bombs!  *I* can do it!&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally looked over at Rotor.  &quot;Well,&quot; the walrus said, &quot;they aren't really
<br />
*that* complex.  All he'd have to to is type in however much time he'd need
<br />
on the first one, and all the others would sync.&quot;
<br />
<br />Noting that point, Sally mentally selected another one and glared at Sonic.
<br />
&quot;Are you insane?!  Robotnik will at least have 400 SWAT Bots in there, and 
<br />
you KNOW they'll be on alert now.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic smirked, and gesticulated his arms in a manner an umpire denotes a 
<br />
player is &quot;safe&quot;.  &quot;A few hundred 'bots won't slow me down.  It'll be a
<br />
breeze.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;A *breeze*?!&quot; Sally shouted, &quot;You'll be slaughtered!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ha!&quot; the blue one noted, &quot;I'll be there and back before they'll even
<br />
notice the attack!&quot; and snapped his fingers.
<br />
<br />&quot;Sonic...&quot; she pleaded, &quot;I forbid you to do this.  It's just too
<br />
dangerous.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I *live* on danger!&quot; cried the hedgehog, &quot;and if I pull this one off,
<br />
Robotnik will REALLY be hurtin'!  C'mon, Sal, let me do it!&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally looked over at Sonic.  &quot;Look, I'll tell you in the morning.  I need
<br />
to consider this, okay?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic smiled.  &quot;Sure, Sal, no sweat.  You know where to find me.&quot;  With
<br />
that, he powered himself up and rocketed out the door.  Lightly grabbing 
<br />
any stable objects, Sally and Rotor rode out the shockwave with a minimum 
<br />
of distress.
<br />
<br />&quot;You're going to let him go, aren't you?&quot; said Rotor softly.
<br />
<br />She sighed.  &quot;Do I really have a choice?  Even if I say no, he'll go.&quot;
<br />
She took a breath.  &quot;At least if I tell him when to go, I'll be able to see
<br />
him leave...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Now Sally,&quot; Rotor spake, &quot;don't act like that.  Sonic will come back from
<br />
this one.  I just know it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally walked over to the window, and stared up into the night sky.  
<br />
&quot;I just hope you're right, Rotor.&quot;
<br />
<br />Suddenly, Tails walked in.  &quot;Aunt Sally,&quot; he said, &quot;we're out of berries
<br />
again.  Should I go out and pick some tomorrow?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally sighed.  &quot;Uh, sure, Tails.  Could you take Bunnie with you?  She's
<br />
been pacing around here bored.&quot;
<br />
<br />Tails smiled.  &quot;Sure, Aunt Sally, it'll be my pleasure!&quot;
<br />

<br />
<br />A new day broke over the Great Forest.  Light streamed in through the
<br />
leaves of the various trees, and most of the animals, sentinent and
<br />
non-sentinent alike, were awakened.  
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae came out of sleep mode, and forced himself to stand.  A 
<br />
rapid exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen occured, and his appendeges were 
<br />
properly recalibrated.  (To a layman, that would be percieved as Jhosesophae
<br />
yawning and stretching out.) 
<br />
<br />He wandered over to the replicator, created a yellow cube about 5 cubic 
<br />
inches in volume, and began eating it.  He wandered into the cockpit, sat
<br />
down in the chair, and activated the screen.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Status report.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Bahb beeped back to life as Jhosesophae reclined and ate his cube.  
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;In a two klick radius around the ship, approximately 1.5 small mammals 
<br />
had been detected moving in the last 12 hours.  None have come within one 
<br />
klick of the ship.  4 birds had been detected flying above the ship at a 
<br />
average altitude of 100 yards above sea level.  150 worms have been noted 
<br />
approxamately 2 inches below the landing gear.  The temperature outside is 
<br />
+73.5 degrees.  The probability it will remain clear today is 95.1%.  Fuel
<br />
level is at 75% of maximum.  Communications array is down.  Weapons, cloak,
<br />
shields, navigation, transporters, propulsion, sensors, life support and 
<br />
cryogenic storage are on standby.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae finished his cube.  &lt;&lt;&quot;We need to get those crystals, Bahb.  Do
<br />
you detect any mines or above-ground sources of them today?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Electromagnetic flux is currently low enough for a precise scan.&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb
<br />
tweeted proudly, &lt;&lt;&quot;Now scanning for crystals.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Confirmed.&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb beeped.  &lt;&lt;&quot;An enterance to a mine system exists
<br />
exactly 3 miles from here, in the center of a whirlpool.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;I hate water,&quot;&gt;&gt; Jhosesophae uttered, &lt;&lt;&quot;But I hate being marooned even
<br />
more.&quot;&gt;&gt; Jhosesophae grabbed his microcomputer from a shelf, walked to the
<br />
replicator, and placed it on the replicator's altar.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, waterproof
<br />
and charge this device.&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb quietly did so, with a pulse of plasmatic
<br />
energy.  He then removed the computer from the pad.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, link with
<br />
this device.&quot;&gt;&gt; Suddenly, Bahb's voice was heard from the small speaker on
<br />
the device.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Affirmative.&quot;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae took a small stun weapon from another counter as he walked into
<br />
the transporter tube.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, teleport me as close as you possibly can to
<br />
the enterence to the mine, but keep me distant from other life forms.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
Bahb didn't answer.  It merely set coordinates and shot Jhosesophae through
<br />
the atmosphere.
<br />
<br />Seconds later, Jhosesophae rematerialized about 5 feet from the edge of the
<br />
whirlpool.  He noted that this was where the creek ended that ran by the
<br />
side of his craft.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, copy.&quot;&gt;&gt;, not expecting an answer.
<br />
<br />The device beeped somewhat with some light static, &lt;&lt;&quot;On standby.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae suddenly realized that this was technically impossible.  
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, how are you doing this?&quot;&gt;&gt; 
<br />
<br />The device uttered, &lt;&lt;&quot;Your microcomputer has a seperate communications
<br />
array than the central one on the ship.  A small version of the main array,
<br />
with a lesser range, is implanted inside the ship.  That is how my signals
<br />
are reaching you.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Oh,&quot;&gt;&gt; Jhosesophae said, &lt;&lt;&quot;that makes sense.  How much further away can
<br />
you reach me from?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;You can go either 100 more miles in any direction horizontally or
<br />
straight up, or 5 feet straight down.  The soil on this planet is
<br />
interfering with the array.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae grumbled.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Very well.  I'm going down the whirlpool now, and
<br />
I'm leaving my communicator up here.  I will try to report back on an
<br />
regular basis.  Over and out.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Affirmative.  Good luck.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />As Bahb fell silent, Jhosesophae looked down into the watery pit.  Thinking
<br />
about the approximate size of the crystal he was going to need, and the
<br />
fact that it was probably going to weigh an excessive amount, he calmly
<br />
removed his trenchcoat, boots and jeans, and folded them neatly beneath the
<br />
microcomputer.  Then, grabbing the stun pistol in his jaws, he plunged 
<br />
beneath the surface.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />He swam as hard as he could down through the narrow passageway.  Lower and
<br />
lower he went into the hole, descending deep into the heart of the
<br />
underground caverns.  Suddenly, he felt a current pulling behind him. 
<br />
Instinctively following it, he swam for another few yards until he slowly
<br />
began to see a dim light further ahead.  Pouring on the speed, he
<br />
determinedly swam toward the light, and finally emerged inside an
<br />
airpocket.  As he took some much-needed oxygen into his system, he glanced 
<br />
around at his surroundings.  
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, a creature was watching the vulpine's movement within the
<br />
tunnel, and silently waited for him to exit it again.
<br />
<br />He was floating by the shore of an currently unused crystal vein.  They
<br />
lined the walls, and glowed with a mysterious, yet beautiful, light.  As he
<br />
pulled himself onto a slab of granite, he marvelled at the strange calm
<br />
that this room seemed to have about it.  He stood there for a minute or two
<br />
on the inlet, and then resigned himself to his work.  He found a crystal
<br />
that appeared to be of a medium-size, and used his stun-ray to cut it off
<br />
the side of the cavern.  After it had been freed from the wall, he tucked
<br />
it under his shoulder, put the stun-ray back in his mouth, and dove back
<br />
into the water.
<br />
<br />This had been much easier than expected, he thought to himself, and he
<br />
could probably get off this planet before anyone ever knew he was there.
<br />
<br />The creature saw the fox leave the cavern, and silently prepared itself for
<br />
a filling meal.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />As Jhosesophae swam back through the tunnel, and out toward the shaft
<br />
leading back up to the surface, a shape shot past him, startling him.
<br />
He dropped the crystal out of an instinctual reaction to the threat, and
<br />
tried to swim as fast as he could up the shaft.  But whatever darted past
<br />
him saw this intent, and wrapped a sort of tenticle around his leg,
<br />
restraining his escape.  He turned to face whatever was grabbing him, and
<br />
suddenly realized he was in a deep spot of trouble.
<br />
<br />It seemed to be some sort of robotic octupus.  But this particular model
<br />
was also outfitted with a a beak made out of two chainsaws, lazer beams by
<br />
its eyes, and incredibly strong tendrils with little spikes on them.  Very
<br />
*sharp* spikes, because they hurt a lot and were making him bleed.  
<br />
<br />Pain made him mad.
<br />
<br />With a sort of psychotic glee, he took the stun pistol from his mouth, and 
<br />
set the device to maximum power.  Looking over at the creature, he smiled
<br />
and shot it a &quot;big mistake there, pal&quot; look, and blasted the evil thing right 
<br />
inbetwixt the eyes.  It released his leg, and seemed to stumble backwards,
<br />
if such a thing is possible underwater.  But the thing was not yet dead. 
<br />
It fired several shots of a sort of death-ray beam at Jhosesophae, and
<br />
emitted a &quot;HALT FREEDOM FIGHTER!&quot; at him.  However, since Jhosesophae was
<br />
not familiar with the Mobian language, he had no idea that this thing was
<br />
actually one of Dr. Robotnik's defense mechanisms that was posted on the
<br />
outskirts of the mine's underground river.  He dodged the beams and blasted
<br />
the thing in the head again with his particular beam weapon.  It reeled
<br />
again from the impacts, but had one last trick up its robotic sleeves.  It
<br />
whipped one of its tendrils around like a mace and shot several of the
<br />
spikes off its tendrils at Jhosesophae.  He was able to dodge the majority
<br />
of them, but a few of them caught him in the back, giving the holes in his
<br />
leg some company.
<br />
<br />At this point, Jhosesophae was so incredibly mad at this creature, he had
<br />
completely forgotten about the crystal and was now dedicated to totally
<br />
decimating this creature once and for all.  He rushed at the octupus and
<br />
knocked it against the wall.  While it was stunned, Jhosesophae ran at it,
<br />
and tore at the holes that he had put in the octupus, looking for anything
<br />
that looked vital and smashing it to bits.  It tried to thrash around, but
<br />
Jhosesophae would not let it get away.  Finally, he spotted the CPU of the
<br />
evil machine and punched it with all his might.
<br />
<br />With a single whistle, the machine sunk to the bottom of the cavern, never
<br />
to move again.  
<br />
<br />Having stopped the threat, Jhosesophae dove down to the bottom of the 
<br />
cavern.  He collected his crystal, and swam back up to the surface to catch
<br />
his breath.  He hoped this sort of thing wasn't going to happen to him
<br />
often while he was here.  This planet was becoming less hospitable every
<br />
day.  
<br />
<br />He returned back to the bright sunlight of the surface.  Placing the
<br />
crystal next to the communicator, he spoke, &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, copy.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Welcome back, Jhosesophae.&quot;&gt;&gt; the device said, &lt;&lt;&quot;Were you sucessful in
<br />
your endevor?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Affirmative.  Will this crystal suffice?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Bahb scanned the crystal.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Negative.  One more is required of this size
<br />
in order to properly replicate the communications array.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae sighed.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Confirmed.  Be back in a minute.&quot;&gt;&gt; He dreaded
<br />
returning to the area, in case there were more of the things that attacked
<br />
him down there, but he wanted off this crazy rock extremely badly.  He dove
<br />
back down beneath the water with his stun ray in tow, and hoped he'd never 
<br />
have to do this again.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />A few hundred yards away, on a trail leading close by to the pool in
<br />
question, Bunnie was escorting Tails back to Knothole.  She'd never say
<br />
that in front of Tails, of course, because Tails felt that he was competent
<br />
enough to pick some raspberries, which he had done sucessfully, and take
<br />
them back to Knothole himself.  The reason Bunnie was coming along, Tails
<br />
believed, was because she was going slightly stir-crazy from hanging around
<br />
Knothole for so long without going on a mission.  Besides, Sonic was busy
<br />
planning his strategy for tonight's mission, and was unavailable.    
<br />
<br />&quot;Thanks for lettin' me come along wit'cha, Tails,&quot; Bunnie said,
<br />
perpetuating the ruse, &quot;I was gettin' kinda bored helpin' out Rotor all
<br />
day.&quot; Like Sonic gets tired of eatin' chili dogs, she thought, smiling
<br />
internally...
<br />
<br />&quot;It's okay, Aunt Bunnie.&quot; Tails said politely, snapping her out of her
<br />
daydream.  Suddenly, Tails saw something glitter through the trees over 
<br />
by the pond.  He placed his arm out in front of Bunnie, and gestured toward
<br />
the pond.  In a unspoken understanding, they slipped quietly off the trail
<br />
and walked in a semicircle behind the source of the shine.  They slipped
<br />
almost immediately behind it when they saw its source; a large chunk of
<br />
crystal. 
<br />
<br />This puzzled the both of them.  That size crystal just doesn't grow on the
<br />
land.  Only ones that are found underground grow that large.  &quot;We should
<br />
get a closer look,&quot; Tails whispered, &quot;in case it *did* just happen to end
<br />
up there.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Bunnie was slightly more conservative.  &quot;Ya wanna get yer head shot off, 
<br />
sugar?  This looks like a trap!  We should go back to Knothole and tell 
<br />
Sal 'bout this.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;And how,&quot; Tails muttered, &quot;do you expect to get back to Knothole?  The
<br />
path is the only way I know of from here.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bunnie was stumped for an answer.  She didn't know another way, either.
<br />
&quot;Okay, sugar,&quot; she said to Tails, &quot;but you go back to Knothole and tell
<br />
everyone, okay?&quot;  Tails nodded, gained some altitude, and flew off toward
<br />
Knothole.  After he was out of sight, she cautiously crept closer
<br />
to the pond.  As she got closer, she noticed a pair of black boots next to 
<br />
a pile of clothing, with a microcomputer like Sally had next to it.  &quot;Y'all
<br />
went for a swim?&quot; she thought as she crept closer, gazing upon the crystal.
<br />
&quot;Then what d'y'all need such a big crystal for?  They don' float...&quot;
<br />
<br />Suddenly, the computer tweeted threateningly at her.  &quot;Halt, Mobian 
<br />
intruder!&quot; it shouted in perfect Mobian.  Bunnie looked dumbfounded at the
<br />
machine.  &quot;Huh?&quot; she said, confused.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Halt!  Halt!&quot;
<br />
<br />Realizing she was still walking, she ceased.  &quot;What's your problem, little
<br />
computer?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;You are permitted to go no closer.  Go back!&quot;  As to accent this point,
<br />
the computer somehow fired some energy beams in the air until she started
<br />
to back up.
<br />
<br />Slowly, she backed up, back into the forest, until she noticed blood in the
<br />
water, and started putting two and two together.  Clothing by a pool.  
<br />
Blood in the water.  A belligerent, armed computer.  And then, two or three
<br />
bubbles popped on the surface of the water, as to be sure she understood
<br />
what was going on here.  She came to the conclusion that the device was
<br />
somehow picking people off who walked by the path (which was no more than
<br />
2-3feet from the edge of the water).  She couldn't just leave the thing
<br />
there in good conscience undistrubed.  So, as she passed by a nearby
<br />
boulder, she kicked it at the microcomputer.  It fired at the rock, but it
<br />
ricocheted off the rock and hit Bunnie's abdomen instead, knocking her 
<br />
unconscious.  As Bunnie hit the ground, the rock hit the microcomputer.  If
<br />
the ground would have been hard, it would have broken it.  However, the
<br />
soft mud gave way beneath it, and it sunk underneath it harmlessly.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />This probably could have been avoided if Jhosesophae had gotten the last
<br />
crystal at a slightly more rapid pace.  Unfortunately, accidents happen,
<br />
and Jhosesophae surfaced just seconds after the incident occured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb,&quot;&gt;&gt; Jhosesophae said, wiping water from his eyes, &lt;&lt;&quot;I've got the
<br />
last crystal.  Do you co--&quot;&gt;&gt; Suddenly, he noticed what had just happened.
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;Oh no.&quot;&gt;&gt; He turned over the rock, grabbed the communicator, and wiped
<br />
it off.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, WHAT DID YOU DO?!&quot;&gt;&gt;  Before Bahb could answer,
<br />
Jhosesophae intervened.  &lt;&lt;&quot;NEVER MIND!  Just beam everything directly to
<br />
sick bay, STAT!&quot;&gt;&gt;  Seconds later, all evidence that Jhosesophae ever came 
<br />
to that pond was gone, aside for some torn-up grass, was gone.
<br />
<br />Back on the ship, Jhosesophae was frantically applying some first aid to
<br />
the damaged cybunny.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, you better hope REAL HARD that was just a
<br />
stun ray.&quot;&gt;&gt; he cursed, as he got finished patching Bunnie up.  He then
<br />
rushed back to the replicator.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Okay, now what?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Place the crystals in the engine core, and I'll take care of the
<br />
rest.&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb noted.  Jhosesophae complied, sticking the two large crystals
<br />
next to the smaller crystal rods already present.  
<br />
<br />Bahb immediately set to its work.  It first cut out (using microblasts from
<br />
the weapons systems) the damaged communications array, so that there was a
<br />
somewhat jagged hole in the side of the ship.  Then, it created a energy 
<br />
pattern similar to a perfectly functioning communications array and placed 
<br />
it inside the transporter's energy buffer.  Finally, it teleported it over 
<br />
the hole in the hull that used to be the communications array.  After 
<br />
reinitializing the communications systems, and by bending several laws of
<br />
physics, the ship was yet again at 100%.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Repairs complete,&quot;&gt;&gt; spake Bahb, &lt;&lt;&quot;All systems at 100% efficiency.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Good,&quot;&gt;&gt; said Jhosesophae.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Now, I'm going to put on some clothing.  
<br />
Please keep our guest in REM sleep for the duration of my absence.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
The ship beeped in compliance as Jhosesophae began putting on a similar
<br />
outfit; and wondered how exactly to deal with this new snag in his plan.
<br />
Suddenly, he discovered another snag.  He was still bleeding profusely from
<br />
his legs and back.  While this didn't bother him as such, it was getting
<br />
all over the carpet.  So, he wandered back into sick bay, laid down on an
<br />
unoccupied slab, and activated the medical robot.  After he was bandaged
<br />
up, and the cuts and nicks welded shut, he dressed himself and checked on
<br />
the damaged cybunny's condition.  
<br />
<br />The sucking hole in her abdomen was healing nicely.  In about 5 minutes,
<br />
she'd be healed enough to release.  Then, he could get off this insane
<br />
rock, and back into space, where it was SAFE.  He was definitely not
<br />
recommending this place to anyone.  Suddenly, he sensed that she was
<br />
starting to awaken.  He activated the restraining field, and backed up a
<br />
few paces.  
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Bunnie slowly started to come out of her forced slumber.  Her head felt
<br />
like someone had used it to bowl a perfect game.  &quot;Ooh, muh head...&quot; she
<br />
groaned as she tried to sit up.  Suddenly, she felt the wound in her
<br />
stomach, winced, and laid back down again.  Sitting up was not something
<br />
she was going to do for a while.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Please don't do that.&quot; a synthesised voice uttered.
<br />
<br />&quot;Huh?&quot; Bunnie groaned, as she opened her eyes.
<br />
<br />The room was white.  White, and lit by some unknown source.  She was laying
<br />
on one of the many slabs that were around the room.  A single doorway lead
<br />
out directly in front of her.  A monitoring unit was to her left,
<br />
apparently keeping track of her life signs.  A tall, thin orange fox was
<br />
monitoring it.
<br />
<br />This obviously wasn't Robotropolis.  If it was, they'd finish her off
<br />
around now.  But if it wasn't Robotropolis, and it certainly wasn't
<br />
Knothole, where was she?  
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey,&quot; she muttered and waved her roboticized arm at the figure, &quot;you
<br />
there!&quot;  The figure either didn't hear her, or didn't understand her.
<br />
Jhosesophae heard the creature `making noise' at him, and said &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, 
<br />
does the creature appear to be sentinent?&quot;&gt;&gt;  Bunnie could only look
<br />
puzzled.  &lt;&lt;&quot;It appears so,&quot;&gt;&gt; Bahb said, &lt;&lt;&quot;Also, she was implanted with
<br />
cybernetic limbs that seem to be poisoning her.&quot;&gt;&gt;  Jhosesophae hmmed.
<br />
&lt;&lt;&quot;Well, we'll ask her about that, later.  For now, I need to know what
<br />
she's saying.  Please create a translation program, and prepare to upload
<br />
it to my crainal jack via the dataspike.&quot;&gt;&gt;  Bahb beeped in compliance, and
<br />
a wall in the back of the room suddenly grew a 4-inch long silver spike.
<br />
Bunnie watched as the figure walked over to the wall, turned around to have
<br />
his back to it, and shoved his skull up to its hilt.  A slight hum filled
<br />
the room as an electrical pulse entered the figure's skull.  A minute or
<br />
two later, he removed his skull from the spike (which retreated back into
<br />
the wall) with no ill effects.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; Jhosesophae said in proper Mobian, &quot;am I coherent to you now?&quot; 
<br />
Bunnie weakly nodded.  &quot;Good.  It's always kind of annoying when one lands
<br />
on a planet and doesn't know the language.&quot;  He smiled, and walked closer
<br />
to the discombobulated semi-metallic rabbit.  &quot;You took quite a shot there,
<br />
young female.  If you would have been any closer to my device when it went
<br />
off,&quot; His smile fluxuated slightly.  &quot;Well, let's just say having children
<br />
wouldn't be an option.&quot;  He perked up again.  &quot;Luckily for you, the blast
<br />
only shredded some of your abdomenic muscles, and didn't cut any deeper. 
<br />
The healing pad,&quot; He gestured at the white gauze-like pad taped to her
<br />
stomach. &quot;you have on should return you to normal in about 2 or 3 minutes.&quot;
<br />
Jhosesophae took a deep breath.  &quot;Okay, do you have any questions?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Who are you?  *WHAT* are you?  Why are you here?&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah,&quot; Jhosesophae said, &quot;the inquisitive type.  That sort of attitude gives
<br />
me hope for this planet.&quot;  He bowed.  &quot;I am Jhosesophae, formerly of the
<br />
planet Ur'thae.  Mentally, I am 18 years old.  Physically, I am 315.  You
<br />
see, I am a cybernetic device that is used as a manner of
<br />
immortality by containing the sum of my meat-brain's neural pathways
<br />
encrypted in my circuitry.  And I came here because my ship's
<br />
communications array was damaged.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bunnie blinked.  &quot;Could you explain that in more detail?&quot;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae shrugged.  &quot;As you wish...&quot;
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />&quot;About 300 years ago, there was a planet around a star...a very large
<br />
distance...away from here.  This planet was mainly populated by what you
<br />
call `foxes'.  They had achieved massive technological breakthroughs, such as
<br />
a propultion system than enabled them to travel faster than light,
<br />
artificial intelligences, and the ability to transfer energy into matter,
<br />
and matter into energy.&quot;  He let this sink in.  &quot;For a reference point, my 
<br />
world was about 100 years ahead of yours in technological prowess before 
<br />
whatever happened here happened.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;However, unlike your world, mine was not a peaceful one.  Wars raged
<br />
continuously over the most valuable technology on the planet; the neural
<br />
transfer device.  This device, when used in conjunction with a android body
<br />
with a neural net, could replicate the thought patterns of any individual
<br />
and transfer them into the android's form.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The main problem with this sort of technology was, of course, the
<br />
religious element.  Several of the settlements on the western continent
<br />
felt this technology stripped the soul from the essence, thus causing a
<br />
scream of psychic agony after transfer was complete.  This was,
<br />
hypothetically, causing a major disruption in the psychic plane, and
<br />
therefore had to be stopped before the wave started effecting the physical
<br />
plane.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Of course, very few individuals on the eastern continent, where my father
<br />
(the inventor of the process) and I lived, wanted to give up the chance to
<br />
further advance science by escaping the limitations of the flesh.  So, a
<br />
law was passed; those who wanted to become android versions of themselves
<br />
moved to the east, while those who did not moved to the west.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, you'd THINK this would solve the problem, but it didn't.  The
<br />
western continent simply became more infuriated at the people in the east,
<br />
because they were now isolated from them physically, psychologically, *and*
<br />
mentally.  Not only that, but the western continent was far more populous
<br />
and prosperous than the east.  The move only allowed the fanatical west to 
<br />
stew in their own juices.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;So, the spritual (and not surprisingly, political as well) leaders of 
<br />
the east decided their eternity could tolorate no more psychic warping, or
<br />
the spirit world was going to burst into this reality, or some horse-hockey
<br />
like that, and thus motivated the people to war against the west.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The wars raged on and off for years.  Major damage was done to both
<br />
continents.  Deforestation from napalm runs caused the environment to
<br />
slowly collapse, and beam weaponry destroyed most external structures.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Finally, the world could take no more.  The individuals in the east, being
<br />
purely organic, were dying from the inhospitable environment.  The west,
<br />
however, was only annoyed by it.  Finally, the east came to a decision.  
<br />
Since they could not, and would not, escape the very unfortunate
<br />
weaknesses of the flesh by cyborgization, they decided NOBODY would.  They
<br />
sabotaged the Central Crystal, which powered the entire planet, and the
<br />
planet was suddenly turned into a giant bomb.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;We had 1 hour to live.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;My father...&quot; He bowed his head slightly, took a breath, and continued. 
<br />
&quot;My father gave me the greatest gift he possibly could.  He had been
<br />
designing a special cyborg body for me, that would be stronger, faster,
<br />
heal quicker, and had a better sensory array than any other cyborg on 
<br />
Ur'thae.  He was intending to port my intelligence into it on my 21st
<br />
birthday.  However, due to the impending disaster, he grabbed me, knocked
<br />
me unconscious, and started the process.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I awoke 5 minutes before the planet exploded.  I was in this body, and I
<br />
was in a sort of a daze.  My father said to me, `Son, I cannot escape, but
<br />
you can.  Take this star vessel,' and he gestured to the saucer which you
<br />
and I now reside, `take this star vessel, and get far from this world.  Take
<br />
the knowledge of this planet with you, and teach the rest of our universe
<br />
of our mistakes.'  He embraced me, and whispered he loved me into my ear. 
<br />
Then, he forced me onto the ship, for I did not want to leave him to die by
<br />
himself, and I shot away from my home, my birthplace...my father...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I *wanted* to turn back, but he had programmed the ship not to.  By the
<br />
time I was able to regain control, there were two stars in my solar system
<br />
instead of one.  They had all been utterly destroyed because of a matter of
<br />
philosophy...&quot;
<br />
<br />He continued on, fighting back tears.  &quot;We were very close.  He and I
<br />
worked together on experiments since I was but a kit.  But he gave me the
<br />
great burden of sharing the knowledge, history, and culture of my world with
<br />
the universe, and the near-infinite time needed to do so.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;After a period of mourning, I programmed the ship to seek out any signals
<br />
from planets with intelligent life, set coordinates for them, and awaken me
<br />
when we arrived.  I then entered the ship's single cryogenic chamber, and
<br />
the reason my father could not go with me, and slept for over 300 years.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I awoke on this world just a day ago.  The only reason we stopped here was
<br />
because the communications array had failed.  Since we were not only forced
<br />
to land here, but this planet had large deposits of crystal, I went out to
<br />
mine some out of an underground cavern; and after I slayed a large metallic
<br />
octupus which tried to destroy me, I met with positive results.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Unfortunately, you must have discovered the small pool which I dove into
<br />
to acquire said crystal, with my small microcomputer defense mechanism
<br />
guarding it.  You must have kicked that boulder at it with
<br />
your...augmented...legs, and it fired upon it to defend itself. 
<br />
Unfortunately, it richoceted off the rock, and hit you.  I discovered you
<br />
lying there and teleported us and the crystals I had mined back to the
<br />
ship.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae calmed down considerably.  &quot;Now, I have repaired my ship, and 
<br />
I will leave your planet.  Now, I give you a choice.  Since you are
<br />
somewhat similar to myself, I will give you a chance that nobody else on
<br />
this world has.  You can travel the universe with me, because I have just
<br />
enough power left in the replicator to create another cryonic chamber, or
<br />
you can remain here.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae ceased speaking.  Bunnie blinked again.
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhh...&quot;
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae held up his hands.  &quot;Please, take your time in deciding.  I'm
<br />
in no particular rush.  Besides, you need to stay here just a bit longer,
<br />
because your stomach is still damaged.  I'll be back in a few minutes, and
<br />
you can tell me your answer then.&quot;  He smiled, and walked out of the room.
<br />
<br />Bunnie started mulling this over in her mind.  She could finally escape the
<br />
clutches of Robotnik.  Maybe this person could de-roboticize her.  And she
<br />
could do something no Mobian had done before; visit another planet.
<br />
<br />But, she remembered what Robotnik had done to her.  What he did to other 
<br />
people.  What he was doing to other people!  Then, she thought of the friends 
<br />
she'd leave behind.  Tails, Sonic, Sally and Rotor.  They were probably 
<br />
looking for her!  She had completely forgotten about that.  No, she could
<br />
NOT leave.  
<br />
<br />Jhosesophae walked back in.  He removed the bandage from her stomach. 
<br />
&quot;Well, that looks a LOT better now than it did before.&quot;  She looked down
<br />
and didn't even see a scar.  &quot;The muscle tissue will come back in a few
<br />
days.&quot; he said, and grinned at her again.  &quot;So, what do you say, uh....&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Bunnie.&quot; she said, &quot;Bunnie Rabbot.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah, Miss Rabbot.  Yes.  So, do you wish to travel the 12 Galaxies with me,
<br />
or do you wish to stay here?&quot;   
<br />
<br />&quot;I gotta stay 'ere, sugar.  I'm needed.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Needed?&quot; Jhosesophae said.  &quot;But this planet's been trashed.  Why would
<br />
anyone be needed here?&quot;
<br />
<br />And Bunnie told him why.  She explained what had happened on Mobius, and
<br />
what had happened to her.  She told him about the Freedom Fighters, and 
<br />
the fight against Robotnik.
<br />
<br />This struck a chord in Jhosesophae.  He lifted up Bunnie's robotic arm. 
<br />
&quot;So that...animal...did this to you?&quot;
<br />
<br />Bunnie nodded sadly.
<br />
<br />&quot;I understand why you cannot leave.  What is happening on this planet
<br />
should not be allowed to spread to other worlds.&quot;  He helped Bunnie to her
<br />
feet.  &quot;Come on, we're going to drop you off in style.&quot;
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Knothole was abuzz with activity.  The rumor was that Bunnie was somehow
<br />
captured by Robotnik via some sort of trap.  They had searched the forest
<br />
for her, after Tails had returned to Knothole and told them of the
<br />
mysterious crystal in the woods.  A search party was sent out to the site,
<br />
but they found nothing but some torn-up grass, and a few drops of oil and
<br />
blood floating in the water.  When they went down to the pool to take a
<br />
closer look, all they found was a trashed sentrybot that guarded a crystal
<br />
mine they had not known about before.  No Bunnie.  
<br />
<br />The search parties returned unsucessfully, and everyone was starting to
<br />
worry.  &quot;You think that a 'bot patrol got her, Sally?  There's been a lot
<br />
more of those lately...&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
<br />Sally shrugged.  &quot;I don't know, Sonic.  We can't find her anywhere.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic paced around impatiently.  &quot;Well, Sal,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm not gonna wait
<br />
around any longer.  I'm gonna hit the refinery and then check the prison
<br />
blocks for her.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally said, &quot;Sonic, please...&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic scowled.  &quot;You can't stop me now, Sal.  I've got my power ring, and
<br />
I'm gonna come back with Bunnie.  It's juice time!&quot;
<br />
<br />With a burst of speed, Sonic was nowhere in sight.  &quot;Good luck,&quot; Sally
<br />
whispered, her soul filled with dread.
<br />
<br />Suddenly, the sky began to darken.  People began rushing out of their huts,
<br />
and glancing to the sky.  An round shadow blocked out the sun that seemed to
<br />
be larger than the entire village.  Panic spread like wildfire.  Nobody
<br />
knew what the shadow was, nor if it was Robotnik.  Then, two sparkling 
<br />
outlines appeared in the center of Knothole.  Sally rushed out to meet
<br />
them, expecting the worst.
<br />
<br />After another few seconds, the outlines solidified into the forms of Bunnie
<br />
and Jhosesophae.  &quot;Hey there, Sally-girl!&quot; Bunnie shouted, and rushed over
<br />
toward Sally and gave her a big hug.  Jhosesophae just stood there.  Sally
<br />
had a puzzled look on her face. &quot;Umm, Bunnie...&quot;  Bunnie kept on talking. 
<br />
&quot;Boy, wait 'till I tell ya what hap'ened to ME today!&quot;  &quot;Bunnie...&quot;  &quot;I
<br />
tell ya, it'd make a pretty good novel.&quot;  &quot;Bunnie!&quot;  Bunnie snapped out of
<br />
her excited stupor.  &quot;What, Sally?&quot;  &quot;Who is that?&quot; Sally said, and pointed
<br />
at the tall, thin, orange vulpine.
<br />
<br />Bunnie walked over to Jhosesophae, took his hand, and led him over to the
<br />
Princess.  &quot;This is...uh, how do you pronounce it?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Jhosesophae.&quot; he said.  
<br />
<br />&quot;This is Joseph,&quot; Bunnie said, &quot;and he's come from, uh...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ur'thae.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Earth.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally shook the stranger's hand.  &quot;Hello, Joseph.&quot;  Jhosesophae 
<br />
shook back.  &quot;Hello, Sally.  Your planet is very...uh...nice.&quot;
<br />
<br />She smiled, and said &quot;Thank you, Joseph.  I'm afraid that it's not in the
<br />
best of conditions now, but it used to be quite beautiful.&quot;
<br />
<br />He smiled.  &quot;I'm sure it was, once.&quot;
<br />
<br />Then, Sally remembered Sonic's mission.  &quot;Bunnie, Sonic thinks you've been
<br />
captured by Robotnik!  He'll rush right into his clutches!  We've gotta
<br />
warn him somehow?&quot;
<br />
<br />Bunnie said, &quot;But how, sugar?  Nobody's faster than Sonic!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nobody, perhaps,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;but not nothing.&quot;  He looked up at his
<br />
ship.  He activated his communicator.  &lt;&lt;&quot;Bahb, three to beam up.&quot;&gt;&gt;  In a 
<br />
flash of a molecular limbo competition, they were gone.  The ship pulled 
<br />
away from Knothole, leaving the astonished citizens to gawk at the beauty 
<br />
of the vessel.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />&quot;This is incredible!&quot; yelled Sally as the ship rocketed through the upper
<br />
atmosphere, its cloak activated.  &quot;Your people had these sort of ships?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; he said, &quot;they did.  But this is just a mere two-seater.  Some of
<br />
the larger ships were quite glorious.&quot;
<br />
<br />They coasted above Robotropolis, completely unnoticed by the sensors of
<br />
Robotnik.  &quot;Now, let's see if we can find your friend.&quot;  He activated the
<br />
sensors, and scanned for organic life.  Sure enough, he detected a signal
<br />
by the only refinery left standing.  &quot;Your friend is going to get his butt
<br />
shot off,&quot; Joseph said, &quot;unless we give him a little bit of help.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Meanwhile, on the surface, Sonic was running for his life.  He had walked
<br />
right into a trap, alright.  There were more SWAT Bots there than he had
<br />
ever seen in his life.  He had to use his bombs to blast his way out of the
<br />
refinery, but didn't do much damage to it otherwise.  Now, he was dodging
<br />
lazer fire from every angle, and was probably going to meet his maker on
<br />
this one.  That really irritated him.  He'd never get to see Sally again,
<br />
he thought as he jumped behind a small wall.  And they'd gotten Bunnie as
<br />
well.  That REALLY steamed him.  Robotnik was not only going to get him,
<br />
but Bunnie as well.  He was getting ready to suck lazer when the firing
<br />
stopped.  
<br />
<br />He heard a figure walking toward him.  He turned around to face whatever
<br />
demise awaited him.  As he suspected, it was Robotnik.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, hedgehog,&quot; Robotnik growled, gloating, &quot;looks like you've run out of
<br />
luck.&quot;  He laughed.  &quot;You've got nowhere to run now, do you?  At last, I've
<br />
FINALLY got you right where I want you!&quot;  He waved his arms around to show
<br />
Sonic the hopelessness of his situation.  &quot;You move, they fire.  You don't
<br />
move, I fire.  You've lost, hedgehog!&quot;  He laughed again, louder, enjoying
<br />
his triumph.  &quot;I won't give you the honor of being robotized by your
<br />
uncle's device!  I'm just going to kill you right now, and I'm going to
<br />
make him carry your blackened, smashed carcass into the center of
<br />
Robotropolis, and hang it from the highest tower!&quot;  Laughing again, he 
<br />
raised his beam weapon pistol at Sonic's head.  &quot;Good-bye, hedgehog.&quot;  
<br />
<br />As if the hand of a god had swept Sonic up, he was suddenly surrounded by
<br />
an energy field, which deflected Robotnik's shot.  &quot;WHAT??!!  NOOO!!!!!!&quot;
<br />
he swore, as Sonic began to dematerialize.  &quot;You'll never destroy mee....&quot;
<br />
Sonic said as he disappeared into nothingness.  
<br />
<br />And then Robotnik was incapable of coherent speech for several hours
<br />
afterward.  
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />The ship slowly made its way back to the Great Forest, as Bunnie filled in
<br />
both Sally and Sonic about their new friend's life.  They cheered about
<br />
Sonic's safe return, and the mood was rather jovial.
<br />
<br />&quot;Even though we didn't get that last refinery destroyed,&quot; said Sonic, &quot;it
<br />
was still worth the power ring to throw Robotnik into such a huff.&quot;  He
<br />
giggled a little bit.  &quot;Man, I thought I was a goner.  Bet Butt-nik
<br />
thought so, too.  Boy, he's gotta be real mad.&quot;
<br />
<br />Then, the lights began to dim inside the ship.  &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Joseph, &quot;this
<br />
does not look good.  Bahb, what's wrong?&quot;  Bahb beeped, &quot;WARNING: Power 
<br />
levels at 25% and dropping.  Cloak dropping in 3 minutes.  Propultion 
<br />
deactivating in 5 minutes.&quot; 
<br />
<br />Joseph growled, &quot;Bahb, I thought you said that we'd have enough power to
<br />
repair the communications array and get off this planet.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bahb simply uttered, &quot;You didn't give any higher parameters than that,
<br />
Jhosesophae.  I used most of the ship's power in repairing the array.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph pounded the dashboard and swore.
<br />
<br />&quot;What does that mean?&quot; Sonic said.
<br />
<br />&quot;It means I'm going to be here for a while.&quot; said he.  &quot;Good thing my 
<br />
landing site is only a minute away.&quot;
<br />
<br />The ship slowly drifted over the site where he had parked last time, and
<br />
suddenly dropped right onto it.  The passengers were jostled, but not
<br />
seriously injured.  A collective groan went over the ship as they got out
<br />
of their seats and departed the ship.  
<br />
<br />Joseph looked at the ship.  &quot;Well, so much for my vacation at Alpha
<br />
Centauri.&quot;  
<br />
<br />It wasn't damaged as much as it was submerged.  The nose end of the ship
<br />
had sunk into the ground, leaving the rear sticking up at a 80 degree
<br />
angle.  The cloaking drones, however, had made the ship appear from the sky
<br />
to jut be an especially tall tree, surrounded by several smaller ones.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; Joseph sighed, &quot;You guys got any vacancies in that Knothole?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Why yes, we do.&quot; Sally said as they walked off toward Knothole, Sally
<br />
explaining several things to Joseph the whole time they walked away.
