Yes why...
<br />
The cartoon was great, nothing came close to it.
<br />
The first sesion was darker then the second.  Robotnik was dark and evil, 
<br />
very smart, just one problem the freedom fighters.  The cartoon went on freedom
<br />
fighters aganst robots.  Even through they could blow up a station or two
<br />
the problem still remained.  Swatbots where replaced as fast as they where
<br />
distroyed, bulidings took longer.  Some freedom fighters ever so often got
<br />
cault and roboticized.  It looks like there was little hope in this war.
<br />
The only thing that keep them from giving up was a hedghog named Sonic and a
<br />
Princess by his side named Sally.  They where the main driving force of this
<br />
battle, they would never give up.  They would die if needed to save Mobus.
<br />

<br />
Aside from that it was fun.  Bunnie a victum of an incomplete roboticization,
<br />
uses her disfigured body to fight along side the freedom fighters.
<br />
The first sesion has alot of Bunnie.  The second session very little she became
<br />
a player in the back ground.
<br />
Rotor uses his skill to help them in the both and second session equaly.
<br />
Antione a very usless wind bag who is used as comic relif most of the time.
<br />
Tails was keeped a bit in the back ground, because he was too young to fight
<br />
alond side Sonic.  The second session he does more.
<br />

<br />
The second session seem to focus on Sonic, Sally and a bit of Robotnik.
<br />
It was used as a history lession most of the time.
<br />
Robotnik has lost most of his self control in this session.  It appears that
<br />
Sonic and the freedom fights are realy starting to get on his nerves.
<br />

<br />
There is a big battle at the end, and it looks like Robotnik is gone for good.
<br />
Snively his helper takes over of whats left of Robotnik's empire.
<br />

<br />
The TV show get cut short of answering that burning question. WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?
<br />

<br />
And people wonder why people like us don't just give up on this hole Sonic
<br />
bussiness.
<br />

<br />
Because we don't want to.
<br />

<br />
Every wants to get into the story by creating storys.  Some write true Sonic
<br />
story others write there virsion.  Even some create storys that include them
<br />
selves.  I find that there is nothing wrong with this idea.
<br />

<br />
If you don't want to read them then don't.  I like a good story as much as every
<br />
one else.  Weather it be true Sonic or not.
<br />

<br />
My only wish is that ARCHIE improves SONIC storys.  After all TMNT is better
<br />
then the show ever was.  Why can't this happen with SONIC, what is holding
<br />
them back?  If they would only read Bookshires storys and page.  And use this
<br />
as a starting point for the comic.
<br />

<br />
The freedom fighters start chearing.  &quot;FOR A BETTER SONIC COMIC!&quot;
<br />

<br />
I feel better now thank you for listening.
<br />
