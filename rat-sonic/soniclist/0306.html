<br />
Well, I'll get a couple of comments done with first,
<br />
and then move on to my own two cents on a new game!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as the inter-species breeding thing is
<br />
concerned, the either-or approach is very common, but
<br />
not universal.  Note, for instance, Walt Kelly's use of
<br />
opossums with skunk tails and skunks with opossum tails
<br />
for the children of Pogo and Mamzelle Hepzibah.  In the
<br />
comic they seem to have established that different
<br />
species can breed, and their children will follow the
<br />
parent of the same sex (which boggles the mind from a
<br />
genetics standpoint, but so does interspecies breeding)
<br />
On the cartoon, though, they've NEVER confirmed this,
<br />
and the cartoon and the comic share little or no
<br />
continuity - I mean, just read the latest issue.  On
<br />
the other hand, Sally's father sure LOOKS like a fox,
<br />
doesn't he?  And Sally and Sonic are sort of engaged,
<br />
which would imply she thinks she can carry on the royal
<br />
bloodline with hedgehog genes.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Moebius's relationship to Earth, I'd like
<br />
to propose that the ONLY native intelligent species
<br />
seen so far are the dragons.  Please note the wildly
<br />
different biology, vaguely reptilian and marsupial at
<br />
the same time, and the only native animal we get to see
<br />
with any continuity are those little birds, which seem
<br />
to be constructed on roughly the same biological plan
<br />
as the dragons!  We've heard enough to know that the
<br />
other species have been there a good long time, at
<br />
least several centuries, but the whole place still
<br />
could have been a colony of Old Earth - which would
<br />
lead to interesting speculations about who they were
<br />
fighting the war with, hmmmm?  Not to mention the
<br />
singular rarity of humans.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to something perhaps even more interesting -
<br />
the request for game suggestions!  I have to echo just
<br />
about everybody else, and say that I would strongly
<br />
support more involvement of the other characters.  Not
<br />
necessarily actually PLAYED, because you would have a
<br />
great deal of difficulty playing Bunnie or Sally in the
<br />
same kind of level you'd play Sonic/Tails/Knuckles.
<br />
Still, I noted in Sonic 3 subtle level designs that
<br />
made areas where Tails could go and Sonic couldn't, and
<br />
which tended to channel them to parts of the game more
<br />
suited to their talents.  Something like that could be
<br />
employed.  Conversely, alternate levels where you have
<br />
to switch characters might be nice, or short animated
<br />
bits featuring the secondary characters of the cartoon.
<br />
Anything which really brings them into the story-line
<br />
will not only please die-hard Sonic fans, but will give
<br />
the games much-needed variety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, while I don't get to play the games as much
<br />
as I'd like, I've noticed a definite trend in level
<br />
construction.  In the first one, you frequently had to
<br />
charage through blindly at great speed, and unless you
<br />
knew exactly what was ahead, you were toast.  I've seen
<br />
them moving away from that, and would like to encourage
<br />
continuing this trend, please!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going back to another repeated request, varying
<br />
the plot line slightly for whatever character you use
<br />
would lend still more variety and flexibility to the
<br />
game.  Who wouldn't love to at least be ABLE to get
<br />
into a fight with Sonic?  Since multi-character seems
<br />
to be the trend, and a good one in my opinion, just
<br />
remember to treat all the other characters as equals to
<br />
Sonic, especially since I doubt most people will be
<br />
choosing the blue boy.  *I* always played Tails...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Temporarily Spouted Out,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouse
<br />

<br />
P.S.  I cannot for the LIFE of me get to the Sonic ftp
<br />
site!  How am I supposed to upload my weird pictures?
<br />
