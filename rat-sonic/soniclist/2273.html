Hi everybody! I'm abck, and have about 4 pages of things to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was off the wires(?) for two weeks (financial AOL problems
<br />
:'( ), and now have 111 messages (71 left to read). I am not
<br />
complaining, I actually expected more. I am going to answer all of
<br />
the messages for the first week in this letter, so if something was
<br />
answered last week, don't think of me as being annoying. Anywayz:
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;obsession, (which I probably am...) but I have been into Sonic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you'd call a &quot;classic fan&quot;... we all are... (I would think..) what
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what makes us this?  What obsession?  I don't want it to lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somewhere bad, and as much as I hate conformity, do any of you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;think this obsession with a make-believe world is normal?  Please
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;answer in a truthful and non-sarcastic tone.  If you have to flame
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me, don't.  It will waste &quot;precious bandwidth&quot; (I love that line)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and will make me sad.
</em><br />

<br />
I think that there is absolutely nothing wrong with being obsessed
<br />
(coming from a guy who cuts on Sonic's pictures from catalogs, and
<br />
pastes them on the wall :') ). Especially not with Sonic. I for one
<br />
am very tied up to the whole &quot;Mobian Theory&quot; (that's how I like to
<br />
describe it), because it is VERY similar to my own life, and has
<br />
brought me a lot of joy (a big group of people who I can talk to,
<br />
and who understand me, for one). Also, if you're not &quot;obsessed&quot;
<br />
with
<br />
something, then what do you do with your life, rot away in one
<br />
place doing absolutely nothing? Everyone needs a hobby. And to
<br />
close things up, my obsession has taught me something very
<br />
valuable: You are your own world, and what is outside of it, does
<br />
not necessarily have to affect it. (In other words, who cares about
<br />
what others think about you. You like what you like)
<br />

<br />
I hope that was not too much off topic, and that that helped a lot
<br />
of people feel really better.
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;did anyone else

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;receive my RPG? Is anyone listening to me? Here's something about

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sonic characters.....would anyone like their stats? But, really,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that if every character has 'super powers' of some sort,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it would ruin the game and the comic, and the TV show, and...well,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;you get the idea. Is there anyone who agrees with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;me.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    (I thought about this when someone mentioned Sally with super
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;speed) [I dead the thought!]
</em><br />

<br />
I got it,(have absolutely no idea what i am supposed to do with it,
<br />
but can ask someone to help me). On Sally's speed, a agree. I also
<br />
dead the thought (I actually get that). It's just that &quot;Brown
<br />
streak speeds by, Sally the Acorn...&quot; doesn't seem right.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    So I guess I should end this letter,

<br />
nice ending :')

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hello y'all...

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Did it occur to any of you that we may never know Princess Sally's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;real species?  Personally, I think she was adopted. I think she's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a cross between a squirrel and a chipmunk. What do you think?
</em><br />

<br />
The short, pointy tail, facial, and belly markings are very similar
<br />
to that of a chipmunk, but I really don't see what's so weird about
<br />
her father being a fox, and her mother being a squirrel. I think it
<br />
fits very well with super-sonic blue hedgehogs, ice-breathing
<br />
dragons, and the entire creature feature of the first season of
<br />
StH. (Just feeling left out and wanting to add something).
