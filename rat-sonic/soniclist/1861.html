Tails #2 [Jan, 1996]
<br />
&quot;Southern Crossover, Part 2&quot;
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone out there care to tell me how Tails could resume work
<br />
on his &quot;Tails To Astonish&quot; preadolescent fantasy/comic book when
<br />
the first installment was deep-sixed along with the Sea Fox in
<br />
Part 1?  You know that it's going to be a bumpy ride when you hit
<br />
a continuity error this early on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fluke approaches Downunda, and Tails flies off on his own,
<br />
little realizing that he's been picked up on Crocbot's radar.  As
<br />
a result, he runs into a welcoming committee of a pack of wing
<br />
dingoes.  After dodging a couple of them, Tails gets one of his
<br />
tails severely chomped and he crash-lands.  Before the wing
<br />
dingoes can finish him off, however, the Downunda Freedom
<br />
Fighters come to his rescue and drive off the pack.  The DFF
<br />
consists of: Guru Emu, a Sixties throwback; Wombat Stu (who for
<br />
some reason is lemon yellow); Duck &quot;Bill&quot;, an alleged platypus
<br />
who has the unfortunate luck of being drawn by Manak; Walt
<br />
Wallabee, a kangaroo who's the leader of the group; and Barby
<br />
Koala.  My dictionary defines a &quot;koala&quot; as a &quot;sluggish, tailless,
<br />
gray, furry arboreal marsupial&quot; with the characteristic large
<br />
nose used for sniffing out eucalyptus oil.  Barby, of course, is
<br />
white instead of gray, has an hourglass figure, and her nose is
<br />
one of those cute little numbers that can fit inside a bottlecap.
<br />
Somebody PLEASE give Manak a subscription to National Geographic
<br />
for Christmas!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But back to the plot.  One of the wing dingoes circles back
<br />
and kidnaps Wombat Stu.  This saves Crocbot's hide, since he
<br />
doesn't want to report that the pack was defeated by the DFF,
<br />
thereby causing Robotnik to cancel delivery of his bots and
<br />
supplies.  By displaying the captive Stu, Crocbot convinces
<br />
Robotnik that he's got the situation under control, so Robotnik
<br />
prepares to unload the blimp.  The DFF, however, decide to rescue
<br />
Stu rather than stop the blimp, so they take off for Crocbot's
<br />
headquarters (shaped like the Sydney Opera House).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Tails?  Walt dropped him off inside a crater
<br />
[major points to Gallagher for not taking him to an Ayers Rock
<br />
knockoff, which would have registered at 10 on the cliche meter].
<br />
He awakes to discover that not only is one of his tails out of
<br />
commission, he also has a sprained ankle and a broken arm.  As
<br />
banged up as he is, however, he follows the sound of a voice into
<br />
a cave.  There, in a totally gratuitous turn of the plot, he
<br />
encounters statues of the Ancient Walkers and is told that they
<br />
are his &quot;forebearers&quot; [the actual term is &quot;forebears&quot;, Mike, but
<br />
never mind].  He receives this news from Athair, an echidna who
<br />
looks like Knuckles except that he's brown, he wears rasta beads
<br />
in his dreads, and has a forehead that makes him look like he's
<br />
part Klingon.  Nice shower clogs, though.  He speaks of his blood
<br />
flowing through Knuckles' veins, inquires if Tails is &quot;the Chosen
<br />
One,&quot; and tells Tails &quot;you are mine...body and soul.&quot;  Tails is
<br />
terrified and the reader is totally confused.  To be continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de-Tails: a reply to one letter teases with a line about
<br />
stories concerning Tails' family and origins, along with upcoming
<br />
Bunnie stories in future Sonic issues.
