<br />
Historian's Note:
<br />

<br />
The events on Mobius take place a short time before Robotnik
<br />
developed Project Doomsday.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
500 million years ago, on the planet  Cassandra, a planet far
<br />
from Mobius....
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was near dawn in Pandora City, capital of the continent
<br />
Vulpecula in Cassandra's NW hemisphere.  The light from the star
<br />
Arcania gradually rose above the horizon with a yellow-red
<br />
glare, casting it's color over the city like a thick blanket. 
<br />
For the fox citizens that lived in the city and the rest of the
<br />
continent, it nearly time to go inside, away from the light that
<br />
they would otherwise be enjoying.  They knew that darkness was
<br />
their sole sanctuary now, for the ozone layer over Cassandra had
<br />
nearly been depleted.  The continent Vulpecula and the other
<br />
continent in the NE hemisphere,  Vulpes Prime, had been at war
<br />
for over 30 years.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Operation Merger, the unofficial name of the war, was one to
<br />
annihilate all prejudice between the Reds (red foxes on
<br />
Vulpecula) and the Grays (gray foxes on Vulpes Prime).  The
<br />
intended ultimate result was to end the prejudice by destroying
<br />
the other race.  The basic philosophy was:  no other race, no
<br />
hate-crimes.  Operation Merger started out in a rather primitive
<br />
fashion (compared to the technology that was available at the
<br />
time) with chemical weapons that wrecked havoc on the
<br />
atmosphere's ozone layer and caused global chaos.  Nearly all
<br />
the arable land on Cassandra was lost to Arcania's increased
<br />
radiation input to the planet's biosphere, leaving the people to
<br />
starve and the biologists mad at work to find ways to alter the
<br />
food crops for adaptation to the UV and IR rays.  About ten
<br />
years after the beginning of Operation Merger, the two
<br />
superpowers agreed to use only advanced technology in the war,
<br />
attempting to prevent any further losses.  But not even the
<br />
energy weapons could stop the chemical plague in the atmosphere.
<br />
&nbsp;Work had begun in the 12th year of the war to revitalize the
<br />
ozone layer, but to this day the procedures used had only been a
<br />
partial success.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, today was not only a day of retreat to the sheltered
<br />
coves.  It was also a day of hope and expectancy.  For this day
<br />
was one that would go down in history for the Reds and the
<br />
Grays.  The two superpowers agreed to end the war and start
<br />
working out their social differences in more peaceful ways. 
<br />
Prime Vixen Vala Andros of the Reds and Ambassador Falina Wren
<br />
of the Grays agreed to begin the major series of peace talks
<br />
after taking care of some unfinished business.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The unfinished business in their minds was the removal of the
<br />
ultimate weapon and the technical data required to construct and
<br />
maintain it from Cassandra.  The device would then be sent by an
<br />
automatic probe into Arcania.  The Red and Gray superpowers
<br />
worked together to remove this devastating monster from
<br />
Cassandra:  the Reds supplied the weapon and technological data
<br />
(it was their design), and the Grays supplied the ion drive
<br />
system for the probe.  To insure that the probe arrived to the
<br />
star, an auxiliary dimensional warp drive was installed by the
<br />
Reds.  After the procedure was complete, the peace talks would
<br />
begin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vala stood naked by the East Sector window, in her executive
<br />
habitation room of the Prime Lineage Home, located in the center
<br />
of Pandora City.  She scanned slowly over the visible areas that
<br />
she could see of Pandora City.  There wasn't much to see at this
<br />
hour of the day, since it was right before dawn and her windows
<br />
had the mandatory UV/IR filtering tint sheets on the window
<br />
interiors and exteriors, but the Prime Vixen saw enough to set
<br />
the mood for her day.  The eastern area of the city was nearly
<br />
halfway destroyed, since the major military technological
<br />
factories and bases were located there.  Reports indicated that
<br />
the attacks on those installations were conducted by a large
<br />
baryon particle weapons satellite from space.  It was a small
<br />
comfort that the weapons array was not aimed at any of the
<br />
civilian provinces.  So far.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'This war has been such a waste for both of our peoples,' Vala
<br />
thought to herself.  'It will take decades, maybe centuries at
<br />
least, to rebuild what we have both lost.  But it will be done.'
<br />
&nbsp;She put more determination into that last thought than she ever
<br />
thought she had under the circumstances, but it didn't hurt to
<br />
be hopeful in these trying times.  She was startled from the
<br />
universe of her thoughts to those of the physical universe by a
<br />
soft whistle.  It was from one of her personal communications
<br />
panels on the wall.  She walked over to it, noticing the video
<br />
display showed her faithful Prime Family Aide, Marcus Devrom. 
<br />
Vala was about to press the &quot;Return Access&quot; key;  however, after
<br />
taking stock of the situation she was currently in, she pressed
<br />
the &quot;Audio TX Only&quot; key.  It wasn't exactly good form to present
<br />
yourself to your aides when you weren't arrayed with the proper
<br />
attire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Marcus.  What is it?&quot; Vala tried to say in a calm,
<br />
composed voice, but failed at the attempt.  She knew that Marcus
<br />
would understand the reason she decided not to acknowledge him
<br />
with a video transmission from her node;  it wasn't the first
<br />
time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus, however, spoke with a calm voice and a straight face
<br />
that belied his humor in the situation.  &quot;Prime Vixen Vala, I
<br />
have received a message from Ambassador Falina Wren's aide.  The
<br />
Ambassador wishes to speak to you about Operation Excommunicate
<br />
and about  the preliminary plans for the peace conference.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well, then.  Send a message to Ambassador Wren's aide
<br />
that I will be ready to discuss the matters in about fifteen
<br />
minutes.&quot;  Vala managed to regain her composure that time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Your Honor.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video imager blacked out a second later.  Vala let out a
<br />
sigh of partial relief.  Trying to stay as confident and
<br />
commanding as possible isn't always easy under potentially
<br />
embarrassing conditions.  Not one to permanently harp on these
<br />
subject matters, Vala put the incident out of her mind and set
<br />
about making herself more acceptable for public view.  The
<br />
transmission would be broadcast on every conceivable
<br />
communications frequency available on Cassandra, both audio and
<br />
video.  Vala walked over to her wardrobe, searching for
<br />
something that would be &quot;ambassadorial&quot;, giving her people and
<br />
the Grays a feeling of power and reassurance.  Let's see:  the
<br />
black, red, green, violet, or do I need new clothes?  Good,
<br />
found the right dress.  Blue brings out my eye color.  And,
<br />
ouch! is hair cantankerous at times like these when you really
<br />
have to look your best.  Where are those medals?  Under the bed,
<br />
yes.  Now for the.....did I forget anything?  No.  The fifteen
<br />
minutes past faster than Vala had anticipated, but she was
<br />
prepared to speak to all the Cassandrans a few seconds before
<br />
one of her communications panels gave the long-awaited signal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marcus was visible again.  &quot;Your Honor, Ambassador Falina Wren
<br />
is now waiting for your reply.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vala pressed the &quot;Return Access&quot; key and said in her best Prime
<br />
Vixen voice, &quot;Reroute her transmission to this panel.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ambassador Falina Wren appeared on the video display about two
<br />
seconds later.  &quot;Greetings, Prime Vixen Vala Andros.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prime Vixen displayed her obligatory (but well-intended)
<br />
respect toward her counterpart.  &quot;Greetings Ambassador Falina
<br />
Wren.  I look forward to initiating the main peace conference
<br />
with you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As do I with you, Prime Vixen.  I have received a notice from
<br />
Operation Excommunicate Coordinate Operations Corps that the
<br />
weapon has been loaded onto the probe, and it's now in
<br />
geosynchronous orbit.  Are you prepared to commence your phase
<br />
of the operation?&quot;  Falina looked at Vala expectantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am prepared to do so,&quot; Vala decreed confidently.  &quot;Begin
<br />
Phase Two of Operation Excommunicate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase Two involved the probe's ion drive prestart and ignition.
<br />
&nbsp;Both ambassadors and their constituents watched their
<br />
vidscreens with an intensity tangible enough to be cut with a
<br />
phased neutron beam.  About three seconds later, a brief
<br />
discharge came from the drive exhaust.  The ion propulsion
<br />
system slowly accumulated the required energy to displace itself
<br />
from its orbital position with Cassandra.  Five long minutes
<br />
later, the probe had sufficient thrust to exit orbital space and
<br />
cross into interplanetary space in order to arrive at its
<br />
destination.  The planetary and orbital support crews made
<br />
exacting checks on the heading of the probe, for the fate of
<br />
Cassandra hinged on the fate of the probe.  The crews were
<br />
apparently in unanimous agreement that the probe was on course,
<br />
for it kept moving in the same direction, unaltered by external
<br />
command protocols.  A collective sigh of relief spread
<br />
throughout the Cassandran population.  This was the first
<br />
cooperative effort between the Reds and Grays for over 30 years,
<br />
and they have nearly accomplished a common goal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Prime Vixen,&quot; said Falina, &quot;up to now the operation has
<br />
been a success.  I think it's time to start considering what
<br />
terms we should discuss.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I agree,&quot; Vala voiced with determination.  &quot;First of all, I
<br />
wish to-&quot; Vala broke off her statement in midsentence, eyeing
<br />
the vidscreen with nervous and frightened intensity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with good reason.  For on the video displays accross
<br />
Cassandra, the probe's ion drive disengaged without
<br />
authorization from the support crews.  Three seconds later, the
<br />
dimensional warp nacelles had a more intense field of blue light
<br />
around them.  They flashed for a millisecond.  The probe was off
<br />
course, heading out of the solar system as fast as its dimension
<br />
warp propulsion system could take it.  On Cassandra and its
<br />
artificial satellites, jaws dropped with shock as the event took
<br />
place.  Shock was soon replaced by anger from the Grays.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falina displayed her anger, as well as the collective anger of
<br />
her constituents, toward Vala.  &quot;Vala!  Did you think that you
<br />
could insult my intelligence for so long?!  How would I know
<br />
that you were sending a long-range automatic probe to your
<br />
military space outposts?!  You have dishonored me, Vala!  Just
<br />
as you have dishonored yourself and your aristocratic people!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vala tried to get a few words in, to soothe Falina and explain
<br />
how it was all a mistake.  However, the communications channel
<br />
closed before anything could be said.  Vala took a last look at
<br />
the city with a dreadful resolve.  For she knew what would take
<br />
place in the next few seconds, and no power in the universe
<br />
could prevent it.  The ultimate reprisal had begun.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vala could almost hear the military satellites repositioning
<br />
their weapons at major cities and other sites on Cassandra. 
<br />
Phased neutron beams flashed through the vacuum of space to the
<br />
biosphere of the planet.  All the molecules in the cities and
<br />
surrounding areas were broken, their bonding shattered from
<br />
exposure to the intense neutron bombardment.  There was no time
<br />
for any last words or thoughts;  only time for destruction
<br />
throughout Cassandra.  In the exchange, a satellite
<br />
malfunctioned, and increased its weapons power.  The phaser
<br />
plowed through the crust, mantle, and finally the core.  This
<br />
disrupted the core's stability, sending massive quakes through
<br />
the planet.  The instability increased until the core
<br />
fragmented, sending hot metallic shrapnel through the overlying
<br />
layers.  What was a planet became a collection of planetesimals.
<br />
&nbsp;Cassandra and its inhabitants were destroyed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unknown to the Cassandrans, the accident on the probe was
<br />
caused by a disrupted power transfer from the ion drive system. 
<br />
Apparently, the construction crews underestimated the amount of
<br />
shielding required for the power transfer conduits.  One of the
<br />
ion drive conduits was too close to the warp drive power control
<br />
system.  When the conduit broke its shielding and arced, the
<br />
warp power system received an unintended power influx.  The
<br />
information came too late for the Cassandrans.  They were
<br />
extinct long before the cause was recovered from a place far
<br />
away, in both space and time.
<br />
