<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who would want to like on a ball of radioactive mud?  I've seen 
<br />
the results you get, trying something like that.  [MILITARY CLASSIFIED 
<br />
MATERIAL CENSORED HERE]  I don't think even Robotnik is _THAT_ stupid.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Is it me, or are Stealthbots unreliable? Anyone could work wonders with

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; them but Robotnik hardly uses them. Mass an army of them and as stated above, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nuke the world. (Ok, it's not that realistic, but it would be fun!)
</em><br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I'll buy this.  But when you mass an army of mechs, you got 
<br />
a support and supply problem that just won't quit.  Believe me, I've seen 
<br />
that as well. [MORE MILITARY CENSORSHIP HERE]
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhhh, sorry about the censorship, folks.  It isn't a joke.  There 
<br />
are _still_ a few things I'm not supposed to talk about, now that I'm out 
<br />
of the military.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, Robotnik, Snivley &amp; Co. seem to have a fair regard for 
<br />
their own skin.  Otherwise, they'd have started in on some of the more 
<br />
_exotic_ methods of warefare know to exist.  Nukes, chemicals, 
<br />
bio-warfare (ugh!), kinetic energy weapons, you name it.  Biowarfare 
<br />
would seem especially useful when you're fighting a different race 
<br />
altogether!  After all, any biologist/genetic engineer worth his salt 
<br />
would find it dead easy to come up with a new disease that avoided 
<br />
humans, but struck down other animals.  There are plenty of 
<br />
species-specific  plagues out there.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem with this, is that you get into the whole total war 
<br />
concept.  Dangerous.  Gets people _REALLY_ pissed.  Just ask the Nazi's.
<br />
Even _they_ were afraid of trying this for fear of retaliation.  It's all 
<br />
too easy to get out of control on _both_ sides.  Result?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One _dead_ and _sterile_ planet.  No good to either side.  
<br />
(that's assuming anyone's still left alive to be called the winner!)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trust me.  This is something I'm _ALL_ too familiar with.  You 
<br />
_really_ don't want my nightmares, folks.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I have to say that barring Robotnik/Snivley losing it 
<br />
completely, such weapons will likely remain unused.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Can you say `Balance of Terror', children?  Good.  I knew you could.)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guess that's all for now.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for listening....
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortuna bless and keep you.....
<br />
