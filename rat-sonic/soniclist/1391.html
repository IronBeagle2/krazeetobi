<br />
Well I found it.
<br />
&nbsp;Heres what I have so far:
<br />
<br />Prologue (continued from &quot;From Amy Rose, with Love)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry I slapped you Sonic.&quot; Sally started, &quot;I'm going out with 
<br />
Antoine now. He's a prince.
<br />
Anyway I think we should see other animals.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess so.&quot; Sonic said. A tear formed in his eye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Comeon my princez.&quot; Antoine said, he smiled.
<br />
Sally smiled. She took Antoines hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine....yes.&quot;Sally said, her words full of meaning.
<br />
Sonic glared at Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;Antoine smiled and slid the ring on Sally's hand.
<br />
They held hands as they walked off into the sunlight.
<br />
<br /><br />To Be Or Not To Be
<br />
Chapter One
<br />
<br />THE NEXT DAY.....
<br />
Antoine slid out of bed slowly.  Antoine opened his eyes,and saw 
<br />
Sonic. Sonic had an angry look on his face.  Antoine fell out of bed. 
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ECKKK!&quot; Antoine screamed.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Shut-up Ant. You want to wake everybody?!&quot; Sonic said. A red 
<br />
hand-print wear Princess
<br />
Sally slapped Sonic was still visable. Sonic wore  green boxers. He 
<br />
looked like he was angry, but the way he told Antoine to shut-up, it 
<br />
was clear that he was not mad at Antoine, he was mad at Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatz to youz want?&quot; Antoine said, wide awake now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's Tails! He's gone! I woulda' gone to someone else, but they 
<br />
went on a mission. The only ones left are supposed to be Bunnie, Amy-
<br />
Rose, and Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank-you so much for you're ze encoragement&quot; Antoine said. He 
<br />
then quickly got dressed and they went outside. &quot;I thought you 
<br />
mightze want to knowz that me and my mon-sherie,Sally iz ouw you zay, 
<br />
engaded. Pleasez excuse my french.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that a joke Antoine?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No joke,me an ze Sally iz en-&quot; Antoine started, but Sonic 
<br />
interupted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not that 'twain! The part about &quot;Excusing your french&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am ze french, am I not?&quot; Antoine said, now becoming confused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind Ant.&quot;
<br />
They walked towards Tails hut. When they got there, Sonic pointed out 
<br />
that there was no sign of struggle, and no sign that Tails had ran 
<br />
away. The only possible thing Tails could have done was followed the 
<br />
others on the mission. A top secret mission that is.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I zay we not worries about Tails. He's probally fine, no?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,trust me.&quot; 
<br />
<br />And thats what i have, I plan on having Sally Break up with Antoine, 
<br />
and tails is captured by robotnik.
<br />
Any Sugestions?
<br />
<br />thanks,
<br />
Bunnie Rabbot
<br />
