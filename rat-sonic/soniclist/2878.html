SONIC THE HEDGEHOG: INTERNET DENIZENS FOR A FREE MOBIUS
<br />
(sonic_at_lists.mv.net and sonic-digest)
<br />

<br />
Welcome to the only mailing lists that are Way Past Cool:  Sonic
<br />
the Hedgehog (tm) !  In these mailing lists, we discuss the comic
<br />
books and cartoons based on SEGA (tm)'s Sonic the Hedgehog, and
<br />
help free Mobius from the evil Dr. Robotnik.
<br />

<br />
The Sonic mailing list opened on 4 February 1995.  This is a medium-
<br />
volume list; you can normally expect to receive 8-15 list messages
<br />
per day (though variations can and do occur).
<br />

<br />
As a list subscriber, you are responsible for knowing and following
<br />
the rules and guidelines in this document.  Please read it carefully.
<br />

<br />
There are two versions of the Sonic mailing list.  One is &quot;live&quot;
<br />
and the other is a digest.  The digest version lets you get all of
<br />
the list messages in one convenient daily package.  You may change
<br />
your subscription status from &quot;live&quot; to digest or from digest to
<br />
&quot;live&quot; at any time.  If you decide to change your subscription status,
<br />
be sure that you unsubscribe from the version you don't want anymore,
<br />
or you will be subscribed to both versions and receive all messages
<br />
twice.  See &quot;How to Change Your Status&quot; below for more information.
<br />

<br />
In the event you should ever be roboticized, here is the correct
<br />
procedure for unsubscribing.  Send mail to majordomo_at_lists.mv.net.
<br />
In the text area, place &quot;unsubscribe sonic&quot; or &quot;unsubscribe
<br />
sonic-digest&quot; (without the quotes) on the first line and &quot;end&quot; (also
<br />
without the quotes) on the second line.  Leave the Subject: line
<br />
blank.  Allow 36 hours for your request to take effect.  DO NOT
<br />
SEND UNSUBSCRIBE REQUESTS TO THE POSTING ADDRESS.  THE SERVER WILL
<br />
NOT PROCESS REQUESTS SENT TO THE WRONG ADDRESS.
<br />

<br />
To post to the list, send your messages to sonic_at_lists.mv.net.
<br />
This address applies to both versions of the list.  Do not try to
<br />
send list messages to any other address, or your post may not go
<br />
through.  If you feel you must flame someone, please do so in e-mail
<br />
directly to that person.  Let's focus on fighting Robotnik rather than
<br />
each other.
<br />

<br />
You may post information and opinions related to the characters and
<br />
stories in the Sonic comics, cartoons, and fan fiction, as well as
<br />
information and opinions on the marketing of Sonic-related products.
<br />
You may post messages on the Sonic games to the extent that the focus
<br />
is on the Sonic/Mobius story and/or characters, and not on the games
<br />
themselves.  Asking why a game character rarely appears in the comics
<br />
is on-topic, but asking how to become &quot;Super Sonic&quot; in Sonic 3 is not.
<br />
If you are interested in the Sonic games too (or instead), please see
<br />
the &quot;Other Internet Resources&quot; section below.
<br />

<br />
Please do not post any of the following types of material: files,
<br />
commercial advertising, personal ads, or anything obscene.  If you do,
<br />
you are subject to immediate removal from the list and suspension or
<br />
termination of subscription privileges.  If in doubt, please contact
<br />
the list manager before posting.  Sonic-related fan fiction, images,
<br />
and sounds may be uploaded or e-mailed (See &quot;WWW/FTP Site&quot; below for
<br />
more information.)  Administrative and technical issues concerning
<br />
the list should also not be posted.  These messages should be sent
<br />
to sonic_at_rat.org or rat_at_rat&#46;<!--nospam-->org.
<br />

<br />
Some fans are creating a Sonic game playable on PC's.  Most discussions
<br />
concerning this game belong in the Twisted Mettle mailing list and NOT
<br />
the Sonic mailing list.  See &quot;Other Internet Resources&quot; below for
<br />
more information.
<br />

<br />
There are two FAQ's for this list.  You are encouraged to read them
<br />
before posting to the list.  They can both be retrieved from the Web
<br />
site as <a href="http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text">http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text</a> as faq-dd.txt and faq-jf.txt.
<br />
The Sonic Merchandise List can be found in the same directory.  See
<br />
&quot;WWW/FTP Site&quot; below for more information.
<br />

<br />
Not everyone has read all of the comic books and seen all of the
<br />
cartoons.  It's fine if you want to discuss major plot points or
<br />
a story ending, but please place a warning in your message so that
<br />
you won't spoil the story for those who haven't read/viewed it yet.
<br />

<br />
The lists are archived, and the current month's archive can be
<br />
retrieved from the mailing list software.  Older monthly archives can
<br />
be retrieved from the ftp site.  To retrieve the current month's
<br />
messages, send the command &quot;get sonic mail.txt&quot; (but without the
<br />
quotes) in the body of a mail message to majordomo_at_lists.mv.net; leave
<br />
the Subject: line blank.
<br />

<br />
How To Change Your Status
<br />
=========================
<br />
To change from &quot;live&quot; to digest, send this text inside a message to
<br />
majordomo_at_lists.mv.net:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe sonic-digest
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsubscribe sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end
<br />

<br />
To change from digest to &quot;live&quot;, send this text inside a message to
<br />
majordomo_at_lists.mv.net:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subscribe sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unsubscribe sonic-digest
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;end
<br />

<br />
Do not place any commands in the Subject line as majordomo will ignore
<br />
them.
<br />

<br />

<br />
WWW/FTP SITE
<br />
============
<br />
There is a companion Web and ftp site for this list.  Point your Web
<br />
browser to <a href="http://rat.org/pub/sonic/">http://rat.org/pub/sonic/</a> .  If you do not have Web access,
<br />
you may ftp to rat.org.  Please use the Web rather than ftp whenever
<br />
possible; it is faster and more convenient than plain ftp.  You will
<br />
find sounds, images, list archives, a variety of information, and more.
<br />
The directory containing &quot;adult&quot; images has been removed at Sega's
<br />
request.
<br />

<br />
You are welcome to upload files.  Most users will need to use regular
<br />
ftp but a few Web browsers are able to upload files.  For ftp or Web
<br />
uploads, connect to upload.rat.org and place your file in /incoming.
<br />
Stories should be sent by e-mail to bookshire_at_rat.org instead of being
<br />
uploaded to the server.  All uploads are subject to approval.  You may
<br />
announce on the list the uploading of your files after approval is given.
<br />

<br />
Users without Web or ftp access: Contributions may be sent by e-mail.
<br />
Fan fiction should be sent to bookshire_at_rat.org, and everything else
<br />
to rat_at_rat.org.  Existing files may be obtained via ftpmail.  Please
<br />
contact the list manager if you need help finding a ftpmail server.
<br />

<br />
Sega and Archie on the Sonic Mailing List
<br />
=========================================
<br />
We are very fortunate to have representatives of Sega and Archie Comics
<br />
as subscribers to the Sonic list.
<br />

<br />
Mike Wallis of Sega reads the list and sometimes posts Sega's viewpoints
<br />
on Sonic-related issues.
<br />

<br />
Editor Paul Castiglia and writer Ken Penders of Archie Comics are also
<br />
list subscribers.  You may send e-mail to them at benny7dude_at_aol.com
<br />
(Paul) and KenP7672_at_aol.com (Ken).  All messages will be read, but please
<br />
do not ask them to maintain regular correspondence.  Paul and Ken both
<br />
post to the list from time to time.
<br />

<br />
In general, you should NOT send Archie Comics any material for possible
<br />
use in their comics.  If you are a writer and are seriously interested
<br />
in pursuing this, please see <a href="http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text/archie-
">http://rat.org/pub/sonic/text/archie-
</a>
<br />
submission-guidelines.txt before you submit anything.
