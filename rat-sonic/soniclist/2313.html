Mr. OS/2 &lt;g&gt;, aka acme_at_use.usit.net, said:
<br />

<br />
[editage]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; ...branched out of that.  C'mon, Kris, Sonic was just a corporate sponsor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; before us fanfic people started giving him *soul*.  We have done most of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the maturation of the characters; yes, Archie and Fleetway have paved
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the way for us, but we continually take these characters to new levels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of...well, coolness on a monthly basis.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I, personally, am not all that intrested in exploring the more intimate 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;aspects of Sonic's and Sally's relationship.  I know there would likely 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be intimacy if they were live beings and chose to marry each other, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll let them enjoy their relationship in the privacy of their bedroom.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But my lack of interest does not give me the authority to make up someone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;else's mind on the subject.  It's OK to suggest an opinion to someone and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempt to sell them on the idea, but don't make their decision for them.
</em><br />

<br />
Exactly.  While I don't like some of the stories on Book's page,
<br />
I would be the first to stand up and yell my head off if Sega or anyone
<br />
else tried to get it removed on the basis of content.  It's just the way
<br />
I am, y'see.  I've said it once, and I'll say it again.  Censorship is bad.
<br />
Bad, bad, bad.  It's not good sense, good business, or psychologically
<br />
healthy to force someone to express their thoughts in a way that *you*
<br />
dictate.  After all, that's how they *win*...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think the original creators' wishes (if known, not second-guessed) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;should be respected, but you have to remember that the characters are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;out there&quot;.  If you're so attached to your character that you can't bear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the thought someone might use him/her/hir/it in a way other than what you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;intended, you should probably reconsider exposing that character to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;public.  You can't stop someone from thinking &quot;naughty&quot; thoughts about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your character (short of killing them) even if you could stop them from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;writing or drawing your character into compromising positions.
</em><br />

<br />
Another point I agree with.  Personally, the only things I have about
<br />
people utilizing Joseph in their fanfic are timeline gumups and
<br />
little errors in character development.  This is why I usually avoid
<br />
including my character in other people's writing...I've got Joseph's
<br />
adventures loosely planned out for the next several arcs, and I don't
<br />
like crossovers gumming up the works.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If Sonic's original creators were to speak up and tell us they are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;repulsed by the &quot;plain brown wrapper&quot; material, those of us who respect 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their original work need only gather 'round and support the writers and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;artists who also respect the creators' wishes and spurn those who don't.
</em><br />

<br />
I've got to write the fence a bit on this one.  For one thing, Sonic's
<br />
original creators, most likely a group of coders, have really left
<br />
the blue guy to blow around in the wind creatively for a good, long time.
<br />
Archie and Fleetway've had their way with him, as well as a goodly
<br />
number of fanfic writers.  It's like the American colonies after the
<br />
French and Indian War; the salutary neglect of the character (the colonies)
<br />
have given the stand-in creative influence (the people of the colonies) 
<br />
a feeling of psudocontrol (the desire for independence) over his destiny.  
<br />
Therefore, any attempt by the long-absent creators (the British Empire) 
<br />
at Sega to interfere with our setup would cause a big ol' fight.
<br />

<br />
And you know what?  Unless the story was personally offensive to myself,
<br />
I'd pass the ammunition.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; The people who made these characters are probably off working on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; &quot;Virtua Fighter II&quot; or something.  Cut us some slack.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You're probably right.  Sega isn't really developing Sonic et. al., and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;DIC certainly isn't.  Archie and Fleetway are, but only at a trickle with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a few issues per year and made none easier by difficult international 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;availability of both publishers' books.  Any new books from Troll 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Associates?  Not that I know of.  If the characters aren't developed  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;by &quot;official&quot; persons to satisfy the fans (read: market), someone is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;going to come along and do it -- and you can't depend upon third party 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;developers making the same decisions you would when implementing your 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characters.  The fan writers are sort of in the same league as those who 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;developed Linux, except they write for humans instead of a CPU chip.  And 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether it's Sonic or Unix, they're freely offering their time and effort 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to contribute to a universe (or operating system) not of their original 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;design.  I don't think AT&amp;T (the original creators of Unix) would agree 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;with everything that's been done in Linux  -- especially Linux's price 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(free).  The fan writers fill in the gaps left by the &quot;orginal&quot; sources 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;just as Linux opens Unix to those who don't want to (or can't) drop 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hundreds or thousands of dollars for a copy of &quot;real&quot; Unix; both fulfill 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a need that had not before been satisfied.
</em><br />

<br />
Just one word: Bingo.
<br />

<br />
Joe.
