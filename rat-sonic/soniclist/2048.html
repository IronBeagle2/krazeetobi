WARNING, MIGHT BE SOME SPOILERS
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About a week ago, I bought my first issue of Archie's Sonic the 
<br />
Hedgehog comic. The art is done by Ken Penders, so if you know this authors,
<br />
you know what to expect. In this issue, Jeofry St. John comes back and helps
<br />
Sally and Sonic defeat a new robot. The topic I want to discuss is Jeofry St.
<br />
John (or as my friend calls him &quot;That skunk dude&quot;). Was he so popular in
<br />
Sally's solo stories? He doesn't seem so much of a good character to me? And
<br />
who is he, anyway? 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the comic, there's a message to the reader, asking for a
<br />
vote on who should Sally go out with, Sonic, or Jeofry. I deffinetly think
<br />
Sonic. I wrote (but forgot if I sent :') ) them a letter saying that &quot;Why
<br />
doesn't Sally see who really loves her? All jeofry does is lipwrestle, and
<br />
flatter her with his words. Sonic, on the other hand, risks his life for
<br />
Sally everyday, and tries to do everything possible to keep her safe. My
<br />
friend (from now on Mike   P.S. I might be sending some of his messages later
<br />
on, but only as a last resort) thinks that &quot;That skunk dude&quot; should just go
<br />
and ever 
<br />
be used in these stories again. Any other opinions or explanations on this
<br />
character?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a knuckles solo story included in this comic. Since I missed
<br />
the earlier comics, could someone fill me in on what's going on?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third story in this comic is a Rotor solo story (You heard me
<br />
right). Mistakes, mistakes, mistakes! First of all, rotor goes to see his
<br />
family near the north pole. Acording to our fanfic, Knotholians had their
<br />
parents killed, roboticized, or sent through a hole in the wall. Rotor finds
<br />
(and was expecting to find) his whole family, along with the rest of the
<br />
group of walruses (I'd say all of them). Well, maybe Archie doesn't follow
<br />
our fanfic, so I wont send flames there. But, on page 5 of Rotor's story, I
<br />
found a very interesting  quote, &quot;It'll take too long to negotiate my sub
<br />
that far...&quot; (I carefully checked that to make it letter for letter). Now I
<br />
bet you don't see that everyday :')! How would you negotiate a sub?!
<br />
Personaly, I enjoy these little script mistakes, makes the comic a lot more
<br />
fun (Kind of a Where's Waldo type of thing). And the typo, naturally (or
<br />
logically) since it's a correctly spelled word, the word procecor skipped it,
<br />
and negotiated with a sub. Maybe the writer's words &quot;negotiate&quot; were put
<br />
there because the Sonic comic group is working on some big (or small) Sonic
<br />
project (although I think that the odds on this are very small).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also in Sonicgrams, there is a mentioning on Knuckles' miniseries #1
<br />
comming out in April (I am personally against Knuckles for some reason
<br />
&lt;probably due to loyalty to the Hedgehog&gt;), and a Sonic 48-page special,
<br />
Super Sonic VS. Hyper Knuckles coming out some time in the future (this
<br />
should be interesting). 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture of the front cover of the upcoming comic looks really good.
<br />
Maybe the #32 issue will be drawn by one of the more liked artists mentioned
<br />
on this list (Hope-Hope).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think that that's all I could say on this comic, except that
<br />
there is a &quot;Back Issue Order&quot; page that includes Sonic miniseries 1 and 3,
<br />
and Sonic &quot;In your face&quot; special. Also it has an order form for all of Tails
<br />
mini series (yes, all of them).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW - This comic is Not, I repeat NOT, filled up with slapstick. Maybe
<br />
one per story. So there's a good part about this comic too, for all of you
<br />
who are fed up with slapstick, or just want to read a normall, not so
<br />
childish, comic (Also, Jeofry plants one on Sally twice. Bad Boy). Maybe, as
<br />
someone mentioned it with a TMNT comic, the movement towards reality in Sonic
<br />
comics has begun. (double Hope-Hope).
