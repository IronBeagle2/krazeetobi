<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: drazen_at_andrews.edu (Dan Drazen)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Date: Tue, 28 Mar 1995 16:16:30 -0500 (EST)
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;To all those who have commented on Bloodlines:
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;[Note: if you haven't read the story yet, we're talking major spoilers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;coming up here]
</em><br />

<br />
Courtesy form-feed:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In all honesty, I had no idea that Bunnie and Sandy's relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     would take the turn it did when I started writing.  I had no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     intention of outing Bunnie or anyone else.  
</em><br />

<br />
I guess my basic reaction is that it's out of character (show reference: 
<br />
after Uncle Chuck's temporarily deroboticized, she tells Sally maybe she 
<br />
should &quot;take another look at that man...&quot;) _and_ it wasn't really necessary 
<br />
to the story line (IMVNSHO).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Obviously I wrote this before reading &quot;The Power of Love,&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     before Netscape was installed on my machine so I could discover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     how large a part Bunnie plays in the Mature [or should that be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     &quot;IMmature&quot;?] Fan Art section of Rotor's homepage.  
</em><br />

<br />
I don't want to know...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I was sort of afraid that some of her drooling fanboys would take umbrage.
</em><br />

<br />
Maybe I deserve that, although Babs Bunny will still be #1 :^)
<br />

<br />
Actually, I wasn't all that offended, probably because I've seen worse on 
<br />
alt.tv.tiny-toon (speaking as a survivor of the great TTBS flamewar...), 
<br />
plus I didn't get as attached to Bunnie as I did Babs, plus it had been a 
<br />
long day between Good Friday services and pretty much deciding I was fed up 
<br />
with my job enough to see if there are any better ones out there (anybody 
<br />
need a digital/analog circuit designer? :^)), so I was more or less too 
<br />
tired to get upset when I finally got around to reading it last night :^)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Hope nobody got too bummed by my allowing Queen Alicia to die.  
</em><br />

<br />
Well, it was pretty much expected, but it was still quite sad - especially 
<br />
Sally's reaction...  I'll confess I got a bit teary-eyed at it, which 
<br />
bothered me because it was yet another reminder that I am moved more by the 
<br />
suffering of imaginary characters than I am my fellow man.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Thanks for putting up with my ramblings.  
</em><br />

<br />
And mine :^)  I meant none of the above criticism personally, nor the 
<br />
following:  I guess I'm a bit disappointed that with the exception of 
<br />
&quot;The Power of Love&quot;, all of the fan-fic so far has more or less been on the 
<br />
grim side (especially the latest stuff with Packbell).  While I admit I do 
<br />
like the dark theme of the Sat. AM show itself, at least most of the 
<br />
episodes have enough hope in them that this tempers things a bit.  I don't 
<br />
seem to see this in the fan-fic.  But far be it from me to tell people what 
<br />
to write - if I decide that it's not worth discussing the comics (that and 
<br />
the fan-fic are about all that's left to talk about), I can always 
<br />
unsubscribe...
<br />

<br />
PS to my non-list CCers: if you want a copy of the story, e-mail me -
<br />
I still have it for now.  I haven't decided how long or if I'll keep it 
<br />
though...
<br />

<br />
BTW, Happy Easter everybody!  I pray that those of you who don't know 
<br />
Christ as your personal Savior will take a moment to consider His claims 
<br />
and what He has to offer; also, if you were to die tonight and stand before 
<br />
God and He asks you &quot;Why should I let you into My heaven?&quot;, what answer 
<br />
would you give Him?
<br />

<br />
Sermon mode OFF,
<br />
