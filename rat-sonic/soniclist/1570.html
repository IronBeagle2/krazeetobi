&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Author: Pat Carson Jr.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the Keld'yrian base known as Haven, hidden somewhere on Mobius,
<br />
the halls were quiet... Or they would seem so to those who couldn't hear
<br />
thoughts... (Translated from Keldii)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Ok, what's the status?&gt;*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Not good... Robotnik has the Ry'den Star and is en route to
<br />
Robotropolis even as we speak&gt;.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Ack... Glad he doesn't know how to use it...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;That's true now, perhaps, but I doubt he will remain ignorant of its
<br />
usage for long.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Yup. And when he _does_ figure out how to use it, both we, and the
<br />
remaining people of Mobius are in big trouble.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;I think &quot;Not good&quot; is one heck of an understatement...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Gods, this is my fault... If we had stayed there to protect it...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;...then you'd both be _dead_.  As soon as Robotnik's patrol picked up
<br />
the energy signature, the amount of robots he brought to the subbase would
<br />
have easily overwhelmed you. Stop blaming yourself for this.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;You're lucky you managed to self-destruct the other equipment there
<br />
in time...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;What I wanna know is, HOW did he pick up the energy signature? We had
<br />
the subbase well cloaked from whatever sensors Mobius could produce...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;I've got my suspicions...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Yes, but we'll need proof for those. In the meantime, we need to find
<br />
a way to relieve him of the Ry'den Star before it's too late.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Can't we just go in and take it?&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;No, Darius. Too risky. We may be able to teleport in there, but we
<br />
can't teleport out of there with it, and he's most certainly not going to
<br />
let us destroy it.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Ya, too many of us there equals too many chances of him getting a
<br />
hold of one or two of us, spelling _big_ trouble for Mobius.&gt;* 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;And just one or two of us going in by ourselves would be just plain 
<br />
stupid...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;I know the Freedom Fighters would most certainly be willing to go in
<br />
there, if they knew what was at stake...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Yes, they would... Perhaps one of us should go to them and inform
<br />
them of the threat, and maybe even assist them.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Hmm.. Perhaps that is the solution then...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;We're gonna be bending the heck out of Rule #3 by doing this...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Agreed, but given the circumstances, I'd say we're well justified in
<br />
doing all the bending we can..&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Yup.&gt;*  *&lt;Agreed.&gt;*  *&lt;She's right.&gt;*  *&lt;Sounds good to me...&gt;*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Well, then it's settled.  Which group should we contact?&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;The group at Knothole is the closest group to Robotropolis, and
<br />
Princess Sally Acorn resides there... I'd say them.&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&lt;Vision! You've been observing that group for quite some time. 
<br />
Perhaps you should volunteer for this?&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision just grinned and stood up from his chair.  *&lt;I thought you'd
<br />
never ask...&gt;*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the great forest, at a waterfall in Knothole Village, Princess 
<br />
Sally was resting against a nearby log watching the clear water flow by,
<br />
Nicole closed shut by her side.  She liked this spot; It was a beautiful
<br />
location, untouched by Robotnik's pollution and dreariness.  It reminded
<br />
her of what most of Mobius looked like before Robotnik staged his conquest
<br />
of the planet.  It was a nice place to relax and reminisce...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was startled out of her rest, however, by a sudden whooshing sound
<br />
and rush of air.  She quickly turned her head to see a familiar blue
<br />
hedgehog standing beside her.  &quot;Yo, Sal! News flash from Uncle Chuck!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally caught her breath.  &quot;Sonic, you scared me... Can't you announce
<br />
yourself without making others jump 10' feet?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, c'mon, Sal,&quot; Sonic replied with his familiar smirk.  &quot;You know
<br />
me.  I'm just too cool to not make an impression.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rolled her eyes upward. &quot;Whatever, Sonic... What news did
<br />
Charles have for us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic hopped up and sat on the log.  &quot;Robuttnik came across some
<br />
abandoned base near the Great Unknown.  Everything was trashed there except
<br />
for this big, weird crystal, which he brought back to Robotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This wasn't a Freedom Fighter base, was it?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic shook his head. &quot;Nope. No one knows _who_ it belonged to.  But
<br />
they _do_ know that the crystal holds a way serious amount of power.
<br />
Enough juice to light up Robotropolis for years.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh...&quot; Sally gasped.  &quot;Sonic, he could also use something
<br />
like that as a powerful weapon!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh-uh,&quot; said Sonic, shaking his head again. &quot;Ol' Robuttnik can't
<br />
figure out how to draw the juice out of it.  The fat man hasn't got a clue
<br />
how to use it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally frowned. &quot;That doesn't mean he won't know how to use it for
<br />
long, Sonic...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked. &quot;No problemo, Sal, we'll just have to take away his
<br />
little crystal whatchamacallit before he...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Ry'den Star.*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah! Ridden star!&quot; Sonic then blinked. &quot;Heyyy... Who said that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally got up, looking a bit alarmed. &quot;Sonic... I don't think anyone
<br />
_said_ that... It's almost as if it was...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Thought to you?*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gasped, and Sonic jumped off the log, looking around quickly.
<br />
&quot;Awright, that's it! Who's there?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rustling sound from behind caught Sonic's attention, and he spun
<br />
around to see a bush shaking a bit, then remaining still.  &quot;Ok, come outta
<br />
that bush and show yourself!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Can't do that, blue boy...*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic frowned annoyedly. &quot;And just why not?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*'Cause I _am_ the bush.*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic folded his arms, looking even more annoyed. &quot;Yeah, right! And
<br />
_I'm_ the queen of the prom!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If you say so, your majesty...*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next completely shocked Sonic and Sally both.  The bush
<br />
glowed brightly, then almost seemed to melt, reshaping itself into
<br />
something else rapidly.  When the glow faded, it was no longer a bush, but
<br />
a grinning red fox holding his hands behind his back.  He had a tuft of
<br />
hair over his forehead, and his back hair was tied into a short ponytail.
<br />
He also wore an odd gold amulet around his neck. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked completely flabbergasted. &quot;HUH?! What th'...?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked equally as stunned.  _No_ species could change shape like
<br />
that... at least no species from Mobius. &quot;Wh-Who _are_ you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox smiled and walked forward a bit. &quot;The name's Vision,
<br />
Keld'yrian shapeshifter and Lord of PEZ, at yer service...&quot; He said with a
<br />
bow.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And _you_ two,&quot; He continued, rising back up and grinning, &quot;are
<br />
_just_ the Freedom Fighters I've been looking for...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sonic blinked and looked at each other confusedly, then back
<br />
at Vision. &quot;For us??&quot; they both said in unison.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Absoposilutely!&quot; Vision replied, as he walked up to the log and
<br />
leaned against it.  He pointed at Sonic. &quot;You're Sonic Hedgehog, leader of
<br />
the Freedom Fighters, and the biggest thorn in Crazy Ivo's bloated side.
<br />
We've enjoyed watching you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked again, then smirked.  &quot;See, Sal? Told ya I had a fan
<br />
club.&quot;  Sally rolled her eyes at that comment.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision chuckled, then turned to Sally.  &quot;And you are Princess Sally
<br />
Alicia, of the house of Acorn.  I know you believe that titles are
<br />
meaningless out here in the woods, but you are most certainly more
<br />
qualified to lead this world than Crazy Ivo ever will be.  And far better
<br />
looking, in my humble opinion.&quot;  With that, he kissed her hand cordially.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blushed at the compliment. &quot;Oh.. Thank you...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ahem..&quot; Sonic interrupted, folding his arms and tapping his foot.
<br />
&quot;How come you know so much about us, an' we know nothing about you? Like,
<br />
what you are, what you're doing here, and why you where looking for _us_?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally bristled a little at Sonic's callousness.  &quot;Sonic, please...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision, however, waved it off.  &quot;All perfectly good questions, my
<br />
dear.  To answer them, lemme spin ya a little yarn about us...&quot;  He then
<br />
sat down, leaned his back against the log, and began...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I, and the thirty others of my kind here on Mobius, come from a
<br />
world we call Keld'yr.  Our people believe in the sanctity of Life and
<br />
Freedom, and we like to make friends with other worlds that share that
<br />
belief.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We noticed yer world about thirteen years ago, and listened in on
<br />
yer transmissions for a few months, to get a small idea of what you were
<br />
like.  We became interested, so a small handful of us, including yours
<br />
truly, quietly set ourselves up here, to observe you more closely, first by
<br />
simply watching everyday events, then after about a year, we began to
<br />
interact with you, using our ability to shapeshift to pose as one of yer
<br />
kind.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We watched you for about a year, all through the tail end of the
<br />
Great War and past.  We watched the King, your father, Sally, bring an end
<br />
to the war and order all the warbots dismantled.  He wanted to bring about
<br />
a new era of peace, where people are ruled by common sense and compassion,
<br />
and most Mobians were ready to embrace that change.  That was the main
<br />
reason we finally decided to make a formal contact with Mobius, first with
<br />
the King, then hopefully with all of you.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sadly, tho, it was only three days after we that decision when Crazy
<br />
Ivo had the unmitigated audacity to make his move towards conquering the
<br />
planet.  We were as surprised as everyone else was that this happened, and
<br />
were lucky to get all of us back to Haven, our main base here...&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision looked away, out in the distance, and sighed.  &quot;A lot of us
<br />
made friends amongst you, only to see most of them get carted away to be
<br />
roboticized...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic interrupted.  &quot;Yeah, well, ya coulda' _helped_ us, ya know.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision pre-empted another admonishment from Sally by changing shape
<br />
again, to face the two, becoming an orange furred cat.  &quot;A lot of us
<br />
would've, blue boy, were it not for our Third Law.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked. &quot;Third Law?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Third Law,&quot; Vision replied, raising his index finger, &quot;which
<br />
states: We shall not involve ourselves in the internal politics or
<br />
conflicts of any world other than our own.  We almost got into a very nasty
<br />
war by doing just that, and vowed never to do it again.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmph.&quot; Sonic crossed his arms. &quot;How conveeenient...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally glared at Sonic. &quot;Sonic, stop it.  It makes perfect sense for
<br />
them to have such a law.&quot;  She then turned back to Vision, ignoring a
<br />
&quot;yeah, right.&quot; from Sonic. &quot;Please, continue.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision smiled. &quot;Thank you. Anywayyy... Soon after the takeover, we
<br />
noticed the activity of small resistance groups scattered about Mobius.
<br />
We decided to keep secretly observing, always adhering to The Third Law.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Recently, however, Crazy Ivo has made a small amount of our
<br />
involvement necessary, by taking something that belongs to us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean this 'Ry'den Star'?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vision nodded.  &quot;Ry'den Stars are the power source for our main base
<br />
and sub-bases.  They hold a lot of power within them, and are usually quite
<br />
stable, tho you wouldn't want one of your power stones anywhere near one.
<br />
Crazy Ivo somehow picked up the energy signature of the one at our sub-base
<br />
near The Great Unknown, despite the fact that we had it cloaked, and
<br />
stormed in.  The two of us stationed there were lucky enough to
<br />
self-destruct the rest of our equipment and get out, but now he's got it.
<br />
Your fears of what will happen when he figures out how to use it are well
<br />
founded, Sally..&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded and crossed her arms worriedly. &quot;We can't let him keep
<br />
this thing...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah.. this is major bad news.&quot; Sonic added. He then turned to
<br />
Vision.  &quot;Hey, if you're so advanced, how come ya just can't take it away
<br />
from Robuttnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, lessee..&quot; Vision replied.  &quot;We can't teleport it out.  Trying
<br />
to teleport a Ry'den Star is a _baaad_ idea.  To send just one of us in
<br />
there is just plain stupid, and if a group of us goes, that increases the
<br />
chance of one of us getting caught, and if _that_ happens...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally interrupted.  &quot;Robotnik could become so powerful that we _all_
<br />
would be doomed...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Precisely,&quot; said Vision.  &quot;We finally decided to send someone, namely
<br />
myself, to warn you of the threat.  I would also like to assist you in this
<br />
endeavor.  If possible, we'd like our Ry'den Star back with us.  If not,
<br />
I'll be responsible for seeing that it's destroyed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Either way, it's out of Robotnik's hands...&quot; Sally said
<br />
thoughtfully.  &quot;Hmm... I think we could most definitely use your help.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked, then shook his head. &quot;Whoa! Time out!&quot; he pulled Sally
<br />
aside and said, &quot;I don't trust this guy, Sal, or these Keld'yrians... He
<br />
could be working for Robuttnik, or they all could be trying to take over
<br />
Mobius for themselves!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed, and said, &quot;Sonic, that's absurd.  He obviously knows
<br />
where Knothole is.  If he was on Robotnik's side, we wouldn't be standing
<br />
here right now.  And if the Keld'yrians wanted to invade and overtake
<br />
Mobius, don't you think they would have done that thirteen years ago??&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But..&quot; Sonic tried to get a word in, but Sally stopped him. &quot;Sonic,
<br />
he knows a lot more about that Ry'den Star Robotnik has, and he's confirmed
<br />
my fears about how serious a threat this is. We _need_ his help.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic thought to himself, then grumbled. &quot;Oh, alright, Sal... But I'm
<br />
keepin' an eye on this guy!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever, Sonic..&quot; Sally said, then walked back to the log.  &quot;Vision,
<br />
we welcome any help you can give us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Keul!&quot; Vision said, hopping up. &quot;We should have a team assembled
<br />
ASAP.  I don't think Crazy Ivo's gonna be in the dark about how to play
<br />
with the toy he has for long.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded, and the three of them started towards Knothole's hub,
<br />
Vision trailing behind the other two, occasionally commenting on how
<br />
fascinating the foliage looked.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's amazing...&quot; Sally told Sonic, &quot;That these Keld'yrians have been
<br />
watching us for so long, and we had no idea that they even existed...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well...&quot; Sonic replied, &quot;I'm not sure I like...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIC!!&quot; Sonic was interrupted by a familiar two-tailed fox bounding
<br />
up and hugging him.  &quot;Hey, Sonic! Hi, Aunt Sally!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey there, little bro'!&quot; Sonic hugged tails back. &quot;How's it goin'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Goin' Great, Sonic!  I...&quot; Tails then noticed Vision approaching and
<br />
said, &quot;Hey, who's... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!&quot;
<br />
He immediately hid behind Sonic from the shapeshifter, trembling.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blinked at Tails' odd behavior, and Vision raised an eyebrow,
<br />
saying, &quot;Shyness?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic glanced at Vision, then looked back down at Tails.  &quot;What's
<br />
wrong, Tails??&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails shakily pointed at the amulet Vision was wearing.  &quot;S-s-sonic!
<br />
Th-that's the s-same medallion the Headless Gopher dropped where we were
<br />
camping!!!&quot;
