<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Actually, videogame systems are much more stable than PC's. A videogame 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system takes on average 5 years to become phased out, a new PC does this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in about 6 months. Not to mention that a computer is a serious investment 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for some people, if all they want to do is play games, what can beat 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;paying $90 for a system and then around $50 for games, not to mention 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that a videogame system is much easier to use and doesn't require its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;user to understand OS's.&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually, it doesn't matter which brand PC you buy, as they will all run the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;same software (unless it's a MAC). So if you buy a game for a PC, chances are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the only changes you'll require is a possible memory upgrade. Or if it plays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on WIndows instead of DOS. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, with gaming systems, you have the Genesis, the Sega CD, Game Gear,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;32X , Saturn, Super NES, Game Boy, Lynx, 3DO, Sony Playstation, and many
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; others that I can't think of 'cause I'm too busy to follow them all to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;choose from. You pick a system because you like the games, then a new system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comes out and you have to make a choice because neither system's games are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;compatible with each other. On top of that, there's the accessories that are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;available for each system, plus buying or renting the games. So gaming is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a cheap proposition by any stretch of the imagination. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kiken then goes on:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;The average age of a US Genesis 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;owner is 18, and the average age of a US Sega CD owner is 21, basically 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;college students like myself. Those with lots of money to burn. But 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;again, its SOA's white-coats who think we want games like Corpse Killer, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead of our &quot;childish&quot; Sonic games. This is where the problem comes in.&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know where you get your information regarding the average age of a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;video game consumer, but I'm speaking from first hand knowledge both as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parent and someone who used to work in retail selling video game systems that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the average purchaser was more often than not a parent who bought a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for their kids whether they were in grade school or college. Were college
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;kids the biggest customers? No way. High school kids and younger with their
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parents far outnumbered college kids when a new game was released on sale,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whether it was SONIC 3 or MORTAL KOMBAT or NHL HOCKEY.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;When you say average age, you have to account for people under and over the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;average and that's where you get the number from. The amount of people in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their 30's buying for their kids 10 and under far exceeds those 19 - 23 in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;college who are into video games. And if you were to check with any licensee
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of SONIC products such as sneakers, comics, cartoon series, t-shirts, books,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;toys and so on, they would tell you that there's more money to be made from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;parents buying for their kids than from college students. This is not meant
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;as a knock on college students. This is a business fact. That's why you see
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;McDonald's renovating their restaurants with those jungle gyms, in order to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;get the families in to spend more with them. You think TV would worry about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;getting it's act together if they didn't have to? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Enjoy the blue-critter and playing the games and reading the books. We who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;produce the work don't think we're doing anything &quot;childish&quot;. What we do is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;try to produce something that appeals to everyone, something that's extremely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;difficult to do. It's much easier to write a story is you have a specific
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;audience that you aim for. If I wrote for just college students, my stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be wildly different. Instead, I have to think more in trying to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;across something the kids will think is funny while the adults are catching
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on to the stuff between the lines.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Believe me, from my vantage point working on Archie's SONIC series, I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;convinced SEGA has a strong interest in keeping SONIC at the forefront with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;SEGA customers. If SONIC'S star fades, it won't be because they didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;promote him.
