<br />
I've not seen all that many pics from the defunct perv directory, but
<br />
those I have seen are a lot less raunchier than some of the TTBS images
<br />
I've seen.  Warner Bros. and Time-Warner seem to be a lot more tolerant of
<br />
such uses of their characters; after the &quot;Please, Please, Please, Get a
<br />
Life&quot; short on &quot;Animaniacs&quot; (including the Minerva poster), I'd say it's a
<br />
near certainty they are aware of all the TTBS and TTLS pics and stories
<br />
out there.  The enormous financial resources of Time Warner could use the
<br />
court system to wipe out places like the acme and TTA Web pages almost as
<br />
fast as Sonic can get from the huts to the power ring pool. 
<br />

<br />
Of course, Sega is a different company with its own agenda, and we should 
<br />
at least be thankful they aren't as anti-'net as I've heard Paramount and 
<br />
Disney are.
<br />

<br />
While walking to work yesterday, I came up with ideas that, if 
<br />
implemented, could potentially make Sega's PR staff work overtime.  If 
<br />
removal of the porn and violent pics is the end of the matter, these 
<br />
ideas will be discarded and never divulged.  There is a certain alt.* 
<br />
newsgroup that helps bring forth many interesting ideas (&quot;2600&quot; is not a 
<br />
part of its name).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I had to ask 3 times for an offical email. But they were concerned that &quot;Sega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be made out to be a bully&quot;. And I told her that if she was going to ask
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; me to take it down, she would have to ask me to take it down. There is no way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I was going to take it down if they were not going to even ask me officially. 
</em><br />

<br />
Can't live with the consequences of their own decision, eh?  If they want 
<br />
to play hardball with Sonic fans who are also their clientele, they'll 
<br />
just have to let the chips fall where they may.  If you don't want to be 
<br />
thought of as a bully, don't be one.  Amazing that such a simple concept 
<br />
is so difficult to grasp.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (Think about it.  This is a 1st Amendment issue.  The EFF would get behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; us all the way if we could just get their attention...)
</em><br />

<br />
Not First Ammendment.  It's not Congress trying to stop our Sonic fun.. yet.
<br />
It's a matter of Title 17 United States Code (Copyright Act of 1976).  
<br />
Though the 1976 law provides for new technologies in a way much superior 
<br />
than its predecessors, the legislators of the time could not have 
<br />
anticipated the advent of the current state of personal computer 
<br />
technology (at least it occurring so relatively soon), and the current 
<br />
code does not adequately address matters concerning 'net use of protected 
<br />
material.  We are at the mercies of the vagaries of court decisions until 
<br />
the 1976 law is superseded, and I doubt Congress will get around to that 
<br />
any time soon.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't know enough about the legal issues.
</em><br />

<br />
I have had a course in copyright law and another in contract law for the 
<br />
music industry, but these aren't enough for me to be pro se in court and 
<br />
still be able to stand my ground.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But aside from that, I'd rather not get on Sega's bad side unless it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; necessary. If they tell me to take down the regular pics, I will have to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on their bad side. 
</em><br />

<br />
We'll just have to wait and see, and hope the porn/violent pics is as far 
<br />
as they go.
