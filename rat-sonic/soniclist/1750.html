<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;If you've seen &quot;Harmonic Sonic&quot; (it was on USA yesterday), did you notice 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the robots playing music?  Isn't that clearly a violation of Robotnik's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;laws as stated in the comics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	Music is a violation of Robotnik's rules. But then again, the music 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was being played on the SkySpy space station, miles out of Robotnik's reach. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For the sake of discussion, if Robotnik was on the SkySpy, the robots 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would probably not play their music. 
</em><br />

<br />
My own take on this is that you can blame it on the writer &quot;du jour&quot;
<br />
David Villaire.  During the show's first season, they literally had a
<br />
different writer for every ep.  It was only with the second season that
<br />
they settled on a single writing team headed by Pat Allee and Ben Hurst.
<br />
That kept the vision of Mobius somewhat more coherent.  The ban on music
<br />
I take to be a vestige of the &quot;Adventures of...&quot; syndicated series which
<br />
I hold to be of dubious canonicity (see below).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;We've already had 2 or 3 discussions over what year it is on Mobius, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;other things that are different between the weekend cartoon and the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;comics.  If someone is willing to compile a list of what's different 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;between the Sonic worlds (books, Archie comics, Fleetway comics, weekend 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;cartoon), I'll put it on the ftp site.  Or, this could go in one of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Sonic FAQ's.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can give you two to start with. First - Tails' age. When he was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; introduced in Sonic 2, he was only 3. When the comic was started two 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; years ago, he was 4 or 5. During the Adventures of Sonic cartoon, Tails 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was exactly 4 1/2. But, during one episode in the second season of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weekend Sonic (I don't recall the name, but it was the one that involved the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Power Stones), Sally said he was 10. Later, the comics took notice and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; modified his age.
</em><br />

<br />
This situation was a mess!  I'd appreciate knowing the story and issue
<br />
(&quot;chapter and verse&quot;) for Tails' age in the comics, but the Sonic Grams
<br />
of #29 try to explain away the discrepancy by invoking Sonic #14 (&quot;Tails'
<br />
Taste of Power&quot;) to explain how Tails could suddenly age 5 years.  BTW,
<br />
it was the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; ep that established Tails' age as 10, thus
<br />
demonstrating the acceptance of the SatAM series as canon.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 	The second discrepency - the real name of the walrus handyman. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When he was introduced in the comic, his name was Boomer. But, when the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; weekend Sonic showed him, his name was Rotor. In issue #12 (Sonic's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Christmas Carol), the comic officially changed his name to Rotor. They 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; first used his new name in the story, then they gave an explanation about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the name change in the SonicGrams section. They said they didn't want to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; create any conflicts with the TV show. (TOO LATE!!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />

<br />
Other discrepancies:
<br />

<br />
Perhaps one of the biggest was putting Knothole underground in the
<br />
beginning, whereas the TV show never had Knothole anywhere but out in
<br />
the open.
<br />

<br />
Uncle Chuck: the comics made him out to be a general tinkerer/chili dog
<br />
vendor, while &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; held that he was working for the
<br />
government when roboticized.  The circumstances of his mind being
<br />
restored also differ -- compare Sonic #30 with the &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot;
<br />
episode.
<br />

<br />
Bunnie's origins: open because the TV series never got around to
<br />
offering an explanation, though the story &quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot; (Sonic #3)
<br />
was followed by Teitelbaum.  Major difference: Blast to the Past
<br />
established Bunnie as a childhood friend of Sally and Sonic, whereas
<br />
there was no hint of that in Sonic #3.
<br />

<br />
Tails: we may be on the verge of an answer to the question of how Tails
<br />
got two tails: in &quot;de-Tails&quot; (the letters column in Tails #1), a
<br />
question about Tails' parents is answered by saying that it will
<br />
eventually be answered in an issue of Sonic.  So a Tails origin story,
<br />
if not a Tails reunion with his parent(s) story, may be in the works.
<br />
Knowing what happened to the script of &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, though, I don't
<br />
hope for the best.
