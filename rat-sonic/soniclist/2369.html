And now, yet another apology.
<br />

<br />
Normally, I would directly reply to someone who had said something that
<br />
was inflammatory to myself.  After all, I know how irritating it is to
<br />
see an irrevelant flame war bouncing into your mailbox every morning.
<br />
Therefore, I request that all future replies to this message from any
<br />
other parties be directly addressed to David and I personally.
<br />

<br />
This message is not at all StH related.  You may stop reading here.

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And Now, a Public Message from The FoxFire Studio Web Page
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;<a href="http://users.aol.com/dgonterman
">http://users.aol.com/dgonterman
</a>
</em><br />

<br />
And the expected reply by myself, Joseph de LaCroix, resident EFF
<br />
backer and an avid supporter of the First Amendment.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;---Ahem----
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;As I was typing this article out, I was noticing that the majority of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;internet are now dressed in black, as it were.  They are currently in morning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;over the fact that Satan's child, a.k.a. Bill Clinton, who may be defiling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the oval office with his presence but was never and will never be my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;president, (Rush Limbaugh is, you damn fools!!!) has signed the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Telecomunications Bill that makes cybersmut a crime and demands Violence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Chips on TVs.  
</em><br />

<br />
You certainly dislike Clinton, don't you?  While I also personally dislike
<br />
the man, I hope that you realize he has had very little to do with the
<br />
current state of the government.  After all, he *is* only a figurehead.
<br />
(I won't comment on Rush.)
<br />

<br />
Also, he had little choice but to sign the document.  If he would have
<br />
vetoed it, the Congress would have overriden it and made him look like
<br />
a supporter of &quot;kiddie porn&quot; (or whatever the ultraconservative lunatics
<br />
are crying that the Internet is filled with today).  If he would have
<br />
ignored it, he would have looked like a supporter of &quot;kiddie porn&quot;.  Thus,
<br />
the only politically viable move he had was to sign the accursed thing.
<br />
That's life.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You might think that I'm joining in on this &quot;party,&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;some of my pages are black, expecially the ones with the big pictures of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;artwork on it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They are *not* black for the above reason.  They are black so you can see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;pics better.  No other.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I find myself IN FAVOR of *somebody* controlling the availability of material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hazordous to minors on the Net (That's *smut* you dumb_at_$$!!), because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;believe that there is just too much Sexual Material crammed into their lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all at once.  Whatever happening to having fun, just making friends, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;getting to *know* your net.lover before you go to the back seat of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;486DX2-66?  Surely Nodoby on the net will pass a law to outlaw *that*!!!  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;will discuss this further later on in American Kitsune.
</em><br />

<br />
I am going, friends, to try to remain calm.
<br />

<br />
David, do you honestly mean that you want the United States government,
<br />
an organization that has so far f-ked up the economy of most of North
<br />
America and can barely keep order in its own capital; an organization
<br />
mostly made up of computer illiterate, old, white males; and an
<br />
organization with the ability to silence any irritating little schism
<br />
within its borders, controlling EXPRESSION on the Internet?!
<br />

<br />
In the name of whatever deity you worship, Gonterman, you're playing with
<br />
fire by supporting such lunacy.  Don't you realize that free speech, no
<br />
matter if it is offensive to you, is the most vital part of democracy?
<br />
The loss of it is the first step into a police state.  
<br />

<br />
Now, I agree that minors should be kept away from porn...by use of *local*
<br />
filters installed by (that's right) PARENTS.  You know, those people who
<br />
used to be able to control their children?  THEY should be the ones who
<br />
are responsible for what their children see, not a monolithic establishment
<br />
like the US government.  Honestly, if you can't control what your
<br />
children see, don't have them.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I would like to assure to my little rest stop on the Information Superhighway
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the Telecomuniation Bill *will not in any way* affect this page.  I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not allow such crap to even touch my page, and therefore do not have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for whoever's playing net.police raise a stink about.  The same goes for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;rat.org, now that the hentai ('Perverts' to those who aren't in Anime)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;department was removed, half a year before this Bill.  The same goes for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remainer of the Sonic Pages.  We're not www.playboy.com here.  We're just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;bunch of guys and gals discussing a Video Game universe for Pete's Sake!  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In a network the size of the entire cosmos, to boot!!  You think that anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;outside our little world *cares*?  I don't.
</em><br />

<br />
Take a look at the big picture, David.
<br />

<br />
The government will first take away the porno and the &quot;offensive&quot; materials
<br />
from the net, much to the glee of the Chirstian Coalition and other fringe
<br />
groups.  Then, perhaps they'll extend the law into the &quot;dangerous&quot; things
<br />
on the 'net; hacker stuff, cypherpunk pages, the HTMLized version of the
<br />
Jolly Roger, etc.  And after that, maybe a bit more of a stretch into
<br />
the realm of &quot;cults&quot;.  Then, the &quot;unpopular&quot; and &quot;weird&quot; sites will come
<br />
under the thumb of Uncle Sam.  And that, friends, is when they start to
<br />
become obvious in their oppression, even to the layman...
<br />

<br />
Free speech, no matter what the message is, should be allowed to flourish
<br />
all over the world; especially in America.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The average Joe Cyberjock will not be affected by the Telecommunications bill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which is trying to keep NC-36 rated crap from people who don't need it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their lives.  All this laments of censorship is just hysterical parinoia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;brought on by pinko commie liberals with tiny minds who think primarily with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their penises.  
</em><br />

<br />
Thank you, Mr. Bunker.  Insults from a flaming ultraconvervative neo-Nazi
<br />
dog, who thinks only with the peanut that happens to occupy the vacuous 
<br />
pocket between his ears, comes as a compliment to me, a mere pinko commie 
<br />
liberal with a tiny mind, who thinks primarily with my penis.
<br />

<br />
Name-calling: don't do it unless you want it back.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;They can have their little pics of doing dogs and naked ugly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;performance artists with a bullwhip in their anus.  I just don't want them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and the same goes for most of my fans!!!  
</em><br />

<br />
You think that's the only stuff that'll be affected?  Riiiight.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That's all.  The Net is NOT dead!!
</em><br />

<br />
Not yet.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Long live the Net!!!   And The FoxFire Studios will still be trucking down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Information Superhighway, no matter *what* Exon will think about it.
</em><br />

<br />
So YOUR stuff should be protected, while everyone ELSE'S can go right to
<br />
*Hell*, right?  That would be funny if it wasn't so damn STUPID.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Remember:  The only way to stop me is to kill me, and if I'm dead tomorrow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Clinton did it.
</em><br />

<br />
Clinton didn't do it, you plebian.  Clinton had to sign it in order to keep
<br />
from getting smacked with it during the election.  Congress and Senator
<br />
Exon actually *did* it.

&quot;When they came for the porno sites, I said nothing because I was not one.

When they came for the hacker sites, I said nothing because I was not one.

When they came for the weird sites, I said nothing becase I was not one.
