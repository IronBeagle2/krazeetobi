<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And after seeing some of the flames and personal attacks against me, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wish I had known about those people so I could have banned them from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;list sooner.
</em><br />

<br />
&lt;Eyes pop out of head, jaw drops to floor&gt; You really DON'T CARE, DO YOU?!
<br />
&lt;Shakes head in dismay&gt; Now, I ADMIT that some of the reactions have been
<br />
outta line, but so have several things that YOU'VE done.  It makes me sad
<br />
that you would do away with those people who speak their minds and tell you
<br />
your faults, when you should actually be REMEMBERING what you've done wrong
<br />
so that you can be a better person in the future.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This is not a democracy. For example, if EVERYONE wrote me and said they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wanted fanfic to be permitted to be posted, do you think I would allow it?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't think so.
</em><br />

<br />
That's ODD, I seem to recall your VERY EXCUSE for not allowing fanfic was
<br />
that SOME PEOPLE were inconvenienced by large posts.  So you're saying that
<br />
was a LIE????!!!!!!  Or, possibly not a LIE, but not the FOREMOST reason,
<br />
EITHER.  I feel betrayed to NO END.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And to those freeloading scum, I say, &quot;I wish you had shown your true
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;colors before so I could have kicked your ungrateful ass off.&quot;
</em><br />

<br />
Well, I'm GLAD that YOU didn't show YOUR true colors before, because, had
<br />
you done so, I'd've quit this list a year ago and wouldn't be who I am today.
<br />

<br />
Go ahead and unsubscribe me if you wish, but I BEG you to at LEAST remember
<br />
this post and those that Joe wrote, because I hope OTHERS don't have to put
<br />
up with this side of you.  You've been generous to us all, Rat, and have
<br />
given us a haven...all you've done has been what you thought to be in
<br />
people's best interests, with a few exceptions.  I want people to remember
<br />
THAT side of you, the side Matt Penna knows, not the side Joe DeLaCroix
<br />
knows...I'm trying REAL HARD to remember you as Matt does, but I keep
<br />
finding myself agreeing with Joe...
<br />

<br />

Signing off...for possibly the last time.  8(
