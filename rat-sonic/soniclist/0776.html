<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In warp space, Dulcy was unable to see anything in the
<br />
&quot;otherspace&quot; which she and David were now in, so she experienced
<br />
the flight utilizing her other senses.  She felt no push or pull
<br />
during warp travel, not even in the initial acceleration phase
<br />
when the graviton warp field accrued the energy to pass into FTL
<br />
space.  There was no feeling of warmth or cold, aside from the
<br />
heat that was generated in her from her instinctive response to
<br />
the potentially hazardous endeavor.  No sound was detected by
<br />
her sensitive dragon ears, nor any discernible odor from the
<br />
environment detectable with her nose.  Opening her eyes
<br />
slightly, she noticed a blinding white light that permeated the
<br />
visible universe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It then exploded into a flash of blue light as David
<br />
decelerated himself and Dulcy to a low-sublight velocity.  The
<br />
Cerenkov radiation from the dying warp field rapidly dissipated,
<br />
spreading its graviton shearing force throughout the sky.  They
<br />
had successfully returned to their normal universe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All her senses returned to her, the most prominent one being
<br />
her sense of gravity.  Without compensating for the differences
<br />
of transition from a gravimetrically-stable point in space to a
<br />
total loss of it, she began falling at a rate of 9.8 meters per
<br />
second squared.  A scream from Dulcy notified David of his
<br />
friend's sinking condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A swoop downward executed by the vulpine plus a retrieval
<br />
spared the dragon from a certain demise.  From their location,
<br />
three kilometers above ground level, the alternative would have
<br />
most certainly be destructive.  Dulcy eventually became aware of
<br />
the fact that her decent had been terminated, plus the feeling
<br />
of warm paws and arms on her abdomen.  Able to control her wings
<br />
again, she flapped them, and felt the release of pressure from
<br />
her stomach, indicating that her savior determined that she was
<br />
flight-capable again.  She would live to be a Freedom Fighter
<br />
for another day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please forgive me, Dulcy,&quot; David said with a concerned look on
<br />
his face as he came to a hover a meter in front of her.  &quot;I
<br />
apparently didn't allow you the required amount of time to act
<br />
upon the warp/realspace transition.  Are you injured in any way?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing besides my pride,&quot; Dulcy returned with embarrassment,
<br />
belatedly realizing that she had failed to use the very piece of
<br />
equipment given to her by evolution, as opposed to David's
<br />
bequest by complex design of his rotor/nacelles and many hours
<br />
of testing.  If only privately, she had been upstaged by an
<br />
artificial lifeform that probably wasn't even intended to be
<br />
flight-capable in the first place.  But David had progressed
<br />
beyond his original design, both in technology and mentality.
<br />
She knew in the back of her mind that the last thing her closest
<br />
comrade would think of was the feeling of superiority.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compuorganic fox apparently wasn't convinced by her
<br />
statement of health.  He activated all his sensors to
<br />
investigate the true nature behind the dragon's tone of voice.
<br />
His sensors downloaded the required data billions of times in a
<br />
nanosecond, and his computers checked and rechecked the data for
<br />
validity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing this take place and realizing what David was doing, she
<br />
spoke with somewhat more control a second later, &quot;No need to
<br />
look me over, David.  I'm fine.  I was just a little thrown back
<br />
by the sudden stop.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He apparently wasn't completely satisfied with her explanation,
<br />
but also wasn't inclined to continue the conversation further on
<br />
what was obviously a situation more of disgrace than physical
<br />
harm, if only to Dulcy.  &quot;I have located ten possible sites for
<br />
us to investigate,&quot; he began, now all Freedom Fighter Commander
<br />
again.  &quot;There is an area of interest as a possible habitation
<br />
site 700.7 kilometers from our location.  It has an unusually
<br />
high concentration of metal, possible fuel resources, and water.
<br />
&nbsp;Are you prepared for the operation?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; she dictated with more determination than she felt she
<br />
had.  &quot;Let's go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was having second thoughts about practicing her landing
<br />
procedure, but she and David had both signed an unwritten pact
<br />
to complete a mission and to keep a promise that they made the
<br />
past night.  For her to refuse would be futile, due to the fact
<br />
that her associate wasn't the typical kind of person that would
<br />
understand excuses.  You either agreed on a promise with David
<br />
and kept it, or you never approached him with the proposal in
<br />
the first place.  No gray area existed in his interpretation,
<br />
part of what made him the fox he was today.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two seconds later, she was reflecting on her vulpine
<br />
colleague's philosophy at another point in the space/time
<br />
continuum...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...And en route to her first touchdown of the day.  She and
<br />
David were both flying (under their own power this time) above a
<br />
plateau, near the border of the Dark Mountains and the Great
<br />
Unknown.  Dulcy didn't exactly know what was down in that area,
<br />
but David had been able to study a great deal of geological data
<br />
about many locations on Mobius, from what little information
<br />
there was available at Knothole.  The Dark Mountains region was
<br />
at the forefront of his interest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Dark Mountains,' his compuorganic computer systems instantly
<br />
identified.  'A 1.45 billion year-old exposed intrusion of
<br />
gabbro, formed by an unexplained and unusual rise of magma
<br />
through the crust.  Possibilities:  natural gaps in crust, or a
<br />
cavity induced by a meteor.  Meteor theory may explain the high
<br />
concentration of iridium and radiogenic potassium near the
<br />
Kathurc and Dueler age boundaries.  Has been subjected to time
<br />
and erosion, but apparently still remains prominent;  not worn
<br />
away.  Isostacy (the balance between erosion and rock rise to
<br />
compensate for displaced mass) may explain why the area has not
<br />
been lost to time.'  While spending a picosecond to formulate
<br />
his own interpretations about the geological significance of the
<br />
oldest known rock on Mobius, he executed a local scan of their
<br />
immediate point over the border.  What his sensors told him was
<br />
in the fifty kilometer radius he didn't exactly care for.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting as nonchalant as he could giving the potential outcome
<br />
of their continued flight pattern over a now-designated
<br />
hazardous area, he spoke to the dragon, &quot;Try over there, Dulcy.
<br />
That should permit you a long landing space.&quot;  He indicated the
<br />
desired area to her with a 5 microwatt phaser, sufficient for
<br />
location purposes;  not as a weapon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you sure about this, David?&quot; she asked, nervously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only response from the black and gray vulpine was a stern
<br />
glare.  No arguments in regard to the proposition from him would
<br />
be listened to or considered.  That much was made clear sans
<br />
vocal dialect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Going down,&quot; was all she could submit with resignation.  She
<br />
tilted her body down, continuing until she obtained a thirty
<br />
degree aspect with the ground.  She was able to maintain a
<br />
stable approach flight until she was about half a kilometer
<br />
above the granitic rock of her landing strip.  At that height,
<br />
her tension built into a gargantuan monster, clasping her in its
<br />
jaws.  First, her stability wavered;  then eventually developed
<br />
into more of an uncontrolled fall rather than a controlled
<br />
flight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing his companion's deviation, David conjured a plan to
<br />
give Dulcy something else to focus on.  Matching his velocity to
<br />
hers and surpassing it by 20%, he flew under her abdominal
<br />
region, then grasped her pouch lip as he disengaged the rotation
<br />
of his rotor/nacelles.  They were both quickly approaching the
<br />
ground, so it was necessary to act with as much haste as
<br />
possible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He called to his peer, &quot;Dulcy, to what degree do you enjoy my
<br />
company?&quot;  He retained his grip on her pouch, the induced wind
<br />
shear now threatening to strip him away from his stronghold as
<br />
the dragon accelerated toward the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A lot. Why'd you ask, David?&quot; she inquired, baffled that her
<br />
friend would demand such information from her at a time like
<br />
this.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Prove it to me,&quot; he commanded as he expertly flipped himself
<br />
into her pouch.  He had no intention of leaving it, regardless
<br />
of the outcome of her landing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pressure mounted, only this time of a different sort.  In
<br />
Dulcy's mind, the effects of the landings that she would
<br />
normally perform were now out of the question.  This time, David
<br />
would be right under her if the touchdown wasn't successful.  A
<br />
mistake here would be injurious, if not fatal, to him.  Being
<br />
compressed between approximately one metric ton of dragon plus a
<br />
magnitude of two billion times that from the granite and
<br />
acceleration due to gravity wouldn't exactly allow the vulpine
<br />
to be in an amicable mood afterwards.  It would have to be
<br />
perfect the first time, period.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her approach straightened out at about 100 meters above her
<br />
target.  At about fifty meters above ground, she gradually
<br />
raised her body to a point beyond being perpendicular to it,
<br />
taking precautions with her wings and the rest of her
<br />
aerodynamic aspect.  She slowed as the aerodynamic drag took
<br />
effect, but she had compensated a bit too much for her velocity
<br />
decrease.  Her landing pattern would have been excellent.  The
<br />
only problem was, in order for it to be so, the granite plateau
<br />
had to be in a position two meters higher than it was then.
<br />
Both fox and dragon experienced a mutual session off attraction
<br />
to the dense igneous rock, then a debilitating dizziness induced
<br />
from their resonance to the impact.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's graviton differential stabilizers dissipated the shock,
<br />
conducting the resonance and spreading it throughout his body to
<br />
prevent a focused point in the field.  The majority of it
<br />
transferred to Dulcy, enhancing her own disorientation.  She had
<br />
a tenuous contact with the ground, swaying forward and back, as
<br />
if unable to decide what to do next.  He leaped out of her pouch
<br />
to the more stable granite, and used his navigational deflector
<br />
to assist the beleaguered dragon front-down.  The field created
<br />
an air cushion between the excited gravitons and her body, and
<br />
gradually compressed downward until she was at a stable position
<br />
on the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She remained sprawled out in that position for about a minute,
<br />
then woke up from the shock.  &quot;Ooohh, hello Ma.  Yes, I cleaned
<br />
the cave,&quot; she warbled.  She then continued muttering phrases
<br />
that either only she understood, or that came out by a reflex
<br />
reaction to a particularly unfavorable landing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hoping to give Dulcy a reference point to the present, David
<br />
said, &quot;Excuse me, Dulcy, but I don't believe I understood your
<br />
mannerisms in that dialect.  Would you please explain that to
<br />
me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT gave her the incentive she needed.  After forcing the
<br />
disorientation out of her head, she rose back to a standing
<br />
position, regarding her comrade with nervous concern.  David
<br />
returned the focus of attention, only with look of mock
<br />
discordance.  The two Freedom Fighters, commander and
<br />
subordinate, gauged each other with a novel intensity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David finally spoke again, sparing his female associate the
<br />
trial of wordless communication.  &quot;You don't wish to continue
<br />
our friendship, do you Dulcy?&quot;  Despite what could have been a
<br />
adverse situation for him, he wasn't in a mood to be severe.  In
<br />
fact, he was willing to be almost jovial about it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy, on the other paw, did not anticipate the fox's
<br />
approximately convivial attitude, and reacted accordingly.  &quot;Oh
<br />
no, I really do, David.  It's that...weeelll, the ground was
<br />
coming up too fast , and I had to do...&quot;  She trailed off into
<br />
hopeless babble about the events that transpired in the landing,
<br />
while her commander gradually felt an increase in his humor
<br />
register.  When the register read 256, he initiated an
<br />
uncontrollable laughter subroutine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he had reacquired some of his control, he said, &quot;I'm
<br />
afraid I am the one who must apologize, Dulcy.  I just find the
<br />
situation so...humorous.  I thought that you, of anyone, would
<br />
have no trouble knowing exactly where ground level was.&quot;  More
<br />
guffaws from David, then Dulcy chimed in her own, as she thought
<br />
the matter over herself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's slackened muzzle immediately contorted and hardened
<br />
into a grave stare.  While he and Dulcy were both learning more
<br />
about each other's humor, his sensors had been scanning the
<br />
entire area around them within a fifty kilometer radius.  Within
<br />
that radius was a concealed base (which explained the
<br />
high-metallic concentration).  He counted the Hover Units,
<br />
SWATBots and other robots in the base, along with other items of
<br />
interest: fusion and geothermal power sources, advanced computer
<br />
technology, and weapons systems.  David had detected all of this
<br />
on his first scan pass in the air, and again here on the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;He had anticipated that the remote laser defense systems would
<br />
be able to strike them down from the air.  What he HAD NOT
<br />
anticipated was that the 1.56 MW laser emitters and targeting
<br />
systems had greater than 180 degrees of vertical axis
<br />
displacement capability, since the apparent design indicated
<br />
otherwise in his scan.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was correct in the assumption, but the lasers were
<br />
apparently able to obtain more vertical axis displacement by
<br />
permanently damaging their constrictive outer shells.  One of
<br />
the lasers had an emitter tube in this configuration, and also
<br />
had both Freedom Fighters detected and targeted.  An attosecond
<br />
after David detected that the optical targeting sensors had a
<br />
definite sight picture, a 630 kW discharge of focused red light
<br />
was expelled from the emitter.  The beam traveled at 300
<br />
megameters/second to its targets, the air in the immediate
<br />
vicinity of the focused light discharge screaming with protest
<br />
as the lethal energy forced its way to the ground.
<br />
