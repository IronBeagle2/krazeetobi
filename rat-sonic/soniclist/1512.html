<br />To subscribe the comic, you may try to write to
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SONIC THE COMIC
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Subs Dept.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aim Ltd.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PO Box 10
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pallion Industrial Estate
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunderland, SR4 6SN
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England
<br />
<br />To order back issues, write to
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SONIC BACK ISSUE ZONE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aim Ltd.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;England
<br />
<br />The price is 1.20 pounds sterling for each issue (price has been  
<br />
increased), including postage &amp; packing.  Minimum order is four issues.  
<br />
Checks must be payable to _Fleetway Editions Ltd._ and must be in pounds  
<br />
sterling.  (Maybe it will cost more because you live in America... better  
<br />
call them by phone first.)
<br />
<br />To ask them questions about a subscription and/or order by credit card
<br />
dial 01144-91-510-2290.
<br />
<br />You may also try to send e-mail to their fan-page (much like the
<br />
Sonic-Grams page).  The address is
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stc_at_richb.demon.co.uk
<br />
<br />Here is a list of some of the REAL good stories in the Fleetway Sonic  
<br />
comic (they have some that are crap too, but not nearly as much as Archie  
<br />
has).  You can also check the STC Story Checklist that I posted earlier  
<br />
for more info.
<br />
<br />If you like Knuckles solo-stories:
<br />
<br />_Karnival Night Conspiracy_, issue #39 - #44
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marxio Brothers try to take over the Carnival Night Zone on the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating Island.
<br />
<br />_Total Chaotix_, issue #53 - #58
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaption of the 'Knuckles Chaotix' game.  The Chaotix team fights the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brotherhood Of Metallix in Robotnik's abandoned Egg Fortress.
<br />
<br />If you want stories about our blue speedster Sonic The Hedgehog:
<br />
<br />_Super Sonic_, issue #7
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saves the Oil Ocean Zone and turns into Super Sonic while he
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;fights an Aquis.
<br />
<br />_The Origin Of Sonic_, _Back To Reality_ and _Megatox_, issue #8 - #10
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is something like a 3-part-story.  Sonic's and Robotnik's origin
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;is explained, referring to the Fleetway storyline.  This is also the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;start of a new concept in the Fleetway comic.  More 'adult' stories,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik now uses 'real' SWATBot armies instead of the usual Badniks
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;from the game etc.
<br />
<br />_Girl Trouble_, issue #21 - #22
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;First appearance of Amy Rose.  Sonic saves Amy from being turned into
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a Badnik by Robotnik.  Amy becomes a member of Sonic's Freedom Fighter
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;group.
<br />
<br />_The Sonic Terminator_, issue #24 - #28
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaption of the 'Sonic CD' game... real thrilling.  Metal Sonic kidnaps
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Amy Rose to lure Sonic to the Miracle Planet and finish him off.  Sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;defeats Metal Sonic by travelling back in time and chnaging the past.
<br />
<br />_Enter Knuckles_ and _Power Of The Chaos Emeralds_, issue #33 - #36
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaption of the 'Sonic III' game.
<br />
<br />_Day Of The Death Egg_, _Mystery Of The Sandopolis Zone_,
<br />
_Count Down To Disaster_ and _Disaster!_, issue #45, #47 - #53
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Adaption of the 'Sonic &amp; Knuckles' game.  This one is split into four
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;chapters,  divided over eight issues.  Sonic &amp; Knuckles fight Robotnik
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;on the Floating Island, destroy the repaired Death Egg and retrieve the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Emerald from Robotnik.
<br />
<br />_The Brotherhood Of Metallix_, issue #59 - ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the sequel to the 'Knuckles Chaotix' adaption.  The Brotherhood Of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Metallix has taken over Robotnik's abandoned Egg-Fortress in the Special
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Zone.  They kidnap Grimer (very similar to Snively, but much more
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;intelligent) to build an Alpha Device for them.  Robotnik finally captures
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic but has to join forces with him to have a chance to defeat the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Metallixes.  Sonic enters the Special Zone, but he can't stop the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Metallixes from escaping to the Miracle Planet (where Sonic defeated the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;first Metallix in 'The Sonic Terminator').
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;This story is still running, the current issue is #60.  I also don't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;know what the Alpha Device is for.
<br />
<br />If you are looking for Tails solo-stories, you should try to get
<br />
<br />_Zonerunner &amp; The Big Freeze_, issue #48 - #51
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails fights an evil robot called Nutzan Bolt, who has taken over the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chemical Plant Zone.
<br />
<br />_The Revenge Of Trogg_, issue #59 - ?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a Knuckles &amp; Tails team-up.  Tails &amp; Knuckles are brought to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the Nameless Zone to save the Enchanter Kings.  (In the Fleetway
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Comic, this zone once was Tails' home, and because he wanted everyone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there to be proud of him he told them that HE would be the hero of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mobius and not Sonic.)
<br />
<br />Hope this helps
<br />
<br /><br />Alessandro
