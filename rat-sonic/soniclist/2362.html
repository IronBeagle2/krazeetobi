This is in response to those who suggest a SONIC series geared toward older
<br />
readers while letting the younger readers have their version.
<br />

<br />
Economics is not the driving force here. The main factor is what is best for
<br />
the corporate interests. Let's start with Archie, because they're a basic,
<br />
bottom-line company. Archie is Disney, pure and simple. When they veer into
<br />
other things is comparable to Disney using Miramax or Touchstone or Hollywood
<br />
Pictures as a smokescreen to do non-traditional Disney fare. Disney is many
<br />
times bigger, granted, than Archie, but what both companies are founded on is
<br />
good, clean wholesome family fun. You KNOW what to expect from an Archie
<br />
comic. Even when he met the Punisher, it was Archie's established style that
<br />
set the tone for the book. 
<br />

<br />
Then you have SEGA, which created SONIC as an answer to Nintendo's SUPER
<br />
MARIO. (Remember them?) Sonic became popular with game players of all ages,
<br />
especially kids, and so SEGA sought to cement that family image with a
<br />
product produced by Archie Comics. Not DC. Not Marvel. Not even Image or Dark
<br />
Horse. It wasn't until after Mike and I wrote &quot;THIS ISLAND HEDGEHOG&quot; guest
<br />
starring Knuckles that SEGA began re-evaluating their attitudes about how the
<br />
characters should be handled. We submitted a sequel to &quot;TIH&quot; titled simply
<br />
&quot;RETURN TO THE FLOATING ISLAND&quot;, featuring more elements of the SONIC 3 game
<br />
that didn't make it into issue #13. SEGA put that story on-hold, as they were
<br />
trying to figure out how to market KNUCKLES to an older teen crowd. By this
<br />
time, especially with the Saturday morning cartoon rating really high with
<br />
the kids, it became clear that anything that featured SONIC and his pals was
<br />
going to be scooped up by the kid crowd. If we had put out a KNUCKLES book
<br />
aimed at an older teen crowd, the parents of the pre-teen set would be out
<br />
for blood, because here they would've bought a product they thought was
<br />
appropriate for their little ones. The people at Archie knew this and
<br />
resisted efforts to push toward the older crowd. Mike and I were among those
<br />
that supported Archie in this. Sure, it meant we couldn't do some things we
<br />
would have liked to, but it did force us to get more creative in our approach
<br />
to the material.
<br />

<br />
I have an 8-year-old son who was very much into SONIC, even before his dad
<br />
started writing the book. In fact, it was his interest that led me to take
<br />
the assignment of writing the stories. He's my barometer of what type of
<br />
stories to do and how far I can push the envelope. I also have many friends
<br />
with children who read the stories to their children. Their comments are
<br />
always carefully considered when I try to incorporate an idea or concept that
<br />
might be too &quot;adult&quot; for the book. I'm always striving for the balance.
<br />

<br />
If one chooses to, one can go back and reread the stories Mike and I have
<br />
done on a number of levels. For example, &quot;IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT&quot;, I had a
<br />
number of mothers read this story to see if we handled the subject of death
<br />
appropriately enough. Not one objected. Not one. On the other hand &quot;FIRST
<br />
STAR I SEE TONIGHT&quot; elicited knowing laughs from the same audience at the
<br />
appropriate moments. Then there's the concepts of other dimensions, parallel
<br />
universes, time travel and other science fiction staples. I try to make
<br />
certain the concept can be grasped easily enough by the non-science fiction
<br />
fan, but it gets tricky. 
<br />

<br />
If this is not quite what you were hoping for, at least there is a book that
<br />
can be enjoyed with the possibility of expanding the envelope wherever and
<br />
whenever we can. (All within the boundaries of good taste, of course.)
