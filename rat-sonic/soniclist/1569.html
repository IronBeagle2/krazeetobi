<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group arrived back at Knothole amid cheers for the success of the
<br />
mission.  Vision had changed back into a fox earlier, to avoid startling too
<br />
many others in Knothole, and was mingling with the crowd quite well.  Sonic
<br />
was, of course, aggrandizing his role in the mission for everyone.  Antoine
<br />
was, of course, exaggerating his role.  Tails excitedly shared what he
<br />
experienced with anyone and everyone.  This went on for about an hour,
<br />
before everything went back to normal.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision, Sonic, Sally, and Bunnie were sitting by a tree stump, after
<br />
the crowd died down.  &quot;It's too bad we can't get help like you provided us
<br />
on our mission everyday, Vision..&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, &quot; added Sonic, &quot;Though I guess I do understand that Third Rule
<br />
of yours, at least a little, it's still too bad we can't get your help
<br />
anymore...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision just grinned... &quot;Well, yanno... I have a feeling we might be
<br />
help out a little bit here and there in the future.. Bunnie, you still got
<br />
that 'toy' I gave you earlier?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie blinked. &quot;Toy? Oh yeah, I fergot I was carryin' this around
<br />
still... &quot; She handed the large rifle back to Vision.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision chuckled. He examined the rifle a bit, then opened up the handle
<br />
and pulled out what looked like the power source.  &quot;A Harani micro-fusion
<br />
battery.  The Harani don't give out their tech to just anyone, and they
<br />
most certainly wouldn't give it to the likes of Crazy Ivo.  This, and what
<br />
Blue Boy here told me on the way to Robotropolis, proves that Ivo's been
<br />
getting offworld help.  That should let us offer a little help from time to
<br />
time, though not on as major a scale as I did today. That directly involved
<br />
us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded.  &quot;I understand. Any help we get is good for us, and well
<br />
appreciated.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision smiled. &quot;Why, thank you.&quot;  He then yawned a bit, and got up. &quot;I
<br />
must leave now, however, since today has made my body desire a nice warm
<br />
bath back at Haven.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others chuckled, then gave their farewells. &quot;Stay cool, Vis!&quot; &quot;Hope
<br />
to see y'all soon!&quot; &quot;Goodbye, and thanks again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision smiled. &quot;Farewell everyone. Perhaps you'll see more of us in the
<br />
future. As for me, you can count on it.&quot;  With that, he snapped his fingers. 
<br />
A streak of bright green energy formed at the top of his head and spiraled
<br />
down his body, leaving behind a faint blue afterimage of him, which faded
<br />
away. Then he was gone.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others blinked, then Sally giggled.  &quot;I suppose we should expect
<br />
the unexpected from him from now on.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie giggled as well.  &quot;Yeah, he sure is a strange one, but his
<br />
heart's in the right place. Ah wouldn't mind seein' him again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked, leaning against the stump. &quot;Yeah, he's cool.  Always
<br />
knew he was cool.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally raised an eyebrow. &quot;Oh, you did, did you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I knew he was cool from the moment I laid eyes on him. Had cool
<br />
written all over him, right from the start,&quot; said Sonic, closing his eyes
<br />
and smirking even more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie stifled a giggle, and Sally rolled her eyes upward. &quot;Uh-huh...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was obviously on a roll now. &quot;Of course, ya do realize that he
<br />
wasn't as cool as me. _Nooo_one's_ as cool as your's truly...&quot; Sally and
<br />
Bunnie got up and silently walked off as Sonic continued. &quot;Yup, me, I'm Way
<br />
Past Cool. I'm the coolest thing to hit Mobius since the Ice Age. I'm...
<br />
Hey??&quot;  He noticed that he was alone, and that Sally and Bunnie were heading
<br />
elsewhere in Knothole. He darted after them yelling, &quot;Hey guys, wait up!
<br />
Hey! C'mon, what gives...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E N D
