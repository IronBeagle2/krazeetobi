<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the point of view of the two Knothole Freedom Fighters,
<br />
the temporal displacement effects were unpleasant and moderately
<br />
painful.  It was as if the temporal transport beam was stripping
<br />
them apart, atom by atom.  They felt their DNA split into its
<br />
component strands and recombine a billion times per second, as
<br />
though their DNA was struggling with great difficulty to
<br />
maintain contact with the current time period.  The very essence
<br />
of their bodies valiantly attempting to combat the effects of
<br />
the beam, but the beam eventually became the victor.  After the
<br />
transport initialization phase was complete, Sonic and Sally
<br />
felt themselves literally thrown into an unknown future time.
<br />
There was a flash of intense red light, and then the two found
<br />
themselves lost in the Great Unknown, but this place was far
<br />
more alien to them than the Great Unknown of their time.  It was
<br />
the Great Unknown of the distant future.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the present, Robotnik was thoroughly enjoying his latest
<br />
victory over his worst adversaries.  After eleven years of
<br />
contending with a teenage hedgehog and his friends, and losing
<br />
in the process, this event was one to be celebrated.  Now that
<br />
the foundation of the Knothole Freedom Fighters had been razed
<br />
from existence (at least in this time period), the rest the
<br />
infrastructure should fall eventually.  With the fall of the
<br />
Knothole Freedom Fighter front, Mobius would be in his hands, to
<br />
have and control.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes!&quot; Robotnik exclaimed with excitement and accomplishment.
<br />
&quot;Now, to celebrate.&quot;  An evil chuckle from Robotnik came forth,
<br />
lasting for about two minutes.  When he managed to regain his
<br />
composure, he turned to face Packbell and said, &quot;Very good shot,
<br />
Packbell.  If you weren't already at your position in the chain
<br />
of command, I would promote you.  However, since I cannot do so,
<br />
I will merely congratulate you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, Doctor Robotnik,&quot; Packbell responded, also gratified
<br />
to see Sonic and Sally vanish from the current timeline,
<br />
although appended with a more insidious motive.  He had been
<br />
waiting for the perfect time to terminate Robotnik's reign to
<br />
begin his own, and the &quot;death&quot; of the hedgehog seemed to be the
<br />
most auspicious opportunity to do so.  Yes, Robotnik might be
<br />
somewhat more readily caught off guard this time.  In fact....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An unusual sight caught Packbell's eye.  He hurriedly directed
<br />
his sensors over the control panel of the temporal displacement
<br />
device.  There was a graphical bar that steadily lengthened
<br />
toward an area shaded in red.  Although Packbell couldn't even
<br />
begin to translate the Cassandran language and understand the
<br />
control labels, a feeling of dread increased within him in
<br />
synchronization with the bar.  What he saw, he instinctively
<br />
didn't believe was productive to his future survival.  As if the
<br />
machine wished to acknowledge that hypothesis, an audio signal
<br />
steadily increased in volume in coordination with the
<br />
lengthening bar.  It was unnoticeable at first, then it became
<br />
apparent to both Packbell and Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Robotnik first became aware of the unusual noise, he
<br />
stepped over to the control panel.  Observing that Packbell was
<br />
shocked with fear, or otherwise in a positronic-lockup due to a
<br />
problem he couldn't resolve, Robotnik looked over the control
<br />
panel to obtain an understanding of what would strike such an
<br />
unsettling response in Packbell.  He noticed that a graphical
<br />
bar was stretching uncomfortably close to a shaded red area.
<br />
Robotnik froze in place, for he knew in the back of his mind
<br />
what was happening, and felt foolish for assuming that the power
<br />
cells in the device would be stable enough to safely retain
<br />
their charge without facing the risk of an unrecoverable power
<br />
feedback loop.  The last thing Robotnik saw was a flash of
<br />
lethal radiation, and then nothing more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as on Cassandra, the fate of Mobius depended on the fate
<br />
of an ultimate weapon.  The difference in the comparison was
<br />
that the weapon itself would be responsible for destroying the
<br />
planet that its lifeforms knew and loved.  In its own sort of
<br />
way, the weapon seemed to wish to atone for the crime of its
<br />
survival, so its only solution was to destroy itself.  The
<br />
morals of its use made no difference;  preventing any further
<br />
utilization was all that mattered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no place on Mobius for anyone or anything to avoid
<br />
the global carnage that would reform the planet just as the
<br />
format command reinitializes a hard drive.  An explosion
<br />
occurred at ground zero of the probe's crash site, ejecting
<br />
gigatons of dust into the atmosphere.  The explosion was also
<br />
powerful enough to create resonance in the crust and mantle
<br />
throughout the planet.  Shockwaves transmitted through the
<br />
mantle caused the crust to restructure into waves, and finally
<br />
into fragments of mixed granodiorite/basalt material when the
<br />
stress was too great for the crust to withstand.  Continents and
<br />
oceans alike steamed with fury in the catastrophe.  The
<br />
fragments and dust slowly sank into the exposed mantle, leaving
<br />
nothing to go to waste.  In a matter of minutes, the planet that
<br />
was Mobius to its inhabitants became a hot radioactive sphere of
<br />
undifferentiated molten rock.  The new world had an opportunity
<br />
to become a biological storehouse, but at the cost of losing
<br />
everything its predecessor had.  It would be a long wait before
<br />
the genesis of new life would occur in the body of a very simple
<br />
and unassuming lifeform, and much longer before two certain
<br />
displaced lifeforms from the previous world would appear.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
Dawn of an new eon...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reformation of the planet was remarkably similar to
<br />
Earth's, with differences in the formation of the key elements
<br />
as far as time was concerned.  Asteroids fell into the magma
<br />
ocean, though not the swarms that existed in Mobius' initial
<br />
formation about 4.6 billion years ago.  With the decreased
<br />
introduction of new material into the planet's microcosm, the
<br />
global magma ocean cooled considerably faster at the surface
<br />
than it had the first time.  In about 100 million years, the
<br />
first piece of basaltic crust formed and remained floating on
<br />
the magma.  Having a base to expand on, more basalt formed and
<br />
cooled until the planet was covered with a primordial basaltic
<br />
crust.  Occasionally breaks formed in the crust, caused either
<br />
by limited input from asteroids or differential stress in the
<br />
mantle.  From these fractured areas came the vapors that would
<br />
form the first reducing atmosphere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about 300 million years, the atmosphere remained relatively
<br />
stable.  That was until the introduced water content became high
<br />
enough to permanently change all that.  Storms of lightning
<br />
emerged, and with storms came torrential rains to cool the crust
<br />
and form a global ocean.  The ocean remained dominant for about
<br />
a few million years, but the crust was not content to remain
<br />
under the ocean's rule.  Continents started forming, encroaching
<br />
on the ocean's territory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At about this time in the history of the new world, the basic
<br />
building blocks of life started forming in the ocean and pools
<br />
of water found on the infant continents.  These amino acids
<br />
eventually began forming chains, and these chains found others
<br />
of their kind to combine with.  Nearly two billion years after
<br />
the global catastrophe that Robotnik had caused, life had
<br />
reinstated its hold on Mobius.  One progression followed
<br />
another, and the series continued until many forms of diverse
<br />
life literally exploded into existence (similar to the event
<br />
that took place at the Precambrian/Cambrian time boundary).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about 200 million years, life remained in its birthplace,
<br />
the ocean.  Due to reasons unknown, some simple forms of plant
<br />
life began to see the logic of exploiting the virgin environment
<br />
of the upper world, so they made the first advancement toward
<br />
the open spaces of exposed igneous and sedimentary rock.  The
<br />
rogue plant life didn't survive for very long out of the water,
<br />
but life evolved, and soon (in geologic terms) plants extended
<br />
complicated root systems into the remains of their pioneering
<br />
ancestors. It is at this point where Sonic and Sally reappeared
<br />
in Mobius' geologic time record.
<br />

<br />
The present future...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their time travel was completed in a matter of seconds relative
<br />
to them, yet Sonic and Sally's journey spanned an
<br />
incomprehensible span of time in realspace.  The Mobius they
<br />
knew was an ancient, dead world without any sign in the new
<br />
world that its predecessor had ever existed.  They were aliens,
<br />
potentially pieces of future evolution on the new world (or not
<br />
if life would eventually evolve differently this time around).
<br />
In any case, they didn't belong in this time period.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair were cast out from the temporal displacement
<br />
singularity, as if it were a predator that didn't like the taste
<br />
of its quarry after the kill.  After a two meter drop, Sonic and
<br />
Sally lied on the ground, still paralyzed by the initialization
<br />
phase.  As their DNA returned to normal, they both gained more
<br />
interactive contact with their new environment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was the first to gradually regain consciousness.  He
<br />
found himself lying flat, with his frontal region in full
<br />
contact with a shallow carbonate mud pool.  Fortunately, his
<br />
head was on a more solid, but still relatively soft carbonate
<br />
mud mound.  If that were not the case, he would have drowned in
<br />
twenty centimeters of mud.  Not blind to the irony of the
<br />
situation, he briefly thought about how he could confront
<br />
Robotnik and all his robots, only to be forced into time travel
<br />
and nearly meet his demise in a pungent mud pool.  Not exactly
<br />
the main event of his life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another thing that Sonic noticed was something all too familiar
<br />
about the mud itself.  Of course the color was sufficient enough
<br />
to tell the hedgehog otherwise, and the mud was full of calcium
<br />
carbonate material and not an intricate mixture of quicksand,
<br />
petroleum, and clay mud, but he could swear that it felt like
<br />
MegaMuck.  He tested his extremities to confirm this.  His
<br />
fingers didn't flex very well, and it was a battle just to
<br />
slightly bend his arms and legs.  All too familiar a reminder of
<br />
the old world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he felt himself coming further out from the shocked state
<br />
induced by the time travel, Sonic noticed that there was
<br />
something warm and furry resting on the left side his back.
<br />
Rotating his head to the general direction of the contact area,
<br />
he saw Sally's head there.  Sonic breathed a sigh of relief.  He
<br />
wasn't the only one to explore the intricacies of their mutual
<br />
ironical situation.  He shook around a bit, gently, to wake
<br />
Sally.  She remained in a dazed state, not reacting to his
<br />
motion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog decided to test another tactic. He rotated his
<br />
body so that his front would be in contact with Sally's head,
<br />
and positioned her head on his upper abdominal area.  This time,
<br />
he tried shaking her a little more forcefully and whispering
<br />
into her ear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, Sally, it's me.  Remember, your best bud, Sonic?&quot; he
<br />
said softly, and waited for a few seconds.  The results were not
<br />
very encouraging.  She seemed like she was coming out of her
<br />
dream world, but she needed just a little more encouragement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'OK, Hedgehog.  What now?' Sonic thought to himself.  In
<br />
response, his brain produced a plan to give Sally the perfect
<br />
wake-up call.  He rose slowly, taking precautions not to let her
<br />
head become one with the mud pool.  He slowly pulled her over to
<br />
the mud mound, and carefully placed her head on it.  No further
<br />
response from that, but Sonic wasn't finished yet.  After he put
<br />
her head on the mud mound, he tried to locate Nicole.  After
<br />
about a minute of feeling around Sally's legs and feet, he found
<br />
Nicole still attached to one of her boots.  Picking Nicole off
<br />
her boot and out of the mud, Sonic observed the small computer's
<br />
condition.  She was, expectedly, drenched with the products of
<br />
broken shells and organic excretions of calcium carbonate, but
<br />
would she still work?  He tried brushing her off, but belatedly
<br />
realized that using his hands to remove the mud from Nicole was
<br />
about as useful as drying a wet floor with water.  The hedgehog
<br />
then decided to test which hypothesis was correct.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Nicole,&quot; he commanded to the small computer.  Nicole
<br />
trilled in response.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT woke Sally up, and with an energetic efficiency.  A
<br />
powerful force swelled through her body, providing an intensity
<br />
similar to moving through air, as if the restrictive carbonate
<br />
mud didn't exist.  She leaped out of the mud as fast as she
<br />
could, and slowly paced over to Sonic like someone with murder
<br />
on her mind.  She stared into his eyes with an intense, and
<br />
borderline dangerous regard for his future welfare.  Which, in
<br />
this case, didn't hold much in favor for Sonic.  If Sonic had
<br />
the mind-set to see the humor in the situation, he would have
<br />
noticed that Sally looked as if she tried to get a little too
<br />
much mud out of her mud pack.  All the normally jovial hedgehog
<br />
could see now were Sally's eyes, vicious and full of primordial
<br />
anger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What...are...you...doing...to...NICOLE?!&quot; she demanded, like a
<br />
mother crocodile accosting an unfortunate predator intent on
<br />
feasting on her young.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic slowly backed off, his own eyes pleading for mercy.
<br />
&quot;Whoa, Sal.  Chill a minute!&quot; he ventured, his voice a little
<br />
slurred with the surprise that one of his closest friends would
<br />
ever attack him like this.  Suddenly regaining his generally
<br />
frolicsome mood, but only halfway, he said half-jokingly and
<br />
half-seriously, &quot;Man, you redheads sure are cranky when you wake
<br />
up in the morning.  Definitely not cool, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last comment from Sonic tamed Sally's precarious mood.  She
<br />
stopped strutting toward him, and a smile gradually crept across
<br />
her face as she seemed to consider exactly what danger Sonic
<br />
could be to Nicole's electronics.  She sat down, looked at
<br />
herself and the hedgehog, noticing that they were both covered
<br />
up to the neck with mud.  She laughed hysterically at the sight
<br />
for about a minute, as she thought about how an oversized mud
<br />
pack and a hedgehog would look together.  Sonic was about as
<br />
anyone could get to that level of contact, and so was she.  The
<br />
hedgehog could only stare at her, unsettled by the response.  It
<br />
wasn't exactly the one he wanted, but it would have to do for
<br />
now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if realizing the effect she had on her friend, Sally stopped
<br />
laughing, but her face softened to a considerate grin instead of
<br />
a more serious regard.  She stood up, and walked slowly over to
<br />
Sonic.  Anyone else would say that her strut, her facial
<br />
expression, and of course being covered in mud made her seem
<br />
like she was attempting to be seductive.  But Sonic knew Sally
<br />
better than that.  She enveloped him in a caressing embrace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; she said softly while stroking his upper torso,
<br />
&quot;didn't I tell you to be more careful when you try out those mud
<br />
packs?  What do you do with them anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not intent on spoiling the humor, Sonic was quick to respond.
<br />
&quot;Sal,&quot; he said in a voice as soft as what Sally used, &quot;even
<br />
hedgehogs need a little beauty work done every once in a while.
<br />
Besides, I think I got a hold of Dulcy's by mistake.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but don't you think it was time you-&quot;  She stopped
<br />
herself, as if remembering something.  Her face hardened to a
<br />
serious and thoughtful one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, realizing what significance one particular word in her
<br />
sentence had, followed suit.  They both disengaged their embrace
<br />
simultaneously, and slowly descended.  They sat and stared at
<br />
each other, both thinking of the ramifications of their
<br />
situation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog asked the obvious, but necessary, question.
<br />
&quot;Sal,&quot; he queried, &quot;where are we?&quot;  Slightly off the mark.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally corrected him.  &quot;It's not a question of WHERE, Sonic.
<br />
It's more like WHEN.  From the looks of things, we could've been
<br />
transported forward or back in time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do we find out when, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought the matter over.  Then she remembered something
<br />
about one of the new sensors Bookshire had told her about.  She
<br />
relayed the data to Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I'm not mistaken, Bookshire installed a temporal
<br />
displacement sensor in Nicole.  She might be able to tell us
<br />
where in time we are.&quot;  She added privately in her thoughts, 'I
<br />
hope.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic handed Nicole over to Sally.  She retrieved her little
<br />
computer, and quickly analyzed the condition of its
<br />
functionality.  Aside from the test that Sonic had done, she
<br />
checked Nicole via her diagnostics programs.  The results were
<br />
favorable:  covered in mud, but otherwise capable of running
<br />
programs and displaying data via her screen or holographic
<br />
projector. Nicole had been constructed well, and was meant to be
<br />
more than an aesthetic ornament.  The aesthetics could wait, for
<br />
the two Freedom Fighters had more important concerns.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole,&quot; Sally directed, &quot;calculate the total time
<br />
differential between the time period right before the transport
<br />
phase and now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Working,&quot; the computer responded, &quot;connection has been
<br />
established with temporal singularity.&quot;  After a second of
<br />
processing pieces of complex data, Nicole resolved them into
<br />
understandable temporal dynamics graphs.  &quot;Approximate time of
<br />
transport:  3.8 billion years delta-t positive relative to our
<br />
time period.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After hearing about how long they have been lost in limbo
<br />
between the two time periods (relative to realspace), both
<br />
dropped their jaws with shock.  A million years was
<br />
incomprehensible enough, but the time that had spanned since the
<br />
fateful day of their temporal displacement defied every level of
<br />
understanding.  Many geologic events (major and minor) can
<br />
potentially take place in a decade, in some cases even a year.
<br />
3.8 billion years leaves many opportunities for anything to
<br />
happen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, with this span of displacement in time travel,
<br />
everything that they once had was gone a long time ago and
<br />
decomposed to dust.  All the familiar sights, sounds, personal
<br />
relations, and other things that were generally taken for
<br />
granted no longer existed.  In this time period, they were the
<br />
aliens, and Nature generally had ways with dispatching of
<br />
organic components that weren't part of the whole.  If they
<br />
stayed in this time period, there was a likelihood that they
<br />
wouldn't find the food they needed to survive, or shelter for
<br />
their exclusive use.  Staying here would be a death sentence;
<br />
returning to their time period was imperative.  That was
<br />
assuming that doing so was possible in the first place;  there
<br />
was no guarantee to the process even existing in the first place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally started crying when she finally considered the immensity
<br />
of their dilemma, and how everyone else wasn't present to keep
<br />
them company.  She thought of Tails, Bunny, Dulcy, Rotor,
<br />
Bookshire, Charles Hedgehog, and even Antoine.  The opportunity
<br />
to meet other Freedom Fighters was also out of the question.  It
<br />
was as if time was against them, and that statement was no
<br />
further from the truth than now.  Sonic noticed the unrest that
<br />
was present in his companion, so he went over to embrace her.
<br />
She said nothing, but she returned the embrace.  They both
<br />
understood what they were feeling, for they were both in the
<br />
same situation.  Both tried to think of ways to comfort the
<br />
other, but they also understood that words had no ultimate value
<br />
here.  They were alone for now, and nothing in the universe
<br />
could change that.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighting back tears of his own, Sonic said to Sally in a gentle
<br />
voice, &quot;Sal, how 'bout we go find someplace else to go?  I don't
<br />
really like the idea of sleeping in a mud pit.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally struggled to speak, and succeeded.  &quot;You're right,&quot; she
<br />
said, sniffling with extreme grief.  &quot;Yes, it would be a good
<br />
idea to find shelter.&quot;  She added slightly jokingly, &quot;Besides,
<br />
we already had our mud bath for the day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both managed to find humor in that statement, and reacted
<br />
accordingly.  With a new immediate purpose to meet, they set
<br />
about finding an area that was somewhat more solid, not to
<br />
mention less offensive to the olfactory nerves.  Before they
<br />
began their trek for a provisional residence, Sally left a
<br />
remote multipurpose sensor/transponder, in order to monitor the
<br />
temporal singularity.  With a little help from Nicole, they
<br />
located solid ground about six km due north.  Given the fact
<br />
that the mud was about half as viscous as MegaMuck, Sonic had
<br />
some difficulty trying to get through, but he could manage.
