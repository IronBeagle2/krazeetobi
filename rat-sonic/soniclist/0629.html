&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just realized, after writing my last story, that I &quot;wrote myself into a
<br />
corner,&quot; so to speak. &quot;Pangolin Problems&quot; takes place just before the last
<br />
&quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; episode of the second season.  This leaves no room for
<br />
another story.  My only choice was to write something that comes before or
<br />
after it.  I dare not write anything that I don't know about.  If I had
<br />
written a post-Doomsday story, Murphy's Law dictates that Archie would
<br />
release an issue that contradicts everything that I wrote.  So here's my
<br />
latest story, a kind of prologue.  Keep in mind that this story takes place
<br />
two years before my last one and all the characters were roboticized.  (Or
<br />
not...)
<br />
Anyways, enjoy.

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Every time I try to get rid of that hedgehog,&quot; lectured Robotnik, &quot;EVERY
<br />
TIME, Snively, he finds a way out of it!  Well NOT this time!  THIS time he
<br />
is mine!&quot;  Robotnik held up a small test tube of a clear liquid.  &quot;See this,
<br />
Snively?  This is the key to success!  It's too bad, though.  I always hoped
<br />
to roboticize the little rodent.  This will have to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his hand, Robotnik held a few nanites, microscopic robots literally
<br />
build atom by atom.  They could infect a living being with ease, then it's
<br />
just a matter of self-replication until there are enough of them to kill
<br />
their host off.  All he had to do was release them into the atmosphere.  If
<br />
one nanite can replicate itself in a fifteen minutes, it can produce a
<br />
population of eight hundred trillion hundred trillion nanites (1 blossoms
<br />
into 79,228,162,514,300,000,000,000,000,000) in a single day, considering
<br />
that each nanite built can build more.  There are more than enough raw
<br />
materials to build these replicated nanites from, the dirt.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's nanites had but two functions, reproduce and infect any living
<br />
thing that was not him or Snively.  Once inside a being, the nanites would
<br />
simply attack the body, which would try to defend itself from this foreign
<br />
invasion.  To the host, it would feel exactly like they had the flu, a
<br />
fever, loss of energy, only once infected, there was no cure--they were
<br />
going to die.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hardly a typical day for the inhabitants of Knothole villiage--if
<br />
there is a &quot;typical&quot; day.  It seems like there's always something happening.
<br />
But not today, nothing was happening today.  Nobody was going after
<br />
Robotnik, nobody was testing new inventions, nobody was practicing their
<br />
martial arts, nobody was cooking.  Absolute zero.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still pretty cold outside, a thin layer of snow covered most of
<br />
the ground.  Patches of grass could be seen here and there.  It was that
<br />
time when it was too cold to go outside, but there wasn't enough snow to do
<br />
anything even if you wanted to go outside.  Everybody was stuck in their
<br />
huts until the weather got better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine was the only one who kept busy.  He was polishing his boots--for
<br />
the fourth time.  That was the only thing left for him to do, his room was
<br />
perfect in every detail.  After he finished, he sat down on his couch.
<br />
Almost immediately, he realized what he had done.  He stood up, brushed off
<br />
the couch, and fixed the pillows.  Then he started to polish his boots
<br />
again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic paced around his hut.  He was getting extremely impatient.  There
<br />
was just too much energy locked up inside him.  Every once in a while, he'd
<br />
stop, look around the hut for something to do, find nothing, and continue
<br />
pacing.  There was nothing left to do.  This was one of the few times that
<br />
he actually hoped Robotnik was up to something.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy was probably worse off than the rest.  She was a dragon, she was
<br />
supposed to fly.  But it was freezing!  And where would she go?  She was
<br />
bored and frustrated at the same time.  She sighed, got up out of bed, and
<br />
looked out the window.  She could see Sonic pacing around his hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny sat and read.  She had already read this book, but at least it was
<br />
something to do.  Tomorrow she'd be finished and reading another book she
<br />
already read.  Every few chapters, she'd find herself thinking of Rotor, but
<br />
that's another story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor could not be more bored.  He had &quot;inventor's block.&quot;  There was
<br />
nothing to invent, and nothing to fix.  There wasn't even something to
<br />
improve upon.  He looked around his lab, straining to find something to do,
<br />
but failed.  He secretly wished that something would go wrong with one of
<br />
Bunny's robotic limbs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire wasn't THAT bored.  He was used to staying at Knothole.
<br />
Because of his leg, he was in no condition to go on a mission to
<br />
Robotropolis.  Even so, most of the time he was able to help his friends by
<br />
remote communication.  The only thing he could do now was monitor the
<br />
Robotropolis Main Computer Core to see what was up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails stared out the window, not looking at anything in particular.  He
<br />
was lost in thought and would only snap out of it when the window got fogged
<br />
up because of his getting too close to it.  He'd try to think of something
<br />
to do when his thoughts would wander and the next he knew, he couldn't see
<br />
out the window.  He sat down on his bed and stared at the ceiling, letting
<br />
his thoughts wander from there.  There just wasn't anything to do!  He got
<br />
up and paced around the room, but soon found himself back at the window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Sally was in the room with him, keeping an eye on him.  There
<br />
was no reason to do so.  The only way Tails could possibly hurt himself is
<br />
by cutting himself on a piece of glass as he tried to escape this insanely
<br />
boring situation.  She looked down at Nicole, then at Tails, then at some
<br />
books.  She was just about to offer to read a story to Tails when she
<br />
remembered that they had all been read.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last two days were spent like this, nothing to do but trying to find
<br />
something to do, until one day, Sonic got sick.  It wasn't unusual at the
<br />
time, even speedy hedgehogs get sick once in a while.  Besides, it was cold
<br />
out.  Sally attended to him and everything was back to normal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that same day, Sally got sick.  Dulcy also.  Sally first thought
<br />
that she had caught Sonic's illness, probably just a cold, but symptoms in
<br />
a matter of hours?  And what about Dulcy?  She was in her hut all this time,
<br />
no where near Sonic.  Sally decided to consult Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's probably just a coincidence,&quot; explained Bookshire.  &quot;But if it
<br />
makes you feel better, I'll investigate.  You say Sonic got sick this
<br />
afternoon?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  He came into my hut complaining about a fever.  I took him back
<br />
to his hut and took his temperature.  Nicole reported a mild one, nothing
<br />
to be worried about.  I asked Antoine to cook up some soup and gave it to
<br />
Sonic.  He said he'd be fine, so I left.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And now you're sick?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Same symptoms?  Mild temperature?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nodded again.  &quot;A little lower than Sonic's but I'm sure that's just
<br />
because I took it early.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It sounds to me like the flu, but let's check on Sonic.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gaaaaabriel!&quot; a voice called from somewhere outside.  &quot;Gaaaaabe!&quot;  The
<br />
door burst open.  &quot;I thought I'd find you in here,&quot; a young, female paca
<br />
came in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My god, woman!&quot; Williams exclaimed, getting out of his chair.  &quot;Have you
<br />
gone crazy!?!  Close that door!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She fulfilled his request.  &quot;Your room is always so messy,&quot; she said,
<br />
picking up a stack of books.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you doing now?  I've told you before, however 'messy' this room
<br />
gets, just leave it.&quot;  He didn't think his room was messy.  It wasn't
<br />
really, not to the point where cockroaches and rats scavenge for food left
<br />
on the floor.  It just had technical books and electronic parts strewn about
<br />
wherever there was room.  &quot;I know exactly where everything is.  When you
<br />
move something, I won't be able to find it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She put the books back.  &quot;What are you doing stuck in here, anyway?  You
<br />
should come outside.  It's a lovely day!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is not even close to being 'lovely' outside.  Computer, how cold is
<br />
it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sixty-eight degrees,&quot; Williams' small computer reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, computer, outside.  How cold is it outside?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Forty degrees.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See?  It's ten--eight degrees above freezing.  Some animals can't
<br />
SURVIVE in this weather.&quot;  He sat back down.  &quot;And it's Williams.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it about your first name that you don't like?  I like it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not that I don't like it, it's just that the other guy is also
<br />
Gabriel.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, the 'other guy.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know who I'm talking about, the painter.  It's easier to
<br />
distinguish between the two of us if you call me Williams and him Gabriel.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why don't I call him by his last name and you by your first?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know......  Just call me Williams, okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Painter,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;Robotnik beware!  We have a painter!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't tease him like that.  I like his work.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I respect your opinion, but if he's going to paint something, the
<br />
least he could do is make it look like what he's painting.  You're a nurse,
<br />
that's good, nurses are good.  I'm a programmer, that's good, programmers
<br />
are good.  He's a painter.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat down on his bed, knowing the conversation was over.  &quot;What are
<br />
you working on now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah!&quot; he grinned and picked up his computer, forgetting all about the
<br />
painter.  &quot;It's done!  I just need to perfect it, get rid of some bugs, but
<br />
it's done!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What can you do now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have remote access to other terminals.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You really ought to get out more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll get out when it warms up, but until then, I'm staying right here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Suit yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat down next to her.  &quot;Listen Kristen,&quot; he said, and took her hand,
<br />
&quot;Jeez!  You're burning up!&quot;  He felt her forehead.  &quot;You're staying right
<br />
here!  How can you NOT be cold?  I'll get the doctor.&quot;  He left the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams had the &quot;luck&quot; of getting stuck with too many snobby, yet
<br />
intelligent people.  A Doctor, nurse, painter, psychologist, physicist,
<br />
chemist, biologist, mathematician, and he the lowly computer hacker.  Some
<br />
of the villagers looked down upon him, but others, like Kristen, have
<br />
learned to like him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He arrived at the doctor's hut (it was just across from his) and knocked
<br />
on the door.  &quot;Helen!&quot;  He knocked again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the door.  &quot;What is it, Gabriel?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams.  Your daughter's sick.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right, you prefer Williams.  I prefer being addressed as 'Mrs. Taylor.'&quot;
<br />
They headed back to his hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother,&quot; said Kristen, &quot;I'm fine.  I'll just drink more fluids and
<br />
everything will be okay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're going to need some antibiotics.  Take some of this,&quot; prescribed
<br />
Mrs. Taylor.  She took a small bottle out of a bag she brought from her hut
<br />
and poured some of the thick liquid into a cup.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen drank the foul-tasting liquid.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll be fine, just stay in bed and take your medicine.  Now let's go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both the women left Williams to his debugging.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother!&quot; scolded Kristen after they were both inside their hut.  &quot;Please
<br />
don't act like that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just because he didn't come from one of the richest families in
<br />
Mobitropolis doesn't mean you can treat him like that!  His parents were
<br />
roboticized, Mother!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't want him to get involved in our lives.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As I remember it, we got involved in his.  He was one of the first ones
<br />
here, remember?  Besides, we don't have much of a choice.  It's a small
<br />
village and we're going to be here a while.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is wonderful!  Don't you agree Snively?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;  He didn't particularly like the idea of Robotnik and himself
<br />
being the only two living things on the entire planet.  But he couldn't do
<br />
anything about it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In a few more days, the world will be mine!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you never went outside for the past few days?&quot; questioned Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope,&quot; answered Sonic.  &quot;And I'm itchin' to get out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's not very likely.  Your fever is getting worse.  I don't have much
<br />
but this should do for now.&quot;  He administered a dose of medicine to Sonic.
<br />
&quot;Let's just hope nobody else gets sick.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems they didn't hope enough.  By the next morning, almost everybody
<br />
in the village was sick.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm willing to believe it's more than the flu,&quot; said Bookshire, also
<br />
sick.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what could spread this fast?&quot;  Sally was feeling horrible, but she
<br />
HAD to know what was going on.  &quot;And why isn't the medicine working?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not quite sure, could I borrow Nicole?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gave her computer to Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole, analyze Sally's blood, scan for anything abnormal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Foreign bodies found,&quot; reported Nicole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you identify them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  They are nanites from the roboticizer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Roboticizer?&quot;  Sally was confused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently,&quot; explained Bookshire, &quot;Robotnik reprogrammed his nanites to
<br />
infect us.  We're obviously not being roboticized.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can we stop them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the hard part.  We'd have to build some kind of a antiroboticizer
<br />
that can get rid of them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That could take days!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More like months.  You just got sick fifteen hours ago.  Considering
<br />
your condition, I'd say nobody in this village will live longer than
<br />
another two days.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally just looked at him, then began to cry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He held her head on his shoulder.  &quot;It'll be okay.  We'll figure
<br />
something out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about Tails?&quot; she sobbed.  &quot;He's only eight years old!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you help me, we might be able to find some other way to 'cure' this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She continued to cry, but eventually calmed down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, I want you to get Rotor, he can help us, and whatever you do,
<br />
don't tell anybody.  The last thing we need is the entire, panicked village
<br />
on our hands.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally left to go find Rotor and arrived with him a few minutes later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally said you wanted to see me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know anything about nanites?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A little.  Not enough to roboticize somebody.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How would you go about programming one?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess it would have to be done chemically, they're too small for a
<br />
disc.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what I was afraid of.  We have a lot of work to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four of them worked as fast as they could,  trying to figure out the
<br />
nanites' technology.  Once they learned how to program it, it was a simple
<br />
matter of telling Nicole to deactivate them all.  But, alas, they worked
<br />
non-stop for the next thirty-seven hours to no avail.  They were all tired
<br />
and getting weaker by the minute (besides Nicole).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry, Sally,&quot; Bookshire's voice was hoarse, &quot;but there's nothing
<br />
more I can do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I'm going to die, there's some things I have to do first.&quot;  Sally
<br />
left.  It sounded like she finally accepted that she was going to die.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anything you want to do, Rotor?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not enough time.&quot;  He kept working, but in the back of his mind he knew
<br />
that it didn't matter what he did.  The only reason he worked was to keep
<br />
his mind off impending death.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally went to Sonic's hut.  She found him awake in his bed.  He turned to
<br />
look at her as she came in.  She walked over to Sonic, passionately kissed
<br />
him, and then left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sat there for a while, stunned, then confused.  &quot;Sal must be
<br />
getting delirious,&quot; he thought to himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, Sally visited Tails.  &quot;Do you feel okay?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine, Aunt Sally.&quot;  He could barely talk.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry, Tails.&quot;  She sat down next to him on his bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I couldn't find the cure in time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You did your best.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, but it's not fair.  It's just not fair.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was one of the last to get sick.  He realized the medicine Mrs.
<br />
Taylor gave everybody was not working at all.  &quot;Computer, what illness do I
<br />
have?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;None.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Another bug,&quot; he said to himself.  &quot;Computer, what is wrong with me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, there is something in my body making me sick, what is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They are Nanites.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nanites?  That's all?  Computer, what are they programmed to do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unknown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, yeah.  They don't run on electrical impulses.  Okay, here.&quot;  He slid
<br />
open a small slot on the side of his computer and put a drop of his blood on
<br />
it, then pushed it back in.  &quot;Computer, pick a nanite, any nanite, and find
<br />
out how it works.  Tell me when you're done.&quot;  He waited for a while.
<br />
&quot;Computer, how long is this going to take?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Approximately three hours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned.  But sure enough, three hours later his computer had
<br />
learned to control a nanite.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, what are the nanites programmed to do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They are programmed to infect any living thing except two select
<br />
individuals, then kill their host.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who are the two individuals that they won't infect?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DNA unknown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Probably Robotnik and Snively.  Now, computer, pick any ten nanites and
<br />
have them deactivate themselves.  But before they deactivate, have them
<br />
pick ten nanites each and tell the nanites they picked to do the same.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one or two seconds, depending on how many nanites there were, they
<br />
were all deactivated.  It was a simple as that.  Everybody infected would
<br />
slowly get better.  The nanites weren't killing them anymore and that gave
<br />
their bodies a chance to heal.  The &quot;dead&quot; nanites would soon leave the
<br />
body, through one of various ways.  But Williams had bigger ideas.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The citizens of Knothole slowly began to feel better and better.  Nobody
<br />
knew exactly what had happened, but they were alive and that was all that
<br />
mattered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saw Sally on her way to Bookshire's hut and ran up next to her.
<br />
&quot;So Sal...&quot; he said, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't want to talk about it, Sonic Hedgehog.  I was going to die, it
<br />
was a spontaneous thing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right, Sal.  Whatever you say.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was!  I just--  This conversation is over.&quot;  She opened the door to
<br />
Bookshire's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, It's good to see you again.  You should be dead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where's Rotor?  I came to thank both of you.  What did you two do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing.  I was supposed to be dead also.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait......  You're saying the nanites just gave up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, and let's hope it stays like that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It puzzled both of them.  The nanites had them licked, why did they give
<br />
up?  Sally didn't think about it any more, she was just glad it was over.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams walked over to Kristen's hut with a vial of some clear liquid.
<br />
He knocked on the door and patiently waited for her to answer.  Mrs. Taylor
<br />
answered instead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I brought a gift for your wonderful daughter,&quot; he said, holding up the
<br />
vial.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Water?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well......yeah.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kristen!&quot; she called.  &quot;Your little 'friend' has brought you some
<br />
water!&quot;  She went back inside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen came out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Feeling better?&quot; asked Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I guess so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams explained why.  He had proof if he needed it, but Kristen
<br />
believed him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You have to tell everybody!&quot;  She was very excited.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I will, later.  But first, I brought you this.&quot;  He handed her the vial
<br />
of water.  &quot;Drink it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smelt it and looked at him as if it was some sort of poison.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go ahead, drink it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did, but nothing happened.  It tasted exactly like water.  She didn't
<br />
feel any different.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are now immune to about ninety-nine point nine percent of all
<br />
diseases and your mother is out of a job.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at him in disbelief.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm serious.  You just drank about a thousand nanites.  Now that they're
<br />
inside your body, they'll replicate themselves until a stable population
<br />
is reached and keep you healthy.  They'll even slow your growing old.  Not
<br />
by much, though, I'm still working on that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's great!&quot;  She kissed him on the cheek.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah...well...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You should give some to everyone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, no.  Only a select few get the nanites.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who have you 'chosen?'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The only person I can trust.  Nanites are a curse as well as a blessing.
<br />
Whoever controls the nanites, controls the person they inhabit.  I could
<br />
kill you right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked at him, surprised at what he just said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know me better than that.  Anyway, the only person I can trust here
<br />
is Adam.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You TRUST him?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He may be unpredictable and he may have locked me out of my computer a
<br />
few times, but he knows what he's doing.  I trust him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then why did you give the nanites to me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because you're my friend and everybody knows that scientists give their
<br />
discoveries to their friends before releasing them to the general public.
<br />
So, now that being a nurse is obsolete, you want to learn a bit about
<br />
computers?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess I should.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  And don't worry about Adam.  If he even THINKS of screwing with
<br />
your nanites, I'll help him out.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End...
<br />
