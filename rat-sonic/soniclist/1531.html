&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 11
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't lose him, Snively!  I must have him!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Easy for you to say,&quot; Snively muttered under his breath,
<br />
&quot;you're not driving.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was moving with a speed and agility he had never known
<br />
before.  Somehow, though, it all seemed so natural -- as if he
<br />
had been born to do the impossible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was able to keep up a grueling pace and not feel any
<br />
fatigue.  He zigged and zagged down streets and up alleys,
<br />
doubled back and slipped under conduits and bridges.  He didn't
<br />
want to slow down, not only because it might have meant his
<br />
capture, but also because it felt so good to run.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively, however, managed to stay on the young hedgehog's
<br />
trail.  He took some corners a little too sharply and he and
<br />
Robotnik got knocked about in the process.  Robotnik, however,
<br />
kept his attention on the blue blur visible ahead of them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa, this looks interesting,&quot; Sonic thought as he found
<br />
himself heading down a side street which turned into a dead end. 
<br />
An enormous skyscraper marked the end of the street.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have him now, Snively!  He's got nowhere else to go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nowhere except up, Sir.  Look!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough, Sonic wasn't about to let a little thing like a
<br />
building stand in his way.  He was on a roll and he just kept on
<br />
rolling.  He was running up the side of the building, propelled
<br />
by momentum.  Snively put the hover unit into a climb in the nick
<br />
of time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After him, after him!  If that ring can enable him to do
<br />
THAT....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was halfway up the building when he looked over his
<br />
shoulder.  Robotnik was keeping pace.  &quot;Man, this is getting
<br />
boring!&quot; he thought.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the blink of an eye, Sonic reversed directions and was
<br />
running down the side of the building.  He blew Robotnik a
<br />
raspberry as he passed the hover unit.  Snively quickly turned it
<br />
around.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're gaining, Snively!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, they were closing in on Sonic.  They were almost on
<br />
top of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then, about fifty feet from the ground, that Sonic
<br />
decided that he had better stop coasting and do some serious
<br />
running.  He pounded ahead, reached the ground and streaked away.
<br />
The hover unit, however, was in virtual free fall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pull up, Snively!  PULL UP!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively worked the controls, but the underside of the hover
<br />
unit scraped the street.  That was enough to sent the hover unit
<br />
tumbling with all the aerodynamics of a stone skipping across a
<br />
pond.  By the time the hover unit came to rest its shell was
<br />
pocked and torn, its windows were smashed, and its contents badly
<br />
shaken.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively,&quot; Robotnik panted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y-yes, Sir?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have decided that I am going to make it one of the
<br />
supreme goals of my life to GET THAT HEDGEHOG!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively rolled his eyes.  This did NOT sound like a
<br />
worthwhile job description.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic raced back to the dump, where the others were gathered
<br />
at their pre-arranged rendezvous point: the excavated remains of
<br />
the slide.  &quot;Man, you shoulda seen ol' Buttnik eat my dust!  I
<br />
was...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, not now!&quot; Sally cut him off.  &quot;Get down!&quot;  It was
<br />
only then that Sonic noticed that the others were lying prone on
<br />
the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nap time already?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, Rotor thinks that that ring unit is going to blow
<br />
up!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's overheating and going unstable,&quot; Rotor added.  I
<br />
couldn't get the power stone out and...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean that stone thingie is still in there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course, we....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chill, guys.&quot;  And before anyone could say or do anything,
<br />
Sonic took off toward Uncle Chuck's.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are we to be doing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What CAN we do, Antoine?&quot; Sally asked.  &quot;Sonic's gotten too
<br />
fast for....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything else Sally might have said was drowned out by a
<br />
deafening roar as the power ring unit exploded.  In moments, the
<br />
home of Sir Charles Hedgehog was engulfed in flames.  The
<br />
children stared at it silently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic?&quot; Tails said in a hesitant voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's my name, don't wear it out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children turned.  There standing behind them, the power
<br />
stone on the ground at his feet, was Sonic.  Tails yelped and
<br />
threw his arms around Sonic's neck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!?  How did you...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No biggie, Sal.  I just yanked it out of there real fast. 
<br />
And from now on, &quot;fast&quot; is my middle name!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is what I was to be saying,&quot; Antoine sputtered, &quot;about
<br />
your unresponsibility and your utter fuelishness and your....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine never got to finish his sentence as Sally touched
<br />
him on the shoulder.  For now they could all see that Sonic's
<br />
demeanor had changed.  He might have been careless when it came
<br />
to putting his life on the line, but it was a more subdued Sonic
<br />
who watched his Uncle Chuck's house -- the only home he had ever
<br />
known before Knothole -- being consumed by fire.  They watched
<br />
for several silent seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on,&quot; Sonic said quietly.  &quot;Let's go home.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children were subdued and apprehensive as they entered
<br />
the Great Forest.  But the farther they made their way, the
<br />
louder and more animatedly they talked about what they had just
<br />
done.  All except Tails who quickly succumbed to fatigue.  Sonic
<br />
carried the cub in his arms the rest of the way back to Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also speculated as to what would happen to them if
<br />
Rosie or Julayla ever found out.  They each thought that they
<br />
would be severely punished if either of the grown-ups found out
<br />
about their experience, but they also all agreed that any
<br />
punishment would be totally worth it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was about two hours before dawn as the children neared
<br />
Knothole.  As they recognized that they were getting closer to
<br />
Knothole, the children fell silent.  Their luck had held in that
<br />
they were able to get away undetected.  If they could just get
<br />
back and into bed before Rosie or Julayla learned of it, they
<br />
would be home free.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They edged toward the clearing.  So far, so good: there were
<br />
no lights on in any of the cabins.  The children all made their
<br />
way into the nearest cabin, which was Sonic's and Tails'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's Tails doing, Sonic?&quot; Sally whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The big guy's still asleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah can't see a thing, Sal.  Think we can take a chance on
<br />
lightin' a candle?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had she whispered these words than there was a
<br />
hiss and a burst of light as someone at the far end of the room
<br />
struck a match.  The children froze as its light momentarily
<br />
dimmed, then the light grew stronger as someone had lit a candle
<br />
with it.  That someone was Julayla.  She calmly blew out the
<br />
match; the children each caught the smell of burnt sulfur. 
<br />
Julayla stood up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Julayla, I...&quot; Sally began.  Julayla raised her hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There'll be time enough for talk in the morning,&quot; she said
<br />
quietly, as she took the sleeping Tails in her arms and began
<br />
putting him to bed.  Rotor, Antoine and the girls silently
<br />
drifted away.  Sonic wanted to say something to Julayla, but
<br />
couldn't.  Julayla didn't say anything to Sonic as she let the
<br />
cabin.  That silent reproach hurt Sonic almost as much as
<br />
watching his old home go up in flames.
<br />
<br /><br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 12
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the early hour at which the children had gone to
<br />
bed, nobody slept in that morning.  They all gathered in front of
<br />
the dining hall but didn't go in, except for Tails.  He was as
<br />
buoyant as ever as he raced from his hut.  He even flew half
<br />
the distance to the dining hall, since he figured that the secret
<br />
was out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, SOMEONE's in a good mood,&quot; Bunnie observed gloomily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What to you think they'll do to us?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know,&quot; Sally said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe it won't be so bad,&quot; Sonic suggested.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right, Sonic,&quot; Sally shot back, &quot;we only broke every rule
<br />
in the book and then some!  Well, let's get this over with,&quot; she
<br />
added as she walked toward the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they entered the dining hall, Tails was already seated at
<br />
a table with Julayla.  Rotor volunteered to walk as close to
<br />
their table as possible, in order to hear what was being said. 
<br />
He heard Tails happily recounting the events of the previous
<br />
evening in one long run-on sentence:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...and then Sonic seen us when he came outside and Sally
<br />
said for him to run so he runned away but real real fast and....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, how is it?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's bad, guys,&quot; Rotor said as he sat down at the table
<br />
with the others.  &quot;I was listening to Tails just now.  He's
<br />
telling Julayla everything that happened last night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's Julayla taking it?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails was making all kinds of grammatical errors, but
<br />
Julayla didn't even stop and correct him once!&quot;  He put his head
<br />
in his hands.  &quot;That's it: we're toast!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How are you to be thinking of food at the time like this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was in no mood to say anything to Antoine just then,
<br />
because they saw Julayla walking toward them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Miles has told me what happened last night.  Does anyone
<br />
wish to add anything?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I do,&quot; Sally said, her head bowed.  &quot;We should have trusted
<br />
you, and told you and Rosie that Tails was missing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Sal,&quot; Sonic immediately said, &quot;they'd have grounded us
<br />
and we wouldn't have gotten Tails back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps, perhaps not,&quot; Julayla said calmly.  &quot;But now
<br />
you'll never know, will you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was enough to overwhelm Sonic's attempt at argument. 
<br />
While he and the other children contemplated this reply, Julayla
<br />
went to the side cupboard where the school supplies were kept. 
<br />
She returned with paper and writing instruments.  Sonic and the
<br />
others anticipated that they'd each have to write something long
<br />
and chastening one hundred times.  Just for starters.  As the
<br />
children passed the materials around to each other, Julayla began
<br />
unfolding large old documents: they were maps of Mobotropolis.   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I want each of you to study the maps that I've spread out
<br />
on the table.  Write out any changes in the city that you
<br />
noticed last night.  Be as detailed as possible.  You'll probably
<br />
want to compare notes with each other.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What kind of crazy punishment is THIS?&quot; Sonic whispered to
<br />
Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is not your punishment, Sonic.  You've already brought
<br />
a very severe punishment upon yourselves.  Until yesterday,
<br />
Robotnik had probably forgotten all about you; today, he knows
<br />
better and you've given him a reason to look for you.  Yesterday
<br />
you were children playing a game; as of today, you are in a war. 
<br />
There is no worse punishment that I or anyone else could possibly
<br />
inflict.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children looked at each other silently.  Bunnie looked
<br />
at Sally and silently mouthed the word &quot;war.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It'll be OK, Bunnie, as long as we work together,&quot; she said
<br />
softly.  Then, in a louder voice she spoke to the others, &quot;OK,
<br />
where did the trash heap begin?  We know that it covered all of
<br />
the playground where this park used to be....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally,&quot; Julayla added, &quot;your afternoon lessons will be held
<br />
in my hut.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children waited with anticipation around the pool just
<br />
outside Knothole.  Everyone, that is, except Rotor, who was
<br />
somewhere under the water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the exception of Rotor, none of the children
<br />
particularly cared for the water.  They could swim if they had
<br />
to, but there were more at home on the land.  Especially Sonic,
<br />
who couldn't swim a stroke.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor suddenly broke the surface, getting a breath of air. 
<br />
The others shook the water from themselves.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stone's in, everybody!  The machine started right up!  If
<br />
it's the same as the machine in Uncle Chuck's workshop it should
<br />
be producing a power ring any time now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the other children gathered as close to the edge of the
<br />
pool as they dared, Julayla touched Sally on the shoulder.  The
<br />
two of them moved away from the group and walked toward Julayla's
<br />
hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, Julayla began writing something on a scrap of
<br />
paper which she then handed to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Commit this to memory.  When you have done so, burn it. 
<br />
Leave no trace.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?  What is this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is a list of four settlements of refugees from
<br />
Mobotropolis located in various parts of the Great Forest.  These
<br />
aren't their true locations: only the locations of drop sites
<br />
where we leave the messages by which we communicate with each
<br />
other.  We wanted to keep from jeopardizing all of the
<br />
settlements, so we devised this system.  It's a good thing we
<br />
did; one settlement, Birchwood, was discovered by SWATbots the
<br />
other day and its inhabitants scattered.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are others!?  But why...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why were you not told?  None knew of the existence of the
<br />
other camps except for one member of each, and even they did not
<br />
know the precise location of the others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what were they doing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Surviving.  Living in hiding.  Living in fear.  And
<br />
waiting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Waiting for what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Waiting for WHOM is more like it.  They have no one to
<br />
guide them, no one to formulate strategy and carry it out.  I
<br />
knew that the day would come when there would be a sign, a sign
<br />
that we can begin to hope again.  A sign that the time had come
<br />
to begin resisting Robotnik.  Your raid on Robotropolis last
<br />
night was reckless and uncoordinated, but it was also the sign
<br />
that I and the others had been waiting for.  It was the sign that
<br />
we finally have a leader amongst us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julayla walked over to Sally and placed her hands on the
<br />
girl's shoulders.  Things got very still and cold inside the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly they heard the sound of cheering outside.  The
<br />
machinery at the bottom of the pool had indeed produced a power
<br />
ring.  With ring in hand, Sonic was tearing up the turf of
<br />
Knothole.  He was just a blur as he streaked around and between
<br />
the buildings.  And as he ran, the other children began chanting
<br />
his name: &quot;So-NIC!  So-NIC!  So-NIC!  So-NIC!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Julayla watched Sonic's dashing about.  Then Sally
<br />
spoke, with a startling bitterness in her voice: &quot;Yes, you've got
<br />
your leader....&quot; She said no more, choked back a sob, then ran
<br />
from the hut.  She ran across Sonic's path, and the sight managed
<br />
to bring the hedgehog to a halt.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chill, guys,&quot; he said to the others, &quot;I'll be right back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic walked around the corner of a hut.  He saw Sally
<br />
seated on a log, her face buried in her hands and her shoulders
<br />
heaving.  He quietly sat down a little way from her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stopped crying and tried to adopt a formal appearance.
<br />
&quot;Tired of your adoring fans already?&quot; she asked sarcastically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sal, you got too much class for that kind of a cheap
<br />
shot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; she sniffled.  &quot;I...I guess I'm just scared.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scared of what?&quot;     
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, everything's changed now!  Julayla expects me to
<br />
start acting like some kind of leader...and I don't know if I
<br />
can.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What're you talking about, Sal?  We found Tails, got Uncle
<br />
Chuck's power ring machine working, AND got in and out of
<br />
Robotropolis in one piece!  And we did it as a team, thanks to
<br />
you.  All I did was run fast.  You're a GREAT leader!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But will the other Mobians feel that way?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what?&quot;  So Sally told Sonic about the other camps
<br />
hidden in the Great Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic we're talking about grown-ups here!  Even if I am the
<br />
heir to the throne, I'm still just a kid.  Do you really think
<br />
any grown-up would take orders from a ten-year-old girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic said it so simply and sincerely that it surprised both
<br />
of them.  For several moments all the two of them could do was
<br />
look at each other.  For Sonic, it was as if he were looking at
<br />
someone he'd never known before.  His hand slowly reached over
<br />
and took hold of hers...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the stillness of the moment was broken by a chorus
<br />
of hoots and whistles.  Bunnie, Rotor, Antoine and Tails were
<br />
looking at them from around the corner of one of the huts.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, man!  Knock it off, you guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's face grew bright red, and Sally adopted that studied
<br />
indifference which children sometimes mistake for maturity.  And
<br />
then the other four children began a traditional Mobian chant. 
<br />
It was a chant that further embarrassed Sonic and annoyed Sally,
<br />
though there was a secret part of her that was glad to hear it. 
<br />
It began:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic and Sally sittin' in a tree....&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE END
