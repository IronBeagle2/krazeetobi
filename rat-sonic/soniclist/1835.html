BLUE FLAMES
<br />
by Brent &quot;Hedgehog X&quot; Roberts and Thad &quot;X&quot; Boyd
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
LEGAL MUMBO-JUMBO
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work was written by Thad &quot;X&quot; Boyd and Brent &quot;Hedgehog X&quot;
<br />
Roberts, and belongs to them lock, stock, and barrel.  You are allowed to
<br />
have as many copies (electronic or hard-copy) as you want, and are
<br />
encouraged to show it to your friends, but you are not allowed to modify it
<br />
or make any money without their official consent (which you're never going
<br />
to get just by asking out of the blue, and probably not going to get
<br />
anyway, so don't even try).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make it easier to distinguish who wrote what, I've headed each
<br />
chapter with a different color - darker blue for what I wrote, lighter for
<br />
what he wrote.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any resemblance between characters in this story and any real
<br />
beings, living or dead, is purely coincidental, except in cases when the
<br />
character's personality is meant to represent his/her creator's.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I'd like to thank everyone who created characters included
<br />
in this story.  This includes Service and Games (SEGA), Archie Comic
<br />
Publications, DiC entertainment, Capcom games, and a whole bunch of present
<br />
and former (mostly the latter, unfortunately [fortunately, however, when
<br />
referring to 99.9% of Club X members, since John &quot;King Lawnmower&quot; Geddes
<br />
was the only one who I ever respected, and of course I didn't respect him
<br />
at the time]) members of Sonic '94/'95 and Club X (normally I'd include
<br />
names, but I can't remember them all, and besides, they'd take up too much
<br />
space anyway).  Some of the names of the Team X members may be from other
<br />
sources, but I'm not sure, since I never thought to ask my enemies where
<br />
they got their names.  The name &quot;Kumba&quot; is borrowed (yeah, borrowed, that's
<br />
the ticket) from the name of a ride at the Busch Gardens theme park in
<br />
Tampa, Florida.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd also like to thank Dave &quot;Bookshire&quot; Pistone for his wonderful
<br />
site, and for the creation of Packbell, who makes a brief appearance in the
<br />
new intro to this story.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
FOREWORD
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you are about to read is BLUE FLAMES, written by myself and my
<br />
esteemed colleague, Brent Roberts, in September of 1994.  The text is the
<br />
same (except for a few minor changes I've made to prevent incontinuity, and
<br />
you'd need an eagle eye to spot them), but I fixed spelling, punctuation,
<br />
and marginal errors.  Also, I've &quot;merged&quot; chapters #10 and #11 from the
<br />
original story, since #11 was basically just a retelling of #10, and the
<br />
two conflicted at one point anyway.  Also, I combined the original chapters
<br />
#13 and #14, into just chapter #12.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLUE FLAMES was an experiment; a crossover between our two ongoing
<br />
(at the time) storylines.  Part of it occurred in DA STORY -- BOOK 1: THE
<br />
SONIC SAGA -- ACT 7: THE TERRAN PLANET, by Brent, and the rest occurred in
<br />
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG MEETS MEGA MAN X -- BOOK 2: HEDGEHOG ZERO, by yours truly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was such a success that Brent and I decided to make another
<br />
crossover later, which we called DREAMS DISTORTED, but for various
<br />
technical reasons (i.e. Brent disappeared while it was being written, and
<br />
by the time he got back, our whole outline was ripped asunder because of
<br />
changes in the club's membership), it has been canned indefinitely (the
<br />
project may continue if I can figure out how to make important changes).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reasons for DD's cancellation bring up an interesting point
<br />
that applies to this story.  Our policy in the club's stories is for each
<br />
member to create a character to be included in stories, but of course,
<br />
because of Prodigy's outrageous pricing, these members disappear with an
<br />
alarming regularity (and now, let us all bow our heads in homage to the
<br />
recent loss of our friends Allen and Jill Quindiagan, who lost Prodigy just
<br />
a week or so before my writing this, but let's make the homage snappy,
<br />
because this is beginning to become one heck of a run-on sentence).
<br />
Because of this, there are many characters in here whose &quot;owners&quot; have
<br />
disappeared, yet the characters play such pivotal roles in the story, they
<br />
will return in future stories (MTP being a prime example, as you will find
<br />
when you read on).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't know who the third-party characters are, they all
<br />
(except MTP) appear in a story called JADED VIEWS...just keep in mind that
<br />
in this story, the Freedom Fighters don't know about Hedgehog X's past.
<br />
Also, some plot elements will be cleared up in future stories...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyhoo, the basic plot is that Hedgehog X was sent to Earth by
<br />
Robotnik in acts 5 and 6 of DA STORY (the exact events can be found in the
<br />
prologue, rewritten with a few new characters), and met up with and
<br />
befriended some robots there (although not quite himself at the time).
<br />
Meanwhile, the Freedom Fighters follow him to Terra to help, but Robotnik
<br />
has other ideas, and dispatches a new team of robots to stop them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, this story was written while Sonic '94 (the name for the
<br />
Prodigy Sonic club at the time) was encountering hard times with a rival
<br />
club called &quot;X&quot;.  The troubles were caused, in part, by me, who didn't
<br />
exactly take kindly to an unsavory club with my same nickname.  I admit I
<br />
overreacted a tad to what was going on, but I maintain that I DID ask them
<br />
NICELY to change their name or refrain from advertising in &quot;my&quot; domain, and
<br />
they replied immaturely (and I STILL have the printouts to prove it!).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that have to do with anything, you ask?  Well, several of
<br />
the villains herein are adapted from members of Club X, just so I can give
<br />
credit where credit's due.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I'd like to shamelessly plug some of my other Sonic
<br />
fan-fiction.  At the moment I'm writing this, a story written by my friend
<br />
Steve &quot;Maxl&quot; Tramer and me, entitled JADED VIEWS, can be found on Bookshire
<br />
Draftwood's homepage at <a href="HTTP://WWW.RAT.ORG/BOOKSHIRE">HTTP://WWW.RAT.ORG/BOOKSHIRE</a>.  Also, expect another
<br />
story of mine, THE HUNT BEGINS, to hit before the end of 1995 (that one has
<br />
less &quot;third-party&quot; characters than the others, I might add), and two new
<br />
storylines -- IGNITION FACTOR, by me, and THE 72 HOUR SERIES, by Steven
<br />
Tramer -- to appear throughout '96.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, if you have any questions or comments about any of my
<br />
stories, or just want to chat, write to me at AHVT94B_at_PRODIGY.COM.  Also,
<br />
you can drop Brent a line at NNFW26B_at_PRODIGY.COM.

<br />

<br />
PROLOGUE
<br />
DESTINATION: EARTH
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;AAAARGH!!!!!&quot; Robotnik screamed as he banged his fist on the desk,
<br />
breaking it in half.  &quot;Snively, send for maintenance to bring me a new
<br />
desk,&quot; he ordered in agitation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik had just been foiled again by his two least-favorite
<br />
hedgehogs in existence: Sonic the Hedgehog and that purple, secretive one.
<br />
His plan to turn the Freedom Fighters against each-other would have
<br />
succeeded, too, if that purple hedgehog hadn't found the antidote and
<br />
administered it to Sonic and his comrades, with the help of a fox who
<br />
looked a bit like the one that always tagged along behind Sonic.  (Robotnik
<br />
had observed that this fox was known as MTP, and the initials seemed
<br />
vaguely familiar, and that he always carried a jetpack.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's thoughts of anger were interrupted by a beeping
<br />
somewhere in the rubble of his desk.  He rummaged around through the
<br />
wreckage, and uncovered a communicator.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This had better be good, Packbell,&quot; he growled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, it is,&quot; the android replied, his image popping up on the
<br />
viewscreen.  &quot;So good, in fact, that I'll overlook the fact that you just
<br />
threatened me.  The mission to the Little Planet was a major success.
<br />
Since our last skirmish there, the Little Planet Freedom Fighters have been
<br />
scattered, and the only resistance I met were those two hedgehog sisters
<br />
with almost the same name.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Amanda and Amy Rose,&quot; Robotnik replied without question.  &quot;They
<br />
have been roboticized, I assume?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Amanda has.  She sacrificed herself battling me while her sister
<br />
ran.  How shweeeeet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And the Time Stones?&quot; Robotnik asked eagerly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All captured,&quot; the android replied with an evil grin as he held
<br />
the gleaming stones up to the monitor for Robotnik to see.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; the villain replied with a gleam in his eye.  &quot;I think
<br />
this will turn out to be a good day after all...see you soon, Packbell.&quot;
<br />
With that, he switched off his communicator and started formulating a plan
<br />
involving sending his nemeses through the space-time continuum...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's go, gang,&quot; Sonic said to his friends.  &quot;Sally's been missin'
<br />
for too long.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally-Girl can take care o' herself,&quot; Bunnie said with conviction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;but she'd've tried to get in touch if she
<br />
were safe.  I'm gonna go check things out.  If I don't give you some sort
<br />
of a message in the next half-hour, head straight for Robotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others nodded their heads in nervous agreement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the treetops above, another hedgehog watched the spectacle.  He
<br />
couldn't let this happen, he told himself.  He realized that, after Sally
<br />
had served her purpose as bait, she would end up just like his sources told
<br />
him Amanda had the day before.  He couldn't let that happen.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Prepare to meet your maker, Sonic,&quot; Robotnik said, with an evil
<br />
grin.  &quot;Literally.&quot;  He held up a Time Stone and aimed it at the hedgehog,
<br />
who disappeared before the eyes of all present: Robotnik, Snively,
<br />
Packbell, and their captive, Sally Acorn, standing in a roboticizer with a
<br />
clear-glass cover.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What did you do with him?&quot; the princess demanded, after choking
<br />
back a scream.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's merely taken a little trip to the past,&quot; Robotnik explained.
<br />
&quot;By the way, Princess, did I ever tell you how pretty you look when you're angry?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Only a half-dozen times in the past five minutes,&quot; Sally snapped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell cracked his knuckles.  &quot;She's still got spirit, I'll give
<br />
her that,&quot; he said.  &quot;Personally, though, I think she'd be much prettier as
<br />
a robot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hard to make the comparison unless we actually SEE her as a
<br />
robot,&quot; Snively said.  He reached for the switch that would bond flesh and metal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, bucko!&quot;  Sparks flew everywhere as the roboticizer
<br />
exploded.  &quot;Whoops,&quot; said Knuckles the Echidna as the smoke cleared, &quot;guess
<br />
I'm not very good with machines!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik gasped.  He had planned only to deal with the hedgehogs
<br />
and the princess; he wasn't ready for the full band of Knothole Freedom
<br />
Fighters who appeared before him!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell shrugged.  &quot;Slight change in plans,&quot; he said.  He snapped
<br />
his fingers.  The exit doors closed, and an army of SWAT-Bots appeared
<br />
through the hole Knuckles had made in the wall.  In spite of the fact that
<br />
the whole team was there, they knew they couldn't take care of all the
<br />
robots.  The situation looked hopeless, until --
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik!&quot; came a voice.  All heads turned to see Hedgehog X,
<br />
wondering how he'd gotten in.  &quot;Let them go!  I'm the one you're after!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sighed, realizing that the hedgehog could probably nuke
<br />
the whole area.  &quot;Fine,&quot; he said.  &quot;Snively, let them go.  Packbell, get him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the SWAT-Bots piled out of the building except for one.  The
<br />
Freedom Fighters walked out the hole in the wall, but then peered back in
<br />
to see the fate of their friend.  Packbell put the muzzle of his gun up to
<br />
where Hedgehog X's head was...and it went right through it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flash of light, and the hologram disappeared.  The
<br />
SWAT-Bot in the corner of the room removed its head, to reveal the REAL HX.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Bring Sonic back to the present,&quot; he ordered, leveling his gun at
<br />
Packbell's head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fool,&quot; Packbell said, &quot;you forget who manufactures those things!&quot;
<br />
Suddenly, the SWAT-Bot remains HX was inside transformed, trapping him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As for your friends,&quot; Snively said, &quot;our bargain is now void since
<br />
you tricked me.&quot;  The Freedom Fighters walked back in, held at gunpoint by
<br />
the SWAT-Bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic died millions of years ago,&quot; Robotnik said, &quot;but where
<br />
you're going, you'll wish you were dead!  Bon voyage!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A hole opened in the roof, and the metal encasing HX sprouted wings
<br />
and jets, and flew out of Robotropolis...and off of Mobius.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, Robotnik's mistake, as always, was to leave all his
<br />
enemies alive instead of killing them when he had the chance.  Sonic
<br />
returned to the present by finding the Time Stones in the past, and he
<br />
rescued the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Hedgehog X, he spent his flight wondering where he was
<br />
going, plotting revenge, and being thankful that Chaos children don't have
<br />
to worry about nourishment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, after he didn't know how long, his rocket slammed into
<br />
terra firma.  Making his way out of the rubble, he was suddenly grabbed by
<br />
humans -- Snively and Robotnik's species, he thought darkly.  They fired
<br />
some darts at him, and he lost consciousness.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER I
<br />
THE SECRET OF MTP
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No...no...stop haunting me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP shot up.  He checked his forehead.  Feverish sweat was pouring
<br />
out.  He caught his breath and wondered in terror what this could mean.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP slowly walked into the kitchen.  Knuckles was also drowsy.  &quot;We
<br />
gotta stop eating those chili dogs before bed,&quot; he groaned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Trust me...it's a lot more than that,&quot; MTP replied.  &quot;I'm going
<br />
out!&quot; he announced.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP stood in the middle of the wastelands once called Green Hill.
<br />
He was digging.  Digging for his past.  He heard shouts from far away.
<br />
Sonic was coming.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why did you follow me?&quot; MTP inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because you were acting strangely this morning.&quot;  Sonic's voice
<br />
took a different tone.  &quot;Tell us the truth!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can't handle the truth!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THIS IS NOT A GAME, MTP!&quot; Sonic shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do I poke my nose into your personal life?!&quot;  MTP slammed the
<br />
shovel down.  Then the floor collapsed, with him on it.  Sonic could only
<br />
here a faint, &quot;I'm back.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLINK!  HX slammed on the bars.  &quot;What do you want with me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The guard replied, &quot;We want to know more about you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HX groaned.  &quot;And I suppose you want to turn me into a robot
<br />
afterwards?&quot;  The human gave him a strange look.  HX shuddered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry I won't be able to join the fun!&quot;  He spun and broke through
<br />
the bars.  The human got up and tried to shoot him with more tranquilizer.
<br />
HX ducked and ran.  &quot;You stay long enough on a planet, you figure things out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waves of humans attacked as HX ran through the hospital.  Hex's
<br />
natural hedgehog agility allowed him to bounce, run, weave, and spin his
<br />
way past the flying darts.  Humans got hurt everywhere, but HX was in too
<br />
much danger to care.  When he was finally safe, something caught his
<br />
eye...a robot about to be hit by a laser.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ugh!  Those animals!&quot; Hedgehog X said, and decided to save the
<br />
'Bot, realizing it must have once been a free creature.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HX ran in, dove, and knocked the robot out of the way.  He heard a
<br />
buzz.  Next, a sharp pang in his forehead, a bright light, and then darkness.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER II
<br />
MTP SPILLS THE BEANS
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;An explanation is in order,&quot; Sonic said as MTP recovered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP was surrounded by the Freedom Fighters.  There was no backing
<br />
out.  He had to tell the tale so shocking that he feared for his friends,
<br />
especially Kate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP gulped as he decided to tell the truth...but not the WHOLE
<br />
truth.  Even so, Kate might figure out who he was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wasn't born on Mobius,&quot; he began.  Everyone gasped.  &quot;I was born
<br />
on a planet called Earth in AD 2000, and was raised in a dojo.  My father
<br />
was a master of karate, a fighting style on Earth.  He taught me the art as
<br />
I grew up there.  However, that wasn't all I learned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Japan led the world in technology at the time.  Naturally, they
<br />
needed to test new products.  When I was in college, I was doing some
<br />
research on teleportation, so I tested a giant computer that apparently had
<br />
a glitch in it that made it work with 'porting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The computer was originally designed with state-of-the-art VR
<br />
technology to actually literally suck the users into it, but somehow there
<br />
was also a glitch that made it able to send the users to other locations.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I fiddled around with it, and accidentally beamed myself to a
<br />
broken satellite, which went haywire and beamed me to a similar machine on Mobius.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that got to do with the digging?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response, MTP thrust the shovel into the wall of the pit they
<br />
were in.  The wall crumbled, revealing a giant computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going home!&quot; MTP replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can't do that!&quot; Sonic shouted.  &quot;For starters, you're a fox,
<br />
and I'm sure there aren't too many foxes on that foreign planet!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And, Robotnik said to HX that he'd be miserable there!&quot; Sally added.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's home, and I'm going!&quot;  MTP stepped into the computer and disappeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles stepped forward.  &quot;Where do you think YOU'RE going?&quot; Sonic
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To rescue that fool,&quot; Knuckles said, &quot;and to pay a debt to a
<br />
hedgehog that saved ALL our butts multiple times!&quot;  Knuckles followed MTP
<br />
into the machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked back.  &quot;We're going to take a trip!&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER III
<br />
THE RAY
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been weeks since the renegade robot Sigma's
<br />
destruction...and the disturbing return of his spirit (maybe these 'bots
<br />
were built TOO well...).  Since then, Mega Man X, the first sentient robot,
<br />
and Dr. Cain, the scientist who had found him, had been working on more
<br />
pressing matters, as the evil robots (known as Mavericks) were being kept
<br />
well under control by the new members of the Maverick Hunters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've got it,&quot; Dr. Cain said.  &quot;A way to revive Zero!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How?!&quot; X demanded, hearing the name of his best friend, who had
<br />
fallen in a battle with Sigma's right-hand robot, Vile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your X-Buster,&quot; Cain replied, indicating X's hand, which could
<br />
turn into a weapon at any time, &quot;it used to be Zero's.  Using it, you can
<br />
zap Zero's memories into this new Reploid here,&quot; and with this remark, he
<br />
pointed to a Reploid (sentient robot replicating X's design) in the corner,
<br />
&quot;who I call Kumba because he has the speed and power of the roller coaster
<br />
at Busch Gardens, where I used to go when I was young (and I still do occasionally).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;However,&quot; he said, getting back on track, &quot;it's a
<br />
once-in-a-lifetime shot.  Once it's started, it can't be canceled, and if
<br />
you miss --&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I WON'T miss,&quot; X said reassuringly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain plugged Mega Man X into a machine.  The robot aimed carefully
<br />
at Kumba, then pressed the &quot;fire&quot; button.  The X-Buster took a minute to
<br />
take in all of Zero's memories.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a short purple creature with quills on its head and back
<br />
ran into the room.  It took one look at Kumba, then dashed into him,
<br />
knocking him out of the way of the beam, which fired at it instead of
<br />
Kumba.  The creature screamed in pain, then lost consciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's going on?!&quot; Cain yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, security guards ran into the room.  &quot;Dr. Cain!&quot; one
<br />
yelled.  &quot;Thank God the alien was unable to harm you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean this creature is an extra-terrestrial?&quot; Cain demanded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; said a guard, &quot;we captured it when it appeared in a rocket.
<br />
The queerest thing...it rolled into a ball and sawed right through the bars...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;BARS?!&quot; Cain shouted.  &quot;YOU PUT IT BEHIND BARS?!&quot;  His facial
<br />
features, including his white mustache and beard, seemed to quiver, and the
<br />
veins on his bald head stood out.  &quot;Why did you consider it a threat?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; a guard said, &quot;ummmm...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nevermind,&quot; Cain said.  &quot;The important thing is that we've got to
<br />
get it to the infirmary.  There's only one way to get there on time...&quot; he
<br />
activated Kumba.  &quot;...X and Kumba have to beam us there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean convert your molecules to light without well-primed
<br />
teleportation equipment, like the robots do?&quot; the guard asked in horror.
<br />
&quot;That's too risky, sir!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain gave the guard a hard look.  &quot;Not as risky as what you've just
<br />
put this creature through.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER IV
<br />
MIND MERGE
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kumba grabbed the alien and X grabbed Dr. Cain.  The robots beamed
<br />
to the infirmary, converting Cain and the alien to light as well as
<br />
themselves.  When they reached their destination they became matter again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain ignored the headache the travel had given him and connected
<br />
the alien to a computer.  He sighed in relief.  &quot;Its life-signs are still
<br />
functioning,&quot; he said, looking at the monitor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Cain punched some keys, and its thoughts were played out
<br />
through speakers.  Two messages came out at once, in the same voice:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll survive...I have to.  I made a vow to destroy Robotnik...and
<br />
there is no way I'm backing down on it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is incredible...not only am I not dead, I'm ALIVE!  I
<br />
breathe!  It's wonderful!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My God,&quot; Dr. Cain said.  &quot;Two minds in one!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How in the name of Thomas Light do you know?!&quot; X gasped, referring
<br />
to his late creator.  &quot;We don't know anything about this creature...it
<br />
might just naturally think two sets of different thoughts at a time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but the thoughts are conflicting,&quot; Cain replied.  &quot;One seems
<br />
to think it's dying; the other realizes it's living!  It must be the
<br />
ray...it blasted Zero's thoughts into a living being!  The pain the
<br />
creature experienced must have been due to the trauma of having the two
<br />
sets of thoughts in unison.  It is imperative that I tune one set of
<br />
thoughts out until there's a way the creature can cope with it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain rapidly pressed keys.  Seconds after he entered his final
<br />
command, the creature came to.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;X!&quot; it exclaimed.  &quot;Dr. Cain!  How did you do it?  How did you
<br />
revive me into a living being?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was an accident,&quot; Cain admitted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They were using the X-Buster to beam your memories into me,&quot; Kumba
<br />
said, speaking for the first time, &quot;but some alien shoved me out of the way
<br />
and took the brunt of the blast.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I tuned out the alien's memories for the time being,&quot; Cain
<br />
continued, &quot;so that you would be able to survive.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey,&quot; X cracked, now in high spirits, &quot;since you look like a giant
<br />
purple hedgehog and you've got the mind of Zero, why don't we call you
<br />
Hedgehog Zero?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature laughed.  &quot;You've got a great sense of humor, X,&quot; it
<br />
said.  &quot;So be it...from this day forward, I shall be called Hedgehog Zero!&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER V
<br />
THE TERRAN PLANET
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights started to flicker.  A silhouette of a weird creature
<br />
appeared on the computer.  More followed.  The secretaries at  the lab
<br />
jumped back as the creatures materialized.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa!&quot; Sonic said.  &quot;Some ride!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Guards came in through the door, holding guns.  MTP gulped.
<br />
&quot;Um...we come in peace?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing all the Freedom Fighters knew, they were all in a jail
<br />
cell, except for MTP, who was being interrogated.  After the experience
<br />
with Hedgehog X, the guards had chained Sonic and Knuckles' spiny forms.
<br />
All despaired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie looked at Rotor, who was clearly thinking hard.  &quot;What's
<br />
wrong, Sugah'Rus?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you think, Bunnie?&quot; Rotor asked sarcastically, then
<br />
brightened up.  &quot;Hey, you can extend your robotic arm, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then try to get the keycard!&quot; Rotor ordered.  Bunnie successfully
<br />
pickpocketed the sleeping guard, and let the Freedom Fighters out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about us?&quot; Sonic asked, pointing to the chains that held him
<br />
and Knuckles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe MTP can help,&quot; Tails said.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER VI
<br />
RETURN TO SIGMA'S FORTRESS
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, guys,&quot; Mega Man X said, &quot;this is big.  After the past few
<br />
weeks, you've finally got the training you need.  You've earned the titles
<br />
of members of the Maverick Hunters' Elite.  Now, it's time for our big
<br />
mission...entering Sigma's sunken fortress looking for clues as to his
<br />
spirit's whereabouts.  HZ, get yourself cyborg.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog Zero entered a capsule at one end of the room.  He stood
<br />
there, his eyes closed, as a blinding white light filled the room.  When he
<br />
stepped out, he was half-robot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The capsule he had been in was designed by Thomas Light long ago,
<br />
to turn the boy Rock into Mega Man.  Unlike Robotnik's machinery, its
<br />
effects were not permanent.  Since they were going underwater, the suit was
<br />
equipped with a teleporter that would send oxygen from the surface into
<br />
HZ's helmet, since he was still partially flesh-and-blood, unlike the others.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once fully equipped, X, Kumba, and Hedgehog Zero beamed out to the
<br />
location where the fortress had sunken.  &quot;This place gives me the creeps,&quot;
<br />
HZ said through his radio to his companions, fingering his arm cannon.  &quot;I
<br />
mean, wouldn't it freak you out if you returned to the scene of your death?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It freaks me out,&quot; X said, &quot;and I didn't die here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It freaks ME out,&quot; Kumba said, &quot;and I've never even BEEN here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three cut past where X and Zero had hopped flying platforms,
<br />
Kumba running straight up the side of the cliff and firing a grapple at his
<br />
teammates.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trio proceeded until they reached the destroyed entrance to
<br />
Vile's former chamber.  One they entered, Hedgehog Zero began to shiver.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, HZ,&quot; X said, &quot;you don't need to stare at the dead husk you
<br />
once were like that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why can't you just destroy it?&quot; HZ asked coldly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it would be wise to send it back to Dr. Cain,&quot; X replied.
<br />
Kumba fired a teleportation beam at the body, and it disappeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, X tensed.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot; Kumba and HZ asked in unison.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vile,&quot; X replied.  &quot;His body's GONE.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The communicators in the Hunters' ears echoed with laughter, and
<br />
suddenly there were numerous beams of light.  &quot;Looking for me?&quot; a familiar
<br />
voice laughed.  The three whirled around to see Vile with a host of Mavericks.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER VII
<br />
THE GREAT ESCAPE
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Does anybody know where the interrogation room IS?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Um, let's ask that doctor over there!&quot;  Tails pointed to a short,
<br />
worried man in a lab coat, whose hair -- facial and what little there was
<br />
left of it on his head -- was streaked with gray and white.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctor turned around.  &quot;More ET's?&quot; he said.  &quot;You must leave
<br />
before they discover you're gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right,&quot; Tails said.  &quot;Do you know where the interrogation room is,
<br />
though?  We need to find our friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Second door to your left,&quot; the man replied.  &quot;Be careful.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FF ran to the door.  &quot;Locked,&quot; groaned Rotor.  &quot;Can't pick it, either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the door blew up.  Kate rushed in and broke the chains on
<br />
MTP, who explained his jetpack had reacted to some electromagnetic
<br />
interference and caused an explosion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, MTP, and Bunnie held the guards off, while Tails and Kate
<br />
(whose powers weren't working due to her distance from the Chaos Emeralds)
<br />
recovered the equipment the guards had confiscated from them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Freedom Fighters ran back to get Sonic and Knuckles, MTP
<br />
said, &quot;Earth is nothing like it was before.  Lots of time must have passed.
<br />
&nbsp;This is not my home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you get off chains on Earth?&quot; came Knuckles' voice from the
<br />
room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like this,&quot; MTP said, who ran to the cell where Sonic and Knuckles
<br />
were being threatened by humans, knocked the guards down, stole their
<br />
lasers, and blasted through the chains.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've got to get out of here!&quot; MTP said.  &quot;This is clearly a
<br />
government lab!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MTP and Knuckles beat up all the malicious humans they encountered
<br />
on their search for safety, trying hard not to kill them, which MTP knew
<br />
would destroy ALL their chances of survival.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do we get home?&quot; the teenage fox wondered.  &quot;Last time I
<br />
checked, no-one knew about Mobius's existence!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHAT?!&quot; Sonic gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're stranded,&quot; MTP sighed.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER VIII
<br />
MAVERICKS' ELITE VS. MAVERICK HUNTERS' ELITE
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What in Thomas Light's name is wrong with you?!&quot; X said into his
<br />
communicator, aiming the message at Vile.  &quot;Why can't you Mavericks just
<br />
stay dead?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vile, you son of a Maverick cur,&quot; Hedgehog X growled menacingly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm Vile no longer,&quot; the Maverick replied.  &quot;The name's King Lawnmower!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kumba scoffed.  &quot;O' All-Powerful Jewel-Studded Grass-Cutter,&quot; he
<br />
said, his voice oozing with sarcasm, &quot;who are your pals?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Name's NaT,&quot; a large bug-like robot said, &quot;and this is my team,
<br />
X...the Mavericks' Elite.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Would be nice if you changed your name,&quot; X replied, &quot;so we're not
<br />
mistaken for each-other.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think your a moron!&quot; a Maverick said to X.  Its vocabulary
<br />
hardware was clearly flawed, as the message that met X's ears was decoded
<br />
as a misspelling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about my 'a moron'?&quot; X replied.  &quot;I don't own any 'a moron'!
<br />
However, I think YOU'RE a moron!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Howz about you just leave the planet?&quot; NaT asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Poor little baby,&quot; another Maverick said, &quot;people confuse Mavs
<br />
with him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry, guys,&quot; said King Lawnmower, &quot;this guy's no problem.
<br />
He was a bother to Sigma, too.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah,&quot; X said, &quot;THAT would explain why old Siggy is DEAD.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sigma was a fool,&quot; King Lawnmower replied, &quot;but our new master
<br />
ain't.  I'm on the winning team now...the team of ROBOTNIK!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog Zero froze, tensing at the sound of the familiar word.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You dirty Maverick,&quot; X said in anger, not knowing what was wrong
<br />
with HZ but knowing that King Lawnmower had caused it.  &quot;Die...AGAIN!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;X spoke a command word that activated equipment he had found in a very
<br />
special hidden capsule left by his creator, Dr. Light, that called forth a
<br />
powerful fireball able to stop even the most powerful foe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was remarkable.  The fireball shot from X's fingertips, as it
<br />
had in a few previous battles, but this time, it actually pushed the water
<br />
around it away so that it would not be extinguished!  There was nothing
<br />
King Lawnmower could do to stop it...he was hit and exploded in a brilliant
<br />
flash of fire underwater.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The rest of you want to share his fate?&quot; X challenged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there was a beam of light, and another King Lawnmower
<br />
stood where the last one had fallen!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Multiple bodies,&quot; X muttered, &quot;same twisted mind.  I believe the
<br />
term is 'rIDes'.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NaT nodded.  &quot;I'd love to stay and jaw,&quot; he growled, &quot;but I've got
<br />
orders to grab your friend here.&quot;  Hedgehog Zero made no resistance as NaT
<br />
reached out and grabbed him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kumba fired a beam toward NaT, who held Hedgehog Zero in front of
<br />
him as a shield.  The beam hit HZ, and he disappeared.  &quot;Not bad, eh, X?&quot;
<br />
Kumba asked.  &quot;I anticipated he'd use HZ to block my fire...so I used a
<br />
teleportation beam!  He's safe in Cain's lab.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well done,&quot; X said.  &quot;You've learned well, cousin.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll get you for this,&quot; NaT promised.  With that, Team X beamed out.
<br />

<br />

CHAPTER IX
<br />
THE DREAM
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where am I?&quot; HX wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a robot in gleaming red armor appeared in front of him.
<br />
&quot;You're...you're me,&quot; it mumbled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; HX replied, &quot;I'M me.  Who are YOU?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I must be meeting the alien that used to inhabit my new body!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not following this too well,&quot; Hedgehog X said, his head pounding.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The robot then disappeared, and images started to flash all around
<br />
HX.  The hedgehog didn't recognize any.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next thing HX saw, he was lying in bed in a strange room.  He got
<br />
up...funny thing was, he didn't WANT to get up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's going on?&quot; Hedgehog X tried to ask.  He couldn't control
<br />
his mouth.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog went through a routine he wasn't controlling.  Then
<br />
whatever he was stepped into a capsule, and when &quot;he&quot; came out, HX was a robot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IT'S A ROBOTICIZER! HX thought.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then HX's body involuntarily sat down in a war room with two other
<br />
robots.  HX's mouth moved, and his voice said, &quot;I had a really weird dream
<br />
last night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get used to it,&quot; one of the other robots said.  It (he?) was blue
<br />
with some white armor, and curled its/his mouth (or whatever) a lot.  The
<br />
other robot was a lot like the first, only without the armor, and looked
<br />
very stern.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is this?&quot; HX wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SHUT UP!&quot; HX's mouth said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, HZ,&quot; the blue-white robot said, apparently taken aback.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not you, X,&quot; HZ (whoever was controlling HX's body) said.
<br />
&quot;It's these thoughts.  Maybe it's the hedgehog from my dream.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Zero...er, Hedgehog Zero,&quot; the totally blue robot said, &quot;can
<br />
you tell us what it's saying?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; HZ assented.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, hedgehog,&quot; the blue one started to say.  &quot;My name is Kumba.
<br />
&nbsp;This is X, and the other guy in your body is Hedgehog Zero.  What is your name?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hedgehog X,&quot; HX replied.  HZ repeated it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where are you from?&quot; X asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A planet known as Mobius.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mobius,&quot; HZ mumbled.  &quot;You mean, it's real?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; HX replied.  &quot;Not much anymore, though.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then Dr. Robotnik's discovery was REAL!&quot; X exclaimed, mystified.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU KNOW DR. ROBOTNIK?!&quot; HX screamed (or tried to).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HZ looked worried.  &quot;He doesn't sound happy about Robotnik's name.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?  I thought he was only a scientist,&quot; Kumba said.  &quot;That is,
<br />
until those Mavs mentioned him...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is Dr. Cain trying to turn a planet into a badlands?!&quot; HX said.
<br />
It was unclear whether he was sarcastic or just angry, but there was cynic
<br />
in the voice in Zero's head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe HX can help us with this Team X!&quot; Kumba gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They need help THEMSELVES,&quot; X muttered.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER X
<br />
THE UNHAPPY REUNION
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU FAILED!!!&quot; screamed a sinister -- and angry -- voice.  &quot;After
<br />
all the training I put you through, you failed MISERABLY!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord Robotnik...&quot; NaT started to reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Silence, FOOL!&quot; Robotnik screamed.  &quot;Come here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Team X leader obeyed, fear enveloping him.  Robotnik pointed a
<br />
finger at him and said an inaudible word, and sparks flew everywhere as NaT
<br />
exploded.  &quot;Thus shall all perish who fail me,&quot; he said in a dangerous whisper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik pointed at another Maverick, who looked like X's adversary
<br />
Storm Eagle, only jet black.  The Maverick cringed in fear, waiting to
<br />
explode like his leader.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fool,&quot; Robotnik said, &quot;I am not destroying you...YET.&quot;  &quot;You,
<br />
Crow, are the new leader of Team X.  Fail, and all of you shall end up like
<br />
that fool!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Team X, the Maverick Elite, beamed out.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'd think they'd check for bugs,&quot; HX said (once his
<br />
consciousness had been discovered &quot;awake&quot; in HZ's mind, Dr. Cain had
<br />
adjusted his brain so that Zero and Hedgehog X could alternate thoughts at
<br />
will).  &quot;Robotnik may be a lot of things, most of which I shouldn't repeat,
<br />
but he's usually not an idiot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just be thankful he DIDN'T,&quot; Kumba replied.  &quot;At least we know NaT
<br />
is toast.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there came the buzzing of static from the communicator.
<br />
X swore.  &quot;He's found it!&quot; he exclaimed.  &quot;Now we won't know their plans!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're way off track,&quot; Sonic muttered.  &quot;We've got to be on the
<br />
other side of the world from Hedgehog X!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Besides,&quot; Tails said, &quot;this planet is populated by the same
<br />
species as Robotnik!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe so,&quot; Knuckles replied, &quot;but we'll find him, whatever it
<br />
takes!&quot;  With those determined words, he punched a wall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall he hit was protected by one of the most dense force fields
<br />
known to mankind, powerful enough to keep a robot from beaming through
<br />
it...but not powerful enough to stop a hotheaded echidna.  Knuckles hit it
<br />
again and again, not having the slightest idea why, just wanting to break something.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wall broke to smithereens, and the Freedom Fighters met with
<br />
the startled glances of three robots, one of whom looked startlingly familiar.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog and the robot who appeared to be the leader ran
<br />
toward each-other, both ready to attack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More Mavericks!&quot; X shouted.  &quot;How'd you get in here?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time, Sonic shouted, &quot;You roboticized HX!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both paused, trying to comprehend what the other was saying.  HX
<br />
broke the silence, screaming, &quot;You're BOTH wrong!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog explained the Maverick Hunters' Elite to the Freedom
<br />
Fighters, and vice-versa.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, an alarm went off.  &quot;Dr. Cain's in trouble!&quot; X exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stay here,&quot; Kumba said.  The Maverick Hunters' Elite beamed out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hunters appeared in Cain's lab.  Somehow, Team X had gotten in.
<br />
&nbsp;Crow held his arm cannon at Cain, who had already been beaten into unconsciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do what I say,&quot; Crow growled, &quot;or I'll blast him to Kingdom Come!
<br />
You have no choice!&quot;  He was right, and they all knew it.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER XI
<br />
CAPTURED!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did he say 'Dr. Cain?&quot; Tails asked.  When Kate nodded, he said,
<br />
&quot;That was what the nametag said on that scientist's coat!  You know, the
<br />
one who helped us!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's go!&quot; Knuckles said.  The group ran out through the hole in
<br />
the wall, and down the hall to where they had seen Cain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, man!&quot; said the Maverick known as Rose as the Freedom Fighters
<br />
entered.  &quot;The Freedom Fighters are reunited!  Robotnik will fry us for sure!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Careful when you use that accursed name,&quot; Hedgehog Zero said with
<br />
an ironic grin.  &quot;KL using it is what brought me back!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quizzical look appeared on King Lawnmower's face, although no-one
<br />
could see it through his helmet.  &quot;I don't know what you're talking about,&quot;
<br />
he said, &quot;but you can all TAKE THIS!&quot;  With those words, he fired a ray at
<br />
the Freedom Fighters that caused them to be rendered senseless until a
<br />
human consciousness was sensed in the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See ya,&quot; Crow said to the Freedom Fighters.  &quot;X, Kumba,
<br />
c'mere...we're goin' for a little ride.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crow dropped Dr. Cain, and Team X beamed out with X and Kumba in
<br />
tow.  A few minutes later, humans entered, breaking the effects of King
<br />
Lawnmower's ray.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dr. Cain!&quot; a guard screamed.  &quot;Quick, someone get him to the infirmary!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As for you aliens,&quot; another guard said as Cain was being taken
<br />
away, &quot;you're under arrest for the attempted murder of Dr. Cain!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog Zero started to say something, but realized it was
<br />
useless.  He knew these guards were too thick-headed to believe him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters were locked away in separate Maverick-proof
<br />
cells...but, as was shown before, Maverick-proof things aren't necessarily echidna-proof...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
CHAPTER XII
<br />
FIGHT TO THE FINISH
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No human can hold me!&quot; Knuckles screamed.  He pounded on the wall,
<br />
crumbling it.  &quot;These humans quite obviously don't know how to imprison us!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then how come we were trapped before?&quot; Tails asked the echidna, annoyed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The cages you were put in were probably designed for humans,&quot;
<br />
Hedgehog Zero explained as Knuckles freed the rest of them.  &quot;Humans are
<br />
animals.  These, though, are for 'bots.  The morons think we're Mavericks.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team, now loose, raced outside, dodging humans and flying
<br />
plasma.  &quot;Stop, Mavericks!&quot; a Maverick Hunter yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We ain't Mavericks,&quot; Sonic yelled, spin-dodging the weapons aimed
<br />
at him, &quot;and we ain't stoppin'!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Freedom Fighters escaped through the doors, a Hunter tried
<br />
to send a message to X.  &quot;Mega Man X!&quot; he shouted.  &quot;Come in!  X, answer
<br />
me!  A group of dangerous Mavericks have just escaped!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mega Man X couldn't obtain any transmissions.  He and Kumba were in
<br />
cells, similar to the ones the Freedom Fighters had recently escaped, in
<br />
Team X's Earth base.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's stirring,&quot; a scientist said, monitoring Dr. Cain's condition
<br />
on a computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cain groaned.  He tried to get words out, but couldn't.  He had
<br />
heard sounds around him, but couldn't reply to any of them.  He wanted to
<br />
scream out that Hedgehog Zero and the other extra-terrestrials were
<br />
innocent, for he'd learned of what had happened, but he hadn't the strength.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll connect him to this,&quot; the scientist decided, getting ready to
<br />
plug Cain into the type of thought-monitoring device that had been used on
<br />
Hedgehog X earlier.  Suddenly, a Maverick appeared and hit his hand away!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gotcha!&quot; said Crow gleefully.  He trapped all the humans in the
<br />
infirmary building in capsules, which was what the rest of Team X was doing
<br />
to all who opposed them all over the city.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the opposition was gathered, the capsules were put near the
<br />
town square, including the ones containing X and Kumba.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Lawnmower gloated.  &quot;Robotnik is truly a greater and more
<br />
powerful master than Sigma ever was!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there was an explosion behind him.  Hedgehog Zero had
<br />
broken out of his capsule, and was flying towards him, screaming, &quot;Maybe,
<br />
but I'm not through yet!!!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Lawnmower had quite a sense of dj vu at this scene.  &quot;Now,&quot; he
<br />
said as the cyborg landed in front of him, &quot;where has this happened before?
<br />
&nbsp;Oh yes, I remember now...right vefore I killed you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wrongo!&quot; came the reply.  &quot;YOU AIN'T TALKIN' TO ZERO!!!&quot;  Before
<br />
King Lawnmower knew what was going on, Hedgehog X had blasted Mega Man X's
<br />
capsule to bits, whispered the word to shed his cybernetics, jumped
<br />
skyward, rolled into a ball, and sawed his adversary's arm off, destroying
<br />
the rocket-launcher on King Lawnmower's shoulder in the process.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Big deal,&quot; the Maverick said.  &quot;I've already made it clear that I
<br />
can use as many bodies as I want with rIDes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're bluffing,&quot; X said smugly.  &quot;I heard you at your
<br />
base...Robotnik isn't too keen on helping you out this time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Lawnmower gasped as Mega Man X freed the Freedom Fighters and
<br />
Kumba, while Hedgehog X held off the Mavericks who tried to stop him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A battle ensued.  However, since the Mavericks basically just
<br />
hyperactively bombarded their enemies with insults and weaponry, not really
<br />
planning anything (King Lawnmower, with his launcher destroyed, could only
<br />
insult them and attempt close-range attacks), so they didn't stand much of
<br />
a chance against our sure-footed, quick-thinking heroes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles bashed Mavericks' heads together; Kate and MTP used their
<br />
karate expertise (trying not to hurt their feet when they hit the metal); a
<br />
pair of insane bystanders blasted several tremendous holes in the Maverick
<br />
known as The Great Kazoo, covered one with wax paper, then blew into him,
<br />
afterwards saying, &quot;Huh-huh-huh...kazoos suck!&quot;; the hedgehogs sawed
<br />
through Mavericks; Tails picked up foes and dropped them; Rotor scrambled
<br />
Team X's sorry excuses for brains; and X and Kumba blasted whoever was left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the Mavericks were about as close to the scrap heap as
<br />
they could possibly get without being there, Crow yelled, &quot;We must flee!
<br />
Go far, far away...where Robotnik can't get us and neither can they!  We'll
<br />
be back, mark my words, FF and MHE!&quot;  Then, those whose beaming abilities
<br />
still worked supported those whose didn't, and the whole team left.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much later, the Freedom Fighters were ready to return to Mobius.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going with you,&quot; X decided.  &quot;Robotnik must be stopped, just
<br />
as Sigma had to be.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going too,&quot; Kumba added.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After getting Knothole's coordinates from the pocket computer known
<br />
as Nicole, X, Kumba, and HX/HZ beamed everyone there, although it was rough.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A voice laughed softly.  &quot;While the hunters are away, X, the
<br />
Mavericks will play!&quot;  It was the ghost of Sigma.
<br />

<br />
END!
<br />

<br />
Okay, once again, I must shamelessly plug the upcoming story, THE HUNT
<br />
BEGINS.  For those of you who scoff at stories that don't follow the main
<br />
Sonic thread enough, hopefully this will be satisfactory!  I've put a lot
<br />
of effort into it, and it's almost done!
