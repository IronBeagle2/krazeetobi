The usual SPOILERS alert.
<br />

<br />
Sonic #33 [April 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover art by Spaziante has Sonic up to his ankles and elbows
<br />
in...well, it sure LOOKS biological!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's Get Small&quot; (in 3 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WARNING: There's no way I can describe this story without
<br />
tipping Gallagher's hand and quoting some truly awful puns he's
<br />
worked into the script.  To compensate, I will be rating some of
<br />
the puns in the course of this review, using the following
<br />
guidelines:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-         Bad
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--        Way Past Bad
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---       I Think I Shall Hurl
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----      A Capital Offence on Mobius
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, on with the fun 'n' games.  Sonic returns to Knothole
<br />
from a patrol to find the place almost deserted.  It turns out
<br />
that everybody is laid up with a microbionic infection introduced
<br />
into their food supply by Robotnik.  Since he apparently placed
<br />
the bugs in an order of take-out fries, everyone has contacted
<br />
&quot;the French Frirus&quot; (--).  Rotor hangs in to give Sonic and the
<br />
reader the details before passing out.  Using a gizmo left over
<br />
from &quot;Lizard of Odd&quot; [Sonic #3], Sonic gives himself the title
<br />
treatment and we're off on yet another &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;
<br />
knockoff.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Rotor has the decency to pass out with his mouth open,
<br />
Sonic travels down Rotor's gullet until he meets...ROTOR IN
<br />
DRAG!!  Seriously, he comes across a mini-Rotor wearing a print
<br />
dress, gaudy earrings, and 10 pounds of cotton on its head.  This
<br />
singular entity is called Rotor's &quot;Auntie Bodies&quot; (----).  Auntie
<br />
tells Sonic she's given up fighting against the French Frirus. 
<br />
Not willing to take this lying down, Sonic continues on only to
<br />
encounter exploding pustules which also speak with Antoine's
<br />
bogus accent: The French Foreign Lesions (----).  Where's the
<br />
French Anti-Defamation League when you really need them?  After
<br />
Sonic spins past them, he encounters the beret-wearing, equally-
<br />
accented &quot;Paris-site&quot; (---) who tries to cook Sonic using Fever
<br />
(an animate flame--you've seen 'em in cartoons a hundred times
<br />
before).  Sonic learns that he can't punch out a flame, but just
<br />
as he's about to get hit by the Paris-site's &quot;microbe-bar&quot; (-),
<br />
Auntie Bodies intervenes.  Emboldened by Sonic's &quot;unselfish&quot; [and
<br />
unspecified] act, she conks Paris-site while Sonic runs rings
<br />
around Fever and extinguishes him.  So now it's time for the
<br />
story's DEUS EX MACHINA: Rotor's Auntie Bodies uses a single-
<br />
celled cellular phone (--) [she should have used a T-cellular
<br />
phone!] to contact the Auntie Bodies in the other freedom
<br />
fighters.  Medicine by telepathy...or is that telephony, with a
<br />
capital PHONEY?  Anyway, the sharp of eye can enjoy images of
<br />
Sally, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine dressed like little old ladies
<br />
beating up on Paris-sites.  Where's the American Association of
<br />
Retired Persons when you really need them?  With Rotor on the
<br />
road to recovery, Sonic leaves Rotor only to realize that he's
<br />
too small to reach the controls of the miniaturizer/enlarger.  In
<br />
order to work the switch, Sonic jams himself up Rotor's nose (all
<br />
together now: EEEEEEEEW!!), causing him to sneeze Sonic onto the
<br />
controls.  Gallagher may think this is a credible turn of the
<br />
story, but it's snot (sorry, but Gallagher didn't use that joke
<br />
in the story and it was just lying around).  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last time I was down with the flu I felt like I'd been
<br />
hit by a truck.  Still, I also knew that in a week's time the flu
<br />
would just be a bad memory.  Gallagher, however, tells us nothing
<br />
about the French Frirus.  Is it potentially fatal or just a
<br />
disabling annoyance?  There's no way that a comic book aimed at
<br />
kids would entertain notions of the former, and if the latter is
<br />
the case then all Sonic has to do is wait for everyone to
<br />
recover.  In short, there's no story.  The character of Auntie
<br />
Bodies doesn't seem to be of much help; if she/it had been
<br />
threatened by Paris-site in some heinous fashion, you'd have the
<br />
makings of a Mobian equivalent to a serious immunodeficiency
<br />
condition.  Or would that be too close to reality?  The biggest
<br />
joke in this story, unfortunately, is its display of medical
<br />
knowledge.  Where's the Centers for Disease Control when you
<br />
really need them?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is, however, one redeeming feature to the story which
<br />
deserves a place in the Sonic canon.  No, it's not the sight of
<br />
Rotor in drag.  At the very end, Sonic prepares a batch of &quot;my
<br />
Auntie's secret recipe for chicken soup.&quot;  Not only has such a
<br />
person as Sonic's aunt never been mentioned (does this mean Uncle
<br />
Chuck became a widower at some point?), but Rotor points out that
<br />
&quot;it's made with chili dogs.&quot;  So that answers one of the long-
<br />
simmering (--) debates on the list: those chili dogs Sonic's been
<br />
scarfing all this time have been made with chicken franks!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Big Picture&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, an excerpt [sort of] from &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; by Charles
<br />
Dickens:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The
<br />
editor, in his checkered shirt, stationed himself at the desk;
<br />
his pauper assistants ranged themselves behind him; the story was
<br />
served out....  The story disappeared; the boys whispered each
<br />
other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. 
<br />
Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with
<br />
misery.  He rose from the table; and advancing to the editor, the
<br />
two pages in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please, Sir, I want some more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor was a dark, bearded man; but he turned very pale. 
<br />
He gazed in stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some
<br />
seconds, and then clung for support to the desk.  The assistants
<br />
were paralyzed with wonder; the boys with fear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!&quot; said the editor at length, with a faint voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please, Sir,&quot; replied Oliver, &quot;I want some more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The editor aimed a blow at Oliver's head with a rolled-up
<br />
Archie Digest; pinioned him in his arms; and shrieked aloud for
<br />
the beadle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Fulop
<br />
rushed into the room in great excitement, and addressing he
<br />
gentleman in the high chair said,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mr. Goldwater, I beg your pardon, Sir!  Oliver Twist has
<br />
asked for more!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every
<br />
countenance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For MORE!&quot; said Mr. Goldwater.  &quot;Compose yourself, Fulop,
<br />
and answer me directly.  Do I understand that he asked for more,
<br />
after having read the allotted two pages per month?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He did, Sir,&quot; replied Fulop.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That boy will be hung...I know that boy will be hung.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, and some hooded figure in a multi-screened control room
<br />
is watching Knuckles and the Chaotix.  I wonder if anyone
<br />
remembers the plot, or even cares.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Shot&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story and Art: Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobian Freedom Fighters are engaged in a game of ice
<br />
hockey when Snively shows up with some SWATbots to take on
<br />
Sonic's team.  Snively intends it to be a friendly game, and
<br />
insists he's there without Robotnik's knowledge.  Somehow,
<br />
Robotnik discovers this and uses it to his advantage, issuing a
<br />
winner-take-all challenge.  Sonic accepts and even though the
<br />
SWATbots play a very physical game against the Mobians, Sonic
<br />
makes a save at the net and scores the winning goal--so what else
<br />
is new?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story came out of nowhere -- to say that Snively's out
<br />
of character is to have a firm grasp of the obvious.  The reader
<br />
never knows how Robotnik is able to communicate with Sonic et
<br />
al., is there some kind of monitor at the rink (which had better
<br />
NOT be located in or near Knothole!), or what?  Robotnik doesn't
<br />
even sic the SWATbots on the Mobians after the match -- he only
<br />
SAYS he's a sore loser but doesn't prove it by his actions.  The
<br />
writing is flatter than a Zambonied ice rink; these Mighty Ducks
<br />
don't yield any mighty yucks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Sonic Grams: only covers for the Super Sonic v. Hyper
<br />
Knuckles special, and Sonic #34 (which hints that Uncle Chuck
<br />
might be suffering a relapse).  Beyond that, there are 2.5 inches
<br />
of fine print stating circulation figures which still manages to
<br />
be more entertaining than the cartoons featuring Scott et al. 
<br />
Ron Bauerle, after analyzing the figures, expressed worry that
<br />
something like 2/3 of the shipped comics are returned to the
<br />
publisher by comic shops and so forth, but Paul Castiglia got on
<br />
the list to assure us that Sonic's sales and circulation numbers
<br />
are just fine, thanks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not for long, if they keep on publishing magazines like #33. 
<br />
There really wasn't much to redeem this one.  Paul C. has
<br />
suggested that those of us on the list submit story ideas to
<br />
Scott Fulop for consideration, in the form of a single short
<br />
paragraph, three ideas per page.  Yet I fear that if someone
<br />
were, for instance, to submit the plot of Michael Szal's fanfic
<br />
&quot;Nano-Wars&quot; it would, by the time Archie got through with it, end
<br />
up reading like &quot;Let's Get Small.&quot;  Still, in order to rescue the
<br />
mag from creeping lameness, maybe we'd better start coming up
<br />
with story ideas for them to work with.  Can't be too hard; look
<br />
at what got into this issue: knockoffs based (however loosely) on
<br />
two movies: &quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot; and &quot;The Mighty Ducks.&quot;  Consult
<br />
Ratman's ftp site for Paul C.'s memo on submissions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In keeping with the rather psychedelic cover art, attention
<br />
should also be paid to the 1 page ad for the Sonic-Knuckles
<br />
special toward the back.  In the ad, a blue Sonic becomes a
<br />
yellow Super Sonic, and a red Knuckles becomes a magenta Hyper
<br />
Knuckles.  Their dance-like poses remind me of those colorful
<br />
dancing bears that are a part of Grateful Dead iconography. 
<br />
Actually, their colors also remind me of the uniforms worn by the
<br />
members of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  We're sorry,
<br />
but it's time to go.
<br />
