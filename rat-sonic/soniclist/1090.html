&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreword:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In more than one issue of the STH comic the so-called &quot;Cosmic
<br />
Interstate&quot; has been mentioned.  Most noted was issue #19 (I
<br />
believe), &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;, which noted that there were
<br />
(in theory) many, many versions of the hedgehog.  But what are
<br />
these other realms like?  What are the others like in them?  Is
<br />
Bunnie always such a babe in them (Sorry, that just slipped out)?
<br />
Let us look at one...  Offramp #14-a-347-bx-2, Mobs in the age of
<br />
high fantasy...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prologue
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Know, oh Prince. that in the age of the House of Acorn, when
<br />
a darkness rose from the bitter East to cleave the Kingdom and to
<br />
bring strife and misery to the children of Karuis, there came Son-
<br />
Ak, a thief, a reaver, a runner, who had sought only adventure but
<br />
found himself n the path of heroes, who won a crown and a bride by
<br />
the strength of his good right arm and the swiftness of his feet.
<br />
Or something like that.  I really don't remember, I haven't had
<br />
enough sleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chronicles of Mandar the Insomniac
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was mostly rain that day, rain and mud, and the lost
<br />
warrior trudged through the thick gruel that water and dust had
<br />
made of the road with an expression of bitter annoyance and a heart
<br />
filled with growing mayhem.  In time, he came to a roadside tavern,
<br />
and entered with considerable depression.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barmaid took a single look at him and quailed.
<br />
Understandably, for the warrior was an intimidating sort.  Tall for
<br />
a hedgehog-- over three feet, in fact-- clad in a hide tunic and
<br />
boots, and carrying a large battleaxe on his back,  he had the
<br />
still visible marks of battle scars under his frontal fur.  His
<br />
quills were longer and sharper than the usual for his kind, and
<br />
were styled in an intimidating blade-like fashion,  and were of
<br />
the blue color peculiar to the barbarian tribes of the northlands.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior took a seat at an unoccupied table, and the
<br />
barmaid, urged on by the tavern keeper, approached uncertainly.
<br />
Her life wasn't the easiest, and she feared that the fearsome
<br />
stranger would grab at her, or yell, or something frightening.  But
<br />
he merely growled for ale and food, tossing a few copper coins
<br />
down-- enough to pay for his desires.  And sulked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, I HATE rain.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moment, the barmaid bought a plate of sausages and
<br />
cheese, some bread, and a pitcher of ale to the table.  She began
<br />
to leave, when the hedgehog began to do something odd.  First he
<br />
cut two slender pieces of bread from the loaf, then placed a
<br />
sausage on one, scraped off bits of cheese onto it, sighed, and
<br />
covered the whole with the other slice of bread.  &quot;Wish I had some
<br />
stew for this,&quot;  he mumbled quietly.  &quot;Always goes better with some
<br />
stew.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger ate in silence then, silence unbroken except for
<br />
the sipping of ale and the occasional unquiet burp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's... not very polite,&quot; whispered the barmaid to the
<br />
innkeeper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look at his dress, lass.  He's a barbarian, a northern
<br />
warrior.  You think he's used to doilies and fingerbowls?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As though you had any,&quot; sniffed the barmaid, and returned to
<br />
the other customers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog finished his meal in (relative) silence, and paid
<br />
for a room in back.  He entered, still silent, still sulking.  And
<br />
fell into a fitful sleep...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;speed... the speed of the Chosen... blue wind and golden
<br />
fire...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The noise of the barmaid's screams broke the hedgehog's
<br />
unpleasant dream.  With long-practiced reflexes he leapt to his
<br />
feet, grabbed his axe, and cast open his door.  He didn't really
<br />
expect anything-- perhaps some patron who had drank too much and
<br />
could not handle it too well had got too &quot;friendly&quot;, at worst some
<br />
bandits of some sort-- whatever, it would hardly be any--
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second, the warrior thought they were soldiers of some
<br />
sort, in strange armor.  But the movements were wrong, there were
<br />
no joints.  The barbarian realized that they were statues of some
<br />
dark metal, bought to life by some hellish spell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time in weeks, Son-ak the Blue grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost casually he began to whirl his battleaxe in a circle,
<br />
but rather than the usual two or three swings most would have used,
<br />
(to intimidate)  Son-ak continued to spin the blade, faster and
<br />
faster, until it was a silvery circle above his head.  And then,
<br />
with a blood-chilling war cry, he charged the demon-statues.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a common blade-stroke would have hardly bent the metal
<br />
of the enchanted figures, the whirling axe struck with such force
<br />
that the metal parted.  Green fire erupted from the cracked shell
<br />
of the statue, and the figure collapsed into shards of broken
<br />
metal.  The two remaining figures turned towards this unexpected
<br />
interruption.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak suddenly threw his axe at one, and leapt at the second,
<br />
tucking into a rolling ball in mid-leap.  The axe cracked one
<br />
statue, and-- amazingly-- Son-ak opened the other with flailing
<br />
quills.  Both spat the same green flame, both crumbled into scraps
<br />
of metal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The innkeeper stared at the remains of the three figures, and
<br />
at the now wildly grinning hedgehog, who threw back his head and
<br />
howled a barbaric cry of defiance and victory.  Then he turned his
<br />
attentions to the barmaid, who had collapsed after she had
<br />
screamed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hah!  I'd thought that there wasn't anything to do here!  You
<br />
ought to have told me of such entertainment, innkeeper!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Entertainment,&quot; spat the innkeeper.  &quot;You may call it
<br />
entertainment, Barbarian, but no one here would.  We've had enough
<br />
grief from the Dark Wizard before.  Still, my thanks for stopping
<br />
those golems.  I've never seen such bladework before with an axe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aye,&quot; grinned the hedgehog,&quot;And ye won't soon see it again!
<br />
I am Son-ak of the Cad-hai, the Swift one, the runner past the
<br />
wind, the Striker!  I run swifter than a thunderclap, strike harder
<br />
thana the lightning--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And boast louder than a donkey,&quot; came a dry voice from
<br />
behind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And boast louder than a donkey!  I-- Hey, wait a minute,&quot;
<br />
sputtered Son-ak.  He turned about, to face the new speaker.
<br />
&quot;That's hardly polite, bent-ear.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spare me a barbarian's etiquette,&quot; replied the newcomer.
<br />
Son-ak frowned, even as he sized up the speaker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the females he'd seen in his travels in the south had
<br />
been dressed either in simple tunics and dresses (if poor) or in
<br />
silks and gold (if wealthy, and rather skimpy if they had the looks
<br />
for it).  This one was garbed, instead, in a black leather halter
<br />
and trunks, with tall boots of the same material and plated
<br />
gauntlets.  The rabbit's ear was bent, at elast one was, but her
<br />
eyes were those of a warrior, and the large two-handed sword she
<br />
had cast on her back was not any city maiden's toy.  That she
<br />
could-- and did-- carry such a weapon meant she considered herself
<br />
a fighter.  The thin scar across her left eye (fortunate to have
<br />
missed the eye itself) meant she was.  And that no other scars were
<br />
visible meant she was a warrior of skill.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Captain Rabbot,&quot; blurted the innkeeper.  &quot;You should have
<br />
seen him, he--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw, innkeeper,&quot; she interrupted.  &quot;You-- I think you'd
<br />
better come with me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak tightened his grip on his axe.  &quot;If there's some idiot
<br />
law against aiding innkeepers here against demon-tricks--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit laughed.  &quot;By Mosthe', no, swift one.  But anyone
<br />
who can fight like that-- and with such an unusual technique-- will
<br />
interest my mistress immensely.  Besides, there's a bounty of five
<br />
royals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
<br />
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to
<br />

sroyals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
<br />
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to
<br />
collect it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your mistress.  And who is that?  For that, who are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot;Am Captain Bunnie,  in service to
<br />
her Highness, the Princess Salar-Alicia of House Acorn, and leader
<br />
of her Royal Guards.  And I already... ah... 'heard' of you,
<br />
hedgehog.  You want your fifteen royals or not?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak grinned.  After weeks of boredom, things were looking
<br />
up.  A good fight, gold to refill his almost empty purse, and he'd
<br />
met a female of both obvious bravery and courage-- and, not that he
<br />
allowed himself to notice, beauty as well.  Yes, perhaps his
<br />
fortunes were changing for the better...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the east, a massive form shuddered.  A hand clutched a
<br />
glittering stone, and a quiet snarl escaped thick lips.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sniv.  To me.  Now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows produced a short, black swathed figure.  &quot;My
<br />
lord?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Something in the west has destroyed three of my iron golems
<br />
in as many moments.  And when I am about to begin my true plans,
<br />
that is an ill matter.  Ill indeed...You are my master spy, Sniv
<br />
the Quiet.  Go forth, go and learn what causes me such concern at
<br />
this time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you command, Master.&quot;  The figure melted back into the
<br />
shadows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roboth-amon, the Dark Wizard of the East, mused on the
<br />
possibility-- for the first time-- that his designs might be in
<br />
peril.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry for the fractured chapter... I just learned that my board
<br />
allows only 150 lines per message.  (Oh, brother.)
