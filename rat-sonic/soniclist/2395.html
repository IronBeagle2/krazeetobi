<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see you guys are getting so much better, but why?  ...

<br />

<br />
Yup.. The 'maturity' of the comic has jumped around a bit... especially 
<br />
in the earlier issues (it seems to be geared for an older audience 
<br />
nowadays).  I've always attributed this to the Archie staff trying to 
<br />
figure out exactly WHO their audience is.  I've also attributed this 
<br />
to taking a while for the writers to figure out what to do with the 
<br />
characters. [ e.g. Ever notice how stiff everyone seemed in the earlier
<br />
episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation?  The writers and actors 
<br />
didn't have a good idea of who the cast was supposed to be until the 
<br />
third season ]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                                               ...  I guess what I'm 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; asking is did people get laid off because they were doing a crappy job, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and better artists/etc. haulled in?  I haven't noticed TOO many changes.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe it's just me.  
</em><br />

<br />
I've noticed quite a few changes... I was going to make a table which has
<br />
all the artists, editors, pencilers, etc. and which issues they did but 
<br />
never got around to it.  I'm pretty sure the top guy (Goldwater) has stayed
<br />
the same since Sonic Miniseries #0 but hasn't there been a few other
<br />
Editor changes?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PS-don't take the previous as a bash.  I guess I'm just a little kid with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a bigger allowence &amp; still buy all the STH stuff-yes, even princess sally 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mini-series, (and NO, I'm not gay!).
</em><br />

<br />
I've never said you're gay... I just said you have cooties cuz you bought
<br />
a girl comic... nyeh nyeh nyeh.  [ just kidding... see my previous mail 
<br />
posted here to figure out where THAT comment came from ]
