I mentioned not long ago that I got the finale to the Princess Sally 
<br />
miniseries.  I finally brought it with me so now I can type up a summary.

Quick Recap of Parts O, I and II
<br />
( I call the prelude.. found in a Sonic issue part 0 )
<br />

<br />
( Part 0 )
<br />
While on a mission to destroy an energy substation alone, Sally runs into 
<br />
'Former Secret Agent Geoffery St. John' [skunk]'.
<br />

<br />
( Part I )
<br />
St. John joins Sally and her group of 'freedom fighter trainees'.
<br />
( Hamlin [pig], Penelope [platypus], Arlo [armadillo], Dylan [porcupine?] )
<br />
The plan: Knock out two more energy substations and that 'should' cripple 
<br />
Robotnik's defensive net.  The trainees don't like St. John's attitude
<br />
(especially Hamlin) but Sally seems to have complete confidence in him.
<br />
All six work together to destroy the 2nd substation.
<br />

<br />
At the end of Part I however... we see St. John wander off while everyone
<br />
is asleep...  'teleport' to a laboratory somewhere, and look what appears 
<br />
to be a duplicate of Sally in a chamber.
<br />

<br />
( Part II )
<br />
While hang-gliding in to the third substation, Arlo's glider is shot and
<br />
he crashes in the trees.  Penelope stays with him while the others go to
<br />
the substation.  They succeed in destroying it but find can't find Arlo
<br />
or Penelope when they return (no sign of trouble and no tracks)... The go 
<br />
back to camp hoping their missing comrades will either be there or will 
<br />
somehow show up.  After a few hours there's still no sign of them.
<br />

<br />
Shortly before dawn, while the others are asleep, St. John takes Sally 
<br />
(asleep) with him, swaps her with the other Sally, and contacts Robotnik
<br />
telling of his success. 
<br />

<br />
The next morning, with the 3 substations down and the defenses supposedly
<br />
crippled, Sally (the other Sally that is), Hamlin, and Dylan begin their
<br />
raid on Robotropolis (Hamlin wonders where St. John is but Sally says he's 
<br />
scouting ahead.  Meanwhile, St. John brings Sally (in the container) to 
<br />
Robotnik.  Robotnik seems confident the others are falling for his trap.
<br />

<br />
---
<br />

<br />
( Part III )
<br />

<br />
And now for the Conclusion of 'Deadliest of the Species'
<br />

<br />
Sally, Hamlin, and Dylan are fighting their way into Robotropolis with their
<br />
paint-guns and grenades (blinding the SWATBots).  Dylan's believes that
<br />
attacking at half-strength isn't wise yet they press on.  Hamlin nearly 
<br />
falls from a collapsing catwalk but Sally rescues him.
<br />

<br />
The eventually reach their objective, break down the doors, and find...
<br />
Robotnik, St. John, and Sally (in the container).  Hamlin realizes Geffory
<br />
must be a traiter so he jumps him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and 
<br />
St. John are on the same side... The jig is up!
<br />

<br />
Robotnik announces that Sally is an Auto-Automaton (a perfect robot 
<br />
duplicate in every way) and that there was NO weakness in the defense 
<br />
system.  With the first Auto-Automaton successful his masterplan is to
<br />
replace key members of the freedom fighters (i.e. we see Auto-Automatons 
<br />
of Sonic and Tails being built)  Robotnik also plans to roboticize Sally 
<br />
(the one in the container which St. John brought).
<br />

<br />
Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber blows up!
<br />
A &quot;feedback loop&quot; occurred.  Something which is impossible unless... the
<br />
subject is ALREADY a robot.  He tried to robotizice the Auto-Automaton
<br />
and the REAL Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin!.
<br />

<br />
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but he had a backup plan.  Large 
<br />
Stealth'Bots begin coming out of the walls and capture the freedom fighters.
<br />
( Its interesting to note that you could see outlines of the Stealth'Bots 
<br />
5 pages back when the freedom fighters first entered ).  St. John clicks 
<br />
on a remote control and a vehicle burrows its way up from the floor!
<br />

<br />
Out pop Penelope, Arlo, and three 'moles' from the vehicle.  They help free
<br />
Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint-guns).  Robotnik however, manages to
<br />
activate a 30 second self-destruct sequence and slides down an escape chute.
<br />

<br />
With the seconds ticking away, Sally and the others all head to the 
<br />
Vehicle Maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air-cars ( from Hangar 18..
<br />
haw haw ) and 'Shooom!' out of there with no time to spare.
<br />

<br />
With everyone back at the base, Sally gives Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo, and Dylan
<br />
Battlefield Commissions and promotes them to full-fledged Freedom Fighters.
<br />

<br />
But.. How did all this happen???   Afterwards Sally explains:
<br />

<br />
The FIRST 'Sally Switch' occurred right at the beginning of Part I shortly
<br />
after meeting St. John.  St. John was really the leader of the 'Rebel 
<br />
Underground' and acted as a double agent in order to gain Robotnik's trust 
<br />
and activate the robot duplicate prematurely in order to find out what its
<br />
plans were.  It was the Auto-Automaton Sally which helped attack the 2nd 
<br />
and 3rd substations.  The Auto-Automaton was such a good copy that it gave
<br />
orders, made hard choices, and even grieved for missing comrades.  There 
<br />
were TWO differences though:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Robot Sally wore a Purple vest while the real one wore blue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Robot Sally referred to St. John as &quot;Geoffrey&quot; while the real
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally referred to him as &quot;Mister Saint John&quot;.
<br />

<br />
The SECOND 'Sally Switch' was done in Part II so Robotnik could see it.
<br />
Robotnik (as well as most readers) thought that this was the first and 
<br />
only switch.
<br />

<br />
And what about Arlo and Penelope?
<br />

<br />
They were taken away by the Rebel Underground moles which literally came
<br />
up from underground.  St. John's Rebel Underground were also ment to be a 
<br />
'Safety Net' in case something unexpected came up.
<br />

<br />
The story ends with Sally trying to convince Geoffery to come with her to
<br />
Knothole.  Geoffery declines the offer because the Rebel Underground still
<br />
need him.  He does give her a passionate goodbye kiss though.  (Yo Sonic!  
<br />
Watch out!)
<br />

<br />
This is definitely one of the most complicated story Archie's 'Sonic' group
<br />
has ever come up with.  Congrats Archie Crew...  I really enjoyed it!
<br />

<br />
Horace Hawkins (14) wishes Sally a Happy Valentine's Day.  He also says

he'd like to be her boyfriend.
