<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well I received a national college magazine called U. Magazine (May)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; today and they had an article about &quot;Star-Studded Students.&quot;  Anyway to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get to the point, Jaleel White (voice of Sonic in DIC cartoons) was

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; featured and it mentioned he went to UCLA, so I loaded up UCLA's

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; student directory and sure enough he was there. 
</em><br />

<br />
The article just mentioned Jaleel's role as Steve Urkel on 'Family Matters'.
<br />
He mentioned how if a girl askes him to do an Urkel impression or imitates
<br />
Urkel by saying &quot;Did I do that?&quot; in a nasal whiney voice, then the date is
<br />
over.
<br />

<br />
I saw an interview with Jaleel and he was asked to do 'Do Urkel' (which he
<br />
refused) so I guess he gets pretty sick of it (based on personal
<br />
experience).  Back around 1985 I had done some voices for a home movie
<br />
featuring plush toys strung up like puppets.  I voiced 'Hubert' (A Hubert
<br />
Doll from the Harris Bank), and even though it was seen by only a handful
<br />
of friends and family, I had gotten sick of requests to 'do Hubert' rather
<br />
quickly. 
<br />

<br />
I can just see him coming out with a book in the year 2006 titled,
<br />
&quot;I am not Urkel&quot; after a few thousand more Urkel impression requests
<br />
where he vents his hatred for being typecast as a nerd and tells of his 
<br />
other, more serious, acting roles.
<br />

<br />
I can also see him coming out with another book in the year 2026 titled,
<br />
&quot;I am Urkel&quot;... ( alternately titled, &quot;Did I do that?&quot; ) where he lightens
<br />
up and gets over the fact that he had been typecast into 'nerd' roles.
<br />

<br />
Okay... Maybe not.  ... And now for something Sonic related:
<br />

<br />
I have to wonder if he feels the same about his role as Sonic the
<br />
Hedgehog.  I'm guessing he doesn't have as many requests for 'Sonic'
<br />
impersonations.  I also have to wonder if he thinks of 'Sonic' as 'just
<br />
another job' or if he has a greater regard for Sonic as a character. 
<br />

<br />
Its wishful thinking but I think it would be great if Jaleel White were 
<br />
to join this list even if he only posted about once a month.
