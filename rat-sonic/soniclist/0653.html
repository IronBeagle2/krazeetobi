<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And learn David most certainly did.  He found that there were
<br />
many functions to life besides his undecided role in the chain
<br />
of command.  Over the period of three weeks, David accomplished
<br />
many tasks to improve his status in his new domicile.  He
<br />
learned more about the intricacies of his organic companions'
<br />
speech and emotional displays.  He also learned how to fly,
<br />
since his endoskeleton was modeled very closely after Tails.
<br />
After some instruction from Dulcy and receiving her experience
<br />
from seeing what procedures Tails used to hover, fly, and land,
<br />
David became capable of flying to almost any location.  He
<br />
studied novels, encyclopedias, poetry, and it seemed as if there
<br />
was no way to quench David's lust for information.  He
<br />
instructed his nanites to manufacture appropriate hardware for
<br />
upgrading his survivability, and to improve the preexisting
<br />
equipment that he had built inside him.  Yet, there was one area
<br />
which he failed to complete successfully:  his relationship to
<br />
Tails.  As David built up his emotional database, that fact only
<br />
served to compile to complex and frustratingly gargantuan
<br />
proportions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, the situation was no more severe than it was on
<br />
David's first day of life.  Through an almost telepathic
<br />
agreement, for Tails had no intention of being anywhere near
<br />
David, they managed to maintain a respectable distance.  Sally
<br />
counseled him about his bind with Tails;  Sonic tried to
<br />
convince Tails to rethink his misgivings about David.  Nothing
<br />
seemed to work.  The only alternative was to permit Tails a wide
<br />
berth from David.  For a while, everything was almost perfect,
<br />
as long they did so.  However, as life would have control over
<br />
events, this status of peace would not survive for an extended
<br />
period of time.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David was pacing around the Knothole/Great Forest border near
<br />
the bridge at about 1700 hours, testing his latest sensors for
<br />
accuracy.  During his passive IR scan, he noticed a form appear
<br />
about thirty meters in front of him as he directed his head
<br />
forward.  Intrigued by this, he converted his sensors to visible
<br />
light scan, and magnified the image.  It was a young female
<br />
skunk, about Tails' age and height.  Nina saw David and ran over
<br />
to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David downloaded the required data about Nina into one of his
<br />
dynamic provisional memory storage units.  What he read he
<br />
didn't enjoy at all.  According to his data, Nina was a close
<br />
friend to Tails.  And if Tails saw David and Nina together, the
<br />
situation could become an unsettling one for all three parties.
<br />
That was one confrontation that he had no intention of
<br />
participating in.  David's stress registers increased with the
<br />
anticipated battle that would ensue if he didn't act to prevent
<br />
it.  He turned around to evade the near-future battle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too late.  Nina already had him contained in her
<br />
powerful grasp, and David had no hope of immediate salvation
<br />
except to implement his overwhelming strength.  He was unable to
<br />
do so, for any such act would critically injure Nina, and part
<br />
of his basic moralistic programming prevented him from doing so.
<br />
&nbsp;His respect for life was too strong to justify a violent
<br />
response.  Therefore, other, more civil procedures would have to
<br />
be acted on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, David!&quot; the young skunk exclaimed to him, not softening
<br />
her grip one iota.  &quot;It's so good to see you again!  It's about
<br />
time you got away from those adults and over to those your own
<br />
age!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David attempted to find a diplomatic mean of escape.  &quot;Nina, I
<br />
would very much appreciate your friendly attitude towards me, if
<br />
you would please allow me to maintain a respectable distance!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, sorry about that,&quot; she apologized, and complied with his
<br />
implied request.  &quot;It's just that I've never had a chance to see
<br />
you personally, I got a little too excited.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You aren't the only one that might get excited,&quot; David
<br />
retorted, as kindly as possible.  &quot;According to my information,
<br />
you are Tails' friend, and....Tails and I do not exactly have an
<br />
amicable relationship as of this current time.  I have no desire
<br />
to be the perpetrator of any distress between the two of you,&quot;
<br />
David stated, using all of his sensors to locate Tails before he
<br />
and Nina severely got into trouble.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was located about 300 meters away, but his location was
<br />
surrounded by trees.  It was more than likely that he would not
<br />
see David and Nina, but David wasn't inclined to take any risks.
<br />
&nbsp;He said so to Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why can't you two get along?&quot; she inquired.  &quot;From what I saw
<br />
over the past few weeks, you're not the one at fault for this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That took David completely off guard.  He was uncertain as to
<br />
how to answer Nina's question.  Of course, David wasn't at fault
<br />
for anything, except for being created.  And that, he had no
<br />
control over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never had the opportunity to answer.  Tails arrived, his
<br />
eyes silted and teeth exposed with anger.  David measured Tails'
<br />
stress levels, and found that an eruption was about to take
<br />
place, no matter what David could try to prevent it with.  His
<br />
organic counterpart stood in his position, slowly breathing with
<br />
a dangerous tension.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What...are...you...doing...with...Nina?&quot; Tails managed to
<br />
slowly spit out, unable to control the rage in his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina answered for David.  &quot;He's just talking to me;  nothing
<br />
more.  I just wanted to be friends with him after I saw him away
<br />
from all the adults here.&quot;  Her calm voice belied the anger she
<br />
was feeling toward Tails and the way he was treating David.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That doesn't matter!  He's a robot, something to take us back
<br />
to Robotropolis whenever he has the chance to!&quot; Tails barked
<br />
out, even more stressed than before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina continued as calmly as the situation would permit, &quot;No,
<br />
David's a Freedom Fighter, just like you are.  And nothing is
<br />
going to change that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David wished that he could contribute something to the
<br />
conversation, but considered the consequences beforehand.  It
<br />
would ultimately serve to further degrade the already tenuous
<br />
relationship he had with Tails.  And the condition was becoming
<br />
more precarious just from this exchange.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, what do you need to associate with a robot for?  He
<br />
doesn't have anything to give you, he's emotionless, stupid, and
<br />
the worst excuse I've ever seen for a brother!&quot;  With that last
<br />
remark, Tails ran back into the Great Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did Nina and Tails know that a storm was advancing over
<br />
the area.  And Tails was in the middle of it, unheeding of the
<br />
warnings.  David warned Nina of the situation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Someone has to go after him, at least to teach him a lesson,&quot;
<br />
Nina replied, unable to maintain the level of calm she had only
<br />
a few seconds ago.  She moved to go after him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; he ordered, extending his hand to block her path.  &quot;I'll
<br />
retrieve Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you sure about that, David?&quot; his friend asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I will have a higher probability of retrieving Tails, since I
<br />
have capabilities to utilize that you don't have available,&quot; he
<br />
answered, with a determined look on his face.  &quot;The way you can
<br />
assist me is to get help from the others in Knothole.  I require
<br />
their presence here in order to prevent the situation from
<br />
becoming critical.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She considered his orders, but said nothing further.  She knew
<br />
what the unspoken words were.  She then ran off to Knothole, as
<br />
quickly as she could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David did the same, only in the opposite direction.  With all
<br />
his sensors active, he searched for Tails as far as he could
<br />
scan.  After locating his trail, he rushed to Tails' aid.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About fifteen minutes later, David located his counterpart.
<br />
Tails was sitting on a rock, apparently unheeding of the rain
<br />
pouring down on him, and the thunder which seemed to be getting
<br />
closer every second.  Tails was also blind to David's arrival,
<br />
since he made no indication that he noticed the compuorganic
<br />
fox's presence.  Then again, in the darkness created by the
<br />
storm, David would be the only one who could view anything.  He
<br />
thought with a belated sense of worthiness that he didn't send
<br />
Nina, or tell her to send anyone after the two foxes.  They
<br />
would have become as lost as Tails appeared to be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails?&quot; he called over the thunder.  &quot;It's me, David.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get away!&quot; the other fox retorted.  &quot;We don't have anything to
<br />
talk about!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;On the contrary,&quot; David replied, maintaining his outer calm,
<br />
&quot;we have everything to discuss.  Starting with the condition
<br />
between us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's nothing I have to say to you, David!&quot; Tails yelled,
<br />
wishing that he could be alone right now and nothing else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please, Tails!&quot; David nearly pleaded.  &quot;Tell me what it is
<br />
that troubles you about me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if the very storm had tired of the confrontation between the
<br />
two foxes, a fork of lightning streaked down the sky and found
<br />
an impact point on a nearby tree.  The violated branch erupted
<br />
into flames, falling straight down on Tails' position.  He saw
<br />
the branch and instinctively crouched over, in the hope that
<br />
this would protect him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David took action to rescue Tails from a conflagration that
<br />
would otherwise consume him.  He flew up to the falling branch,
<br />
and disengaged his rotating tails.  Utilizing both of his tails,
<br />
David swatted the flaming branch, dislocating it from its lethal
<br />
flight path.  Tails was safe for now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the ground, Tails waited for the fiery death to fill his
<br />
field of vision.  It never came.  The only sounds he could hear
<br />
were the rain, thunder, and David's tails slowly returning him
<br />
from the tormented areas above ground.  He saw David stop
<br />
rotating his tails about two meters above ground, then expertly
<br />
drop to the ground, landing so that the shock would dissipate
<br />
through his body.  Tails' savior slowly walked over to him, his
<br />
face a testimony to worry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You...you really care about me?&quot; Tails asked, not trusting his
<br />
voice to sound coherent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David understood him without difficulty.  &quot;Of course I care
<br />
about you,&quot; he responded, &quot;as well as the rest of the Freedom
<br />
Fighters.  What ever gave you the impression I didn't?  Is that
<br />
what you were concerned about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails started crying, for he had overlooked something in David,
<br />
and had neglected him for so long.  He felt sorry for David, and
<br />
ashamed of himself for harboring the prejudice he had, just for
<br />
the fact that David was something of a form he had no personal
<br />
control over.  He got up and hugged David, and didn't release
<br />
his grip on him for a long time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sniffling, Tails said, &quot;I'm sorry I treated you the way I did,
<br />
David.  I just didn't know that you really cared about me so
<br />
much.  I thought you would go crazy and send us back to
<br />
Robotropolis or something.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails,&quot; David answered jovially, &quot;you know me better than
<br />
that.  Besides, even if I did want to take you back to
<br />
Robotropolis, I couldn't.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why's that?&quot; Tails inquired, the shamed look on his face
<br />
converting to one of wonder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because you're like a brother to me,&quot; David continued, &quot;and
<br />
there's no Robotropolis available for me to send you and the
<br />
rest of the Freedom Fighters to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's good to have you back.....brother.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both shared in a mutual session of laughter, then David
<br />
gradually guided his brother back to the refuge of Knothole.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, there was no indication of the adversarial state
<br />
that existed between Tails and David.  They were like two foxes
<br />
that had finally found themselves, which in this case, they did.
<br />
&nbsp;Sally and Sonic watched from a distance as they saw the two
<br />
foxes actually playing together, instead of Tails being at
<br />
David's throat, and David doing everything in his power to
<br />
escape.  They were like friends, or (dare they think it?)
<br />
brothers that were concerned for each other's welfare.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't believe it, Sonic,&quot; Sally said after the realization
<br />
struck her as to what the fox pair was doing.  &quot;It seems like
<br />
they were enemies just yesterday.  I wonder what brought Tails
<br />
out of it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't know, Sal,&quot; the hedgehog said, equally awed by the
<br />
transition.  &quot;I asked them earlier, but they wouldn't tell me
<br />
why.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe it's just as well that way.  These two are going to be a
<br />
powerful team in the future.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the condition of Tails' transition remained a secret, to
<br />
everyone in Knothole.  All that mattered now is that they loved
<br />
each other like brothers of a long acquaintance.  They both
<br />
agreed to tell everyone one thing though:  that David's name be
<br />
changed to David Prower.
