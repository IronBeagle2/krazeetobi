I just read a few messages (flames, really) in my E-mail &amp; 
<br />
on the Usenet which I am really unhappy about... This post 
<br />
is a response to those messages &amp; E-mails...
<br />
I honestly couldn't believe the poor responses I got to this
<br />
simple bit 'o creativity.  So to all those who
<br />
care: my views on the Princess &amp; why...
<br />

<br />

<br />
What in the name of Mobius is going on here!?!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drawing &quot;SALLYFOX.GIF&quot; was a response
<br />
to the long running discussion about Princess Sally's
<br />
species.  I personally am of the mind-set that she
<br />
is a fox, thus, I thought she would look good with a
<br />
nice, long tail.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I know all you comic book fans love to boast
<br />
that she is specifically referred to as a &quot;ground squirrel&quot;,
<br />
but I for one have realized that the show and comic book
<br />
have nothing to do with each other!  There are
<br />
inconsistencies between the two (discussed at nauseam)
<br />
which can only be reconciled if you think of the show,
<br />
comic book, (and any other Sonic writing) as separate 
<br />
stories with the same basic characters.  Each media is
<br />
like looking through different &quot;windows&quot; to Mobius, as 
<br />
another 'net Freedom Fighter put it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that in mind, Think of the SatAM Sonic show. 
<br />
Now, it puzzles me a great deal as to WHY the 
<br />
artists/animators/writers would have made Sally's
<br />
father a FOX if she herself was not one.  This makes
<br />
no logical sense to me.  I think it is fairly obvious 
<br />
that SOMEONE on the design team thought Sally was
<br />
a fox if they drew her father as one.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to the realization that Sally's father 
<br />
is a fox (on the show) alot of interesting theories 
<br />
suddenly popped up: &quot;Her mother was a ground squirrel&quot; 
<br />
and &quot;she was adopted&quot; are my personal favorites.  Also, a 
<br />
couple of new terms evolved: &quot;Mobian biology&quot; and &quot;cartoon 
<br />
genetics&quot; are my favs from that bunch.  All in all, I see 
<br />
this as alot of creative B.S. which attempts a rational 
<br />
explanation to this dilemma in species.  Of course, since 
<br />
there is no hint of species on the show, NO ONE (save maybe 
<br />
the artist him/herself) can argue this point.  (and since 
<br />
the show was canceled, this will never be resolved.) 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So put away your torches and flame-throwers and save
<br />
them for someone who really deserves it.  As I said, it 
<br />
doesn't make any logical sense to me for Sally to be a 
<br />
ground squirrel, but to each his own.  I'm done arguing 
<br />
this point and can accept that some people still like her
<br />
as a ground squirrel.  If you don't like what I drew, erase 
<br />
it, but don't bug me about it.  If you disagree with me, 
<br />
fine, but realize also that you may be the one who is wrong...
<br />
