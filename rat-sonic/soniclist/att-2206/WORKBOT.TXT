Now that I got that out of the way.  Time to start the story.
Note this is my first story, hope you enjoy it.
The story seems to drift from what you see to what Mechtail see's and back.
Sorry about that, every one has there own way of story telling, I'll get 
better at it as time goes on.
The time line is after Doomsday.

Chapter 1

A factory somewhere in Robotropolis is busy with life if you could call it a 
life.  Worker Bots, mindless robot slave's which were once people are busy 
working at different tasks.  Through trapped in these body's every one is 
aware of what there are doing but are helpless to stop it.   Swatbots role 
off the ensemble line ready to be activated.  A Worker Bot is busy 
assembling Swatbot heads, a metal male squirrel in his late teens.   /*Boy I 
hate my job\*  The Work Bot thinks to him self.  /*If only I could stop, but 
NOO.. I can help it, my stupid program won't let me.\* /*Just think a month 
ago I was appointed leader or was asked to be one because Alice got killed 
during a mission.  At the time I thought it was a good idea like being the 
leader of the Eastern Freedom Fighters.  /*Through we were a very small group 
I think we held up pretty well.  I never went on many mission's to robo town 
because I didn't know my way around.\*  /*The other freedoms fighters found 
it odd that I never went along on thought's missions but I told them I didn't 
want to risk the mission if I got lost.  ALL what's the use every thing went 
wrong.  If I every get out of this I'll go home and stay there."\* 

"Worker Bot #549268217 report to the roboticizer room"  Came over the loud 
speaker.  /*Ohh not a again./*  The Worker bot stopped what he was doing and 
walked out the door.  /*I really, really hate this.\* In the roboticizer room 
Swatbots are holding a young female fox.  Packbell is smiling at her.  
"You'll never get a away with this." She saids.  "Yes, yes I heard it all 
before.  Besides what can you do to stop me?"  I walk into the room to see 
a fox looking at me very frightend.  "Ahh so there you are."  Packbell said.  
"AWAITING COMMAND SIR?" I said.  /*Yes you stupid electric toaster.\*  
"Take your position." I walked up to the controls.  "I'll give you one last 
chance to tell me where the rest your friends are hiding."  "NEVER I'LL DIE 
FIRST." I could see that PAC-MAN was getting angry. "Fine then, but what 
a have in mind is worse then death. Put here in the roboticizer"  The Swatbots 
put the young fox on the platform.  Packbell looked at me.  "Well get on with 
it, activate."  My body walked infront of the control panel.  /*NOOO DON'T DO 
IT STOP AHH.. can't control my self./*  My paw pushed some buttons and the 
roboticizer started its cycle, the glass tube came down over the fox and 
yellow bolts of what looked like lighting hit her.  Less then 10 seconds later 
she was turned into a Worker Bot.  The glass tube lifted up and the new bot 
walked out.  "AWAITING COMMAND SIR?"  /*Poor girl.\*  Little did I realize 
that a tear ran down my face.  /*A tear?\*  Packbell looked at me will a 
smile "Take her to factory #254 and assign her work." "YES SIR."  /*You'll 
pay for this PAC-MAN some day you will.\* 

I walked beside her as I led her to the factory not able to speak or stop. 
/*I wish I could say something to her, to help her, something to easy her pain 
but I can't.\*  /*I do believe that Packbell knows that Worker Bots still 
think for them self's but can't do anything else, that's why he calls me to 
the roboticizer either that or because I called him PAC-MAN before he 
roboticized me.  I think he is trying to torture me, and I'm sure he likes 
doing it./*

One day while I was busy do the job I all ways hate.  Something was going on 
outside.  "Sonic what are you doing?"  Asked Sally.  "Sorry Sal I'm board."  
"Well stop it we only have to wait another minute."  Sonic stopped tapping his 
foot.  "Do you have the charges ready Sonic?"  "Yep!" "Well give me half of 
them."  "Here you go Sal."  As he handed the bombs to Sally.  "There it is, 
Sonic, Power Station #12" Sally said.  "I see it, are you ready Sal?"  "Yes I 
got my new boots on, remember.   Here put Nicole in your back pack I have no 
room in mine. " And removing Nicole from the harness on her leg and gave it to 
Sonic.  There can be heard a small explosion a distance away.  "Ok it worked 
the Swatbots are leaving there post."  Sonic and Sally gave each other a 
kiss.  Then the two of them ran down towards the station and split into two 
different directions.  They entered the station, Sonic zipped into the front 
Sally in the back.  

Snively saw them enter the building from the control room.  Packbell was with 
him.  "There going to blow up my Power Station, DO SOMETHING!" Snively said to 
Packbell.  Packbell looked at Snively "No Swatbot would get there in time, 
even if they did, it is unlikely they will be able to catch them.  But I can 
seal them in the building, if the Station blows they will go with it."  There 
was smile on Packbell face as he hit a switch.  Sonic just lad down the last 
charge which was set to blow in 15 seconds.  Sonic whistled to Sally then the 
timers started.  Sonic look around, and to his horror, saw that the doors were 
closing.  "SAL THE DOORS! RUN!!!!"  Sonic ran as fast as he could towards the 
door,  he saw that Sally was right behind him.  Sonic ran outside,  Sally 
could see the door closing, there was enough time to make it through.  As she 
was running for the door her foot hit something and she tripped.  Sonic was 
going so fast that he was 25 feet from the door before he came to a stop to 
see Sally behind him, but she wasn't behind him.  "SAL!!!!"  Running back, the 
door shut.  "NOO SAL!"  Sonic did a triple spin trying to cut through the 
door. BOOOOOOM!!!!  Sonic was blown away from the blast a good 200 feet.  
Sonic looked as the building collapsed.  "SALLY!!"  Then Sonic passed out.
Dulcy found Sonic laying on the ground and pick him up and flew back into the
Great Forest.

Later Sonic woke up in Knot Hole.  "Sonic where's Aunt Sally?" asked Tails.
