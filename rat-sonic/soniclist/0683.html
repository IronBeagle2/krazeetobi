<br />
Part 1.
<br />

<br />
5/13/3224, early evening.
<br />
Mobotropolis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean was nervous.  Tonight was supposed to be a big night.  The 
<br />
Great War was finally over, and the King was throwing a celebration to, 
<br />
among other things, congratulate the Minister of War, Julian, and 
<br />
reappoint him as Minister of Science.  Jean, who was a member of the 
<br />
Palace Guard, had been asked, along with several others, to work late 
<br />
this evening to watch over the ceremonies.  It was supposed to be a 
<br />
joyous occasion, but still, Jean was nervous.  There was something that 
<br />
just was not right.  Julian had seemed less than enthusiastic about his 
<br />
change of jobs lately, and Jean had felt tension mounting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean stood his post, looking out over the city, when he noticed 
<br />
something that made his heart stop.  A huge fleet of hovercraft, flying 
<br />
ships of all shapes and sizes, were headed straight for the palace!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gods of Mobius!&quot; he thought.  &quot;What is that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, he had an answer.  At the same time, all hell 
<br />
broke loose.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley, Jean's beloved wife and a pretty 25-year-old brown-furred 
<br />
fox, was busy scrolling through today's e-mail when the telecommunicator 
<br />
buzzed.  She pressed the answer button, and her &quot;handsome fox of a 
<br />
husband&quot; appeared on the screen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, honey, how's the---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Listen, Shirley.  Something's happened.  I can't explain it, but 
<br />
get out of the city.  Get Tolouse, get the neighbors if you can, but do 
<br />
it quickly.  I repeat, GET OUT OF THE CITY!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley saw a look of fear that she had never seen before in her 
<br />
husband's face.  &quot;Jean, what is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just do it now!  Julian has gone insane, and...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean was interrupted by a huge crash behind him, and by a robotic 
<br />
voice saying &quot;You are under arrest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GET OUT OF THE CITY, PLEASE!&quot; Jean shouted.  &quot;GET OUT---&quot; and the 
<br />
screen went dead.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley could not believe what she just saw, but she had no reason 
<br />
to doubt Jean, especially after looking into his eyes, petrified with 
<br />
fear.  She quickly got up from the console and ran to Tolouse's room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Honey, wake up!&quot; she said, but before he could respond she already 
<br />
had her 4-year-old son cradled in her arms, and was running out the 
<br />
door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mommy, what's wrong?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No time, baby.  We've got to leave.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right as she opened the front door, an immense explosion rocked the 
<br />
city.  She looked out and in the distance, she saw the palace, falling 
<br />
to pieces.  &quot;Jean!&quot; she screamed.  But there was no time to wonder what 
<br />
on Mobius was going on.  All around her, people stared at the palace in 
<br />
utter confusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley tried to make her voice as firm as possible.  &quot;Everybody, 
<br />
listen!  We've got to get out of here!  My hovercar, now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shirley, do you know---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NOW!  Jean said something's happened at the palace, but I don't 
<br />
want to be here to find out!  Are you with me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people who heard her followed her to the hovercar.  
<br />
Shirley had been fortunate that Jean got one with plenty of storage 
<br />
space to transport the various projects he was always working on.  Now 
<br />
it would be a means of escape for many people.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 20 bodies were compacted into the storage space when somebody 
<br />
noticed something approaching.  &quot;Shirley, we've got company!  Gun it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked over and saw a whole army of robot patrollers coming 
<br />
up the road, followed by angry-looking hovercraft she had never seen 
<br />
before.  The robot patrollers (whom would later be known as the infamous 
<br />
SWAT-Bots) were grabbing every person they could and stowing them in the 
<br />
hovercraft.  With the doors still open, Shirley maxed the accelerator, 
<br />
and the hovercar rose in the air and zoomed down the street.  Down 
<br />
below, she could hear the cries of the people, who had seen the robot 
<br />
patrollers and now saw her hovercar, begging to be taken.  There was no 
<br />
time.  She closed the doors in bitter heartbreak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mommy?&quot;  Shirley looked down and saw Tolouse sitting in her lap, 
<br />
eyes wide and full of fear.  He looked just like his father did.  &quot;It's 
<br />
okay, honey.  It's okay.&quot;  She did not believe it herself, but she could 
<br />
not think of anything else to tell him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right then, somebody screamed, &quot;Shirley!  Look ahead!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 200 feet ahead, several robot patrollers were standing in the 
<br />
street, forming a roadblock.  There was no way around them!  Shirley 
<br />
knew she couldn't stop now.  She gritted her teeth, closed her eyes, and 
<br />
maxed the accelerator.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A robotic voice said, &quot;Halt your vehicle by order of---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHAM!!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovercar lurched wildly, and several windows shattered, but the 
<br />
hovercar remained intact and in the air.  Behind them, the frightened 
<br />
occupants heard laser fire, but by some miracle the hovercar made it 
<br />
through to the city limits, speeding towards the Great Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was crying, as was several of the occupants of the 
<br />
hovercar.  By now Shirley was too dazed to do anything but drive, hoping 
<br />
they would reach safety.  Wherever that was.
<br />

<br />
As nighttime approached, the hovercar sped along through the Great 
<br />
Forest.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean was one of the first citizens of Mobotropolis to be 
<br />
roboticized that night.  Julian's (now Ivo Robotnik) coup had been a 
<br />
success, and his tyrannical rule had begun.
<br />
