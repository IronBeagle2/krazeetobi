In response to statements that the FAQ File has become too much of a
<br />
good thing, I'm going to try a cut-and-paste posting approach.  I guess
<br />
I'll let the custodians of Sonic home pages which carry the file worry
<br />
about keeping the whole thing available.

Frequently Asked Questions
<br />

<br />
10) Why was Rotor called &quot;Boomer&quot; in the early comics?
<br />
They finally got around to providing an answer to this one in Sonic #29
<br />
(Dec 1995).  The explanation: &quot;Rotor is Rotor's real name.  Boomer was
<br />
something we used to call him when we were kids to make fun of his
<br />
voice.&quot;  So basically we're supposed to believe &quot;Boomer&quot; is really
<br />
Rotor's nickname.
<br />

<br />
=======================================================================
<br />

<br />
#29 [Dec 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Better double-bag this one, gang; it's a keeper for a
<br />
number of reasons.  DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover by Spaziante -- this stunning work alone deserves
<br />
recognition!  Not as powerful as the roboticization of Sally
<br />
sequence in &quot;Sonic's Nightmare&quot; but close enough.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Steel-belted Sally&quot; (three parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a one-page introduction to Dulcy (which was more than
<br />
she got when she debuted in the second season), we move on to the
<br />
story.  Sonic finds a &quot;portable deroboticizer&quot;(!!!) in a crashed
<br />
hover unit.  So Rotor takes it apart, figures out how it works,
<br />
begins mass-producing them, the residents of Mobius are
<br />
deroboticized and they drive Robotnik off the planet.  Wrong
<br />
answer!  Instead, Sally allows herself to be captured by Robotnik
<br />
and roboticized, trusting in a small disc that looks like a
<br />
battery for a calculator that's supposed to prevent her mind from
<br />
coming under Robotnik's influence after being roboticized. 
<br />
Unfortunately, the &quot;neuro-overrider&quot; falls off and Sally is
<br />
totally transformed.  As the others are on the verge of being
<br />
roboticized by Robo-Sally, Dulcy shows up and uses the portable
<br />
deroboticizer (remember THAT plot device?) to restore Sally and
<br />
foil Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good artwork by Mawhinney, but readers have been quick to
<br />
point out the flaws in the plot of the story.  Why NOT use the
<br />
portable deroboticizer to restore Bunnie, or even Uncle Chuck
<br />
(scheduled to appear in issue #30)?  After it's used on Sally
<br />
it's never heard of again; shabby treatment for a pivotal device. 
<br />
And why wasn't the neuro-overrider more securely fastened to
<br />
Sally?  They couldn't find a bobby pin?  They never heard of
<br />
super glue?  They couldn't take the time to surgically implant
<br />
the thing?  And finally, whose idea was it at Archie Comics to
<br />
have Bunnie wearing metallic panties?  Her legion of fanboys are
<br />
glad she's putting in more of an appearance, but how about
<br />
keeping her on-model?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic Art: Reid Price's drawing of the girls elicited some
<br />
comment because of the tattoos and pierced ears.  Still a pale
<br />
imitation of the erotic &quot;Bambioids&quot; of Jerry Collins which are at
<br />
<a href="ftp://avatar.snc.edu/pub/furry/images/downloads/j/jc">ftp://avatar.snc.edu/pub/furry/images/downloads/j/jc</a>[001 through
<br />
108].gif.  Of this collection I am in awe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Growing Pains, Part 2&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we last left Tails, he had been betrayed by his new
<br />
girlfriend, Fiona, who turned out to be one of Robotnik's
<br />
automatons.  Tails has just been consigned to the desert island's
<br />
roboticizer.  Fasten your safety belts, return seats and tray
<br />
tables to their upright position and assume the crash landing
<br />
position: a promising story is about to go down in flames....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roboticizer explodes because of &quot;fur from [Tails']
<br />
tails.&quot;  Wonder why this problem never came up when Robotnik was
<br />
roboticizing other furries; next time, Ivo, don't put your
<br />
prisoners in the air intake.  Fiona attacks Tails, who is then
<br />
almost crushed boa-style by one of Robotnik's palm trees.  Fiona
<br />
attacks again and attemps to drown Tails in the shallows. 
<br />
However, before she can finish the job she grinds to a halt. 
<br />
Apparently she is able to rust solid in a matter of seconds. 
<br />
Tails should have noticed this little problem when he and Fiona
<br />
were running along the beach during the romantic interlude on
<br />
page 5 of Part 1, but maybe Tails and Gallagher both learned
<br />
story structure and continuity from the same teacher.  While
<br />
Tails mourns his lost (or at least immobilized) love in
<br />
unbelievably heavy-handed prose, Robotnik escapes.  Tails may be
<br />
blue, but he's also green: he starts picking up the trash along
<br />
the beach.  This is how he discovers &quot;absolute proof&quot; that O.J.
<br />
Simpson murdered Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman...oops, wrong
<br />
story.  What he discovers is &quot;absolute proof&quot; of a &quot;satellite
<br />
operation functioning on the other side of Mobius.&quot;  Same level
<br />
of credibility, IMHO.  Having been handed the premise of his
<br />
miniseries on a silver plate without any connection whatever to
<br />
the two-parter he just endured, Tails is off on his solo
<br />
adventure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This isn't Shakespeare, Heaven only knows...it isn't even
<br />
Bacon, but Tails' acting in this story is 100% ham!  In writing
<br />
for comics you have to take shortcuts, and sometimes you have to
<br />
put massive amounts of plot development into a couple of word
<br />
balloons.  &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, however, manages to wade through 15
<br />
pages before setting up the plot of the miniseries on the very
<br />
last page.  Which wouldn't be so unforgivable if the dialogue
<br />
that preceeded it weren't so extravagent.  &quot;I'll put you here as
<br />
a monument to my lost youth...but I'll make him repair you and
<br />
we'll be together again, my love!&quot;  Typical 10-year-old, right?  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, when did you totally give up on this story?  I managed
<br />
to hang in until page 7.  When I got to the line &quot;Robotnik
<br />
created the perfect woman, but forgot to waterproof her!&quot;, I knew
<br />
this was the cue for Sonic's line: &quot;I think I shall hurl!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What galls me is the promise with which the story began. 
<br />
It's easy to tell the Trekkers in the audience because after Part
<br />
1 they've been rooting for Fiona to switch allegiances and join
<br />
up with Tails (call it the Mr. Data Effect).  The questions
<br />
raised by Part 1 were full of promise: Will Fiona cross over and
<br />
join the Freedom Fighters?  Did Tails get to second base with
<br />
Fiona during their romantic interlude?  The readers were ready to
<br />
grant Gallagher and Manak a lot of latitude in the beginning, but
<br />
the second part was a total bringdown.  The traps were
<br />
unbelievable, Fiona was written out of the story too easily, and
<br />
Tails was stuck with some of the most melodramatic lines this
<br />
side of Yiddish theater.  And by the last page you had the sense
<br />
of &quot;Forget it, let's get on to the miniseries.&quot;  With more
<br />
thought to the story, &quot;Growing Pains&quot; could have been a decent
<br />
miniseries in its own right, ending with a Tails whose character
<br />
has actually grown by the end of the story.  It's a bad sign when
<br />
the readers take the story more seriously than the writer!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic Grams: For the last time, guys, LOSE THE OFFICE HUMOR! 
<br />
We buy the product so we can read about Sonic and Tails, not
<br />
Scott and Paul.  Buried in Scott's prose is the news that despite
<br />
the Spaziante covers, the team who perpetrated &quot;Growing Pains&quot;,
<br />
Gallagher and Manak, will be doing the Tails miniseries!  So much
<br />
for anticipation.  Can you say &quot;coherency?&quot;  More important, can
<br />
you DO coherency?  November promises Sonic #30 and the return of
<br />
Uncle Chuck, Tails miniseries #2, and the Knuckles Chaotix
<br />
special, just in time for your holiday shopping.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On to the letters themselves, and these stuck in my craw
<br />
even more than the flaws in &quot;Growing Pains.&quot;  First they punt a
<br />
question on whether Tails is 5 or 10 years old, then they run a
<br />
letter to Dylan, then they casually mention that Antoine is 18
<br />
(without offering any proof that he's older than the rest), and
<br />
even though they go some ways in explaining the Boomer/Rotor name
<br />
game they have to deal with a question about Sonic and Robotnik
<br />
being half-sibs.  Two words: PUH-LEEEZE!
<br />
