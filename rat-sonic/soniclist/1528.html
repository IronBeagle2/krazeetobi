&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 9
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!&quot; Sally screamed.  &quot;Run!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And run he did.  Holding onto the mysterious ring, he found
<br />
himself running as he'd never run before.  He was travelling at a
<br />
fast that went &quot;way past fast&quot;--that was the only way he could
<br />
describe it later on.  The scenery around him was an indistinct
<br />
blur of colors.  Nothing looked normal, but it didn't make any
<br />
difference to Sonic.  He was incapable of feeling any fear.  And
<br />
there was no word at all to describe the exhilaration, the rush,
<br />
the joy he felt as he ran.  It was all of that and more.  He had
<br />
to tell somebody!  Without thinking, he turned and raced back the
<br />
way he had come.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to the spot he had left but the others weren't
<br />
there.  They were about a hundred yards up the street, sprawled
<br />
on the ground.  They were covered with dust and their hairs were
<br />
going in every direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  What happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are what has been happened!&quot; Antoine sputtered.  &quot;You
<br />
and your silly showing-off type behavior.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what?  What's he talking about, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean you don't know?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Know about what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, something happened when you ran away.  There was
<br />
this explosion and it was as if...I don't know how to describe
<br />
it...as if you were pulling the air around us after you!  It
<br />
knocked us all off our feet!  I've never felt anything like it,
<br />
not even during the worst storm!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And check THIS out!&quot; Rotor added as he examined the pieces
<br />
of what had been at least one of the SWATbots.  &quot;These bots got
<br />
tossed around like they were nothing.  They hit walls and
<br />
lampposts and BAM!, started flying to pieces.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what happened?&quot; Sonic repeated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine was right the first time,&quot; Sally said in a voice
<br />
filled with awe, &quot;YOU happened!  I don't know how you did it, but
<br />
your speed saved our lives.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oui, but we are not being back in the woods yet!  What if
<br />
there are more of these terrible things on the approach?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, they heard in the distance the warble of a siren.
<br />
That meant more SWATbots were on the way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on!  We've got to get out of here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Uncle Chuck's...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck's will be the first place they look for us,
<br />
Sonic.  We'll hide in one of those row houses.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children ran to the end of the block, where several old
<br />
row houses stood.  The doors had fallen off long ago and the
<br />
windows were just empty rectangles.  They dashed into what had
<br />
once been someone's living room.  Sally instructed them to lay
<br />
down on the floor in the shadows of the room.  Colored lights
<br />
from a SWATbot hover unit shone through the window spaces and
<br />
danced on the bare walls.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what, Sal?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait here,&quot; Sally whispered.  I'm going to check it out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally slowly crawled toward the front door, inching along
<br />
through the dust.  Tails began to shiver with fear, but Sonic
<br />
held onto his hand.  At the doorway, Sally peered around the
<br />
corner of the doorway and down the street.  She knew that she
<br />
presented such a low profile that it would be difficult to see
<br />
her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How bad is it, Sal?&quot; Sonic whispered.  For a moment, Sally
<br />
didn't say anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's bad, Sonic.  And it just got worse.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!&quot; Dr. Robotnik bellowed as he strode out of his
<br />
hover unit.  This brought his nephew and lackey out right behind
<br />
him.  &quot;What is this place?  It looks familiar.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This used to be the workshop of Sir Charles Hedgehog.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, yes.  I've sometimes thought that this place hadn't
<br />
yielded up all its secrets.  And where are the SWATbots who are
<br />
supposed to be patrolling this sector?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It appears that something happened to them just before they
<br />
went offline,&quot; he said as he began picking up some of the bot
<br />
debris.  &quot;I can retrieve their black boxes if you like, and....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't waste my time with that!  Something happened to those
<br />
SWATbots, and it happened to them here.  Bring in the SWATbots
<br />
from the adjoining two sectors: I want a house-by-house search of
<br />
this street!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At once, Sir!&quot; Snively said before disappearing back into
<br />
the hover unit.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 10
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're dead!&quot; Bunnie began to whimper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stop it, Bunnie!&quot; Sally whispered, for she had rejoined the
<br />
others.  &quot;We can get out of this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got a plan?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As a matter of fact, I do.  The Willow Tree Diversion.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Time out, Sal!&quot; Sonic whispered.  &quot;This ain't no game!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, that's what I wanted to tell you!  Look out the
<br />
window.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic edged toward the window, keeping to the shadows of the
<br />
room.  Sally stayed next to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Isn't the street from here to Uncle Chuck's workshop about
<br />
the same size as the southern meadow?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, sort of.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And the door is exactly where the willow tree stands.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, yeah!  And that mailbox is about where the old stump
<br />
is!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what Julayla was trying to show me: that I've been
<br />
rebuilding Mobotropolis all along, carrying it in my mind.  Even
<br />
when we were playing Capture The Flag, it was our way of
<br />
practicing to take Mobotropolis back.  And now that we're here,
<br />
we just have to remember how we practiced it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think this'll work, Sal?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;With one or two modifications, it should work perfectly. 
<br />
Sonic, check to see if the alley behind these houses is clear. 
<br />
Bunnie and Antoine, you'll be running the play.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can I help too, Aunt Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You bet, Tails!&quot; Sonic said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, he's too young to be taking chances like that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;News flash, Sal: we're ALL too young!  Besides, we've been
<br />
working on a little...surprise.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, here come my SWATbots now,&quot; Robotnik said as two hover
<br />
units landed.  Their doors opened and two SWATbots emerged from
<br />
each craft.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deploy the SWATbots along both sides of this street, two to
<br />
a block.  Have them search every....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's instructions were interrupted as he looked down
<br />
what he thought was a deserted street.  Something moved.  It
<br />
was small, about the size of a young fox, and it moved fast.  It
<br />
darted out of a doorway and then darted into another one just a
<br />
few feet down the street.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you see that, Snively?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then send the SWATbots after it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At once, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before Snively could do so, another figure -- this one
<br />
more like a young rabbit -- emerged from yet another doorway in
<br />
the same block of row houses.  Once more, it ran a short distance
<br />
before ducking into yet another doorway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm...awaiting your orders, sir,&quot; Snively said with some
<br />
nervousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There appears to be more than one intruder, and they're
<br />
moving away from Sir Charles's house.  It could be...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik let his sentence go unfinished as the first figure 
<br />
emerged from a doorway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind strategy; AFTER THAT INTRUDER!&quot;  Robotnik,
<br />
Snively and the SWATbots began to give chase on foot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure disappeared into the shadows of yet one more
<br />
doorway.  As Robotnik approached, still another figure emerged
<br />
from the last doorway.  Robotnik's eyebrows shot up in surprise. 
<br />
It was a young hedgehog, perhaps about ten years old.  The child
<br />
strode to the middle of the street, put his hands on his hips and
<br />
addressed Robotnik: &quot;Hold it right there, Buttnik!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's 'ROBOTNIK', you impudent brat!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what I said, 'RoBUTTnik!'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know you,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;you're that nephew of Sir
<br />
Charles Hedgehog, the one who got away from me.  I remember you
<br />
VERY well,&quot; he said as he massaged his roboticized left arm, a
<br />
painful reminder of their first encounter.  &quot;Where have you been
<br />
hiding?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's for me to know and you to find out.  NOT!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why you fresh-mouthed upstart!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, if you want a piece of me, come and get me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik drew closer to the young hedgehog, who made a point
<br />
of crossing his arms and whistling nothing in particular.  He
<br />
showed no fear, and this infuriated Robotnik all the more. 
<br />
Robotnik could have been more apprehensive, but suddenly all he
<br />
could think of was settling an old score by getting his hands on
<br />
the boy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik wasn't ten feet from Sonic when the hedgehog yelled
<br />
out &quot;NOW!&quot;  Sonic looked up and Robotnik followed his gaze.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something was hovering in the air about 30 feet above them,
<br />
something small and tawny-colored.  It dropped a bright object
<br />
which Sonic caught in a jump.  The next thing Robotnik knew, the
<br />
air around him was swirling around and he was knocked off his
<br />
feet.  Looking to where Sonic had been, he saw that Sonic had
<br />
moved, in less than a second, the length of a city block.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, slow poke!&quot; Sonic taunted.  &quot;What's the matter, time
<br />
for your beauty sleep?  You NEED one, fella!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speechless with surprise and anger, Robotnik picked himself
<br />
off the ground.  Snively was doing the same.  The SWATbots that
<br />
were with them, though, lay in pieces nearby.  Robotnik
<br />
scrambled back to his hover unit.  &quot;Get that hedgehog now,
<br />
Snively!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Sir....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO BUTS!  I want him and that ring he's carrying!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Robotnik on board, Snively took off after Sonic in the
<br />
hover unit as Sonic began to lead them a merry chase.  No matter
<br />
how fast Snively drove the hovercraft, the hedgehog on foot was
<br />
always just a little bit faster.  Robotnik didn't know how the
<br />
boy did it, and he didn't care; he would have his answers when
<br />
Sonic was caught.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik also didn't know that the moment the hover unit
<br />
left the scene, Sally and Rotor emerged from their hiding place
<br />
in one of the row houses and ran back into Uncle Chuck's
<br />
workshop.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perfect, Sally!  The Willow Tree Diversion never worked
<br />
better!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's just hope Sonic can keep from getting caught.  Now,
<br />
help me remove the power stone from this unit.  Then we can meet
<br />
the others back at the garbage dump.&quot;  She placed her hand on the
<br />
outside of the machine, then yelped and drew her hand away
<br />
quickly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That hatch is red hot!  Looks like Sonic's Uncle Chuck
<br />
didn't have his coolant problem solved after all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, he DID solve it!&quot; Rotor said with sudden realization. 
<br />
&quot;Now I know where I've seen this before: at the bottom of the
<br />
pool back in Knothole.  He must have built a water-cooled version
<br />
and installed it in Knothole before Robotnik took over.  This must
<br />
be his prototype!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But how do we get the power stone out so we can get it back
<br />
to Knothole?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The best way is to turn the machine back on.  It'll probably
<br />
overheat, malfunction and shut itself down.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Won't that harm the crystal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, you don't have to worry about that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great!&quot; Sally said as she threw the power switch on the
<br />
machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What you DO have to worry about,&quot; Rotor added, &quot;is the
<br />
possibility of this unit exploding.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHAT!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some of those old components have gotten pretty unstable
<br />
over the years; they could act as bombs if the unit overheats.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, how bad could it be?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The worst that can happen is it'll take out a block or two.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A block or...!&quot;  Sally reached for the power switch. 
<br />
&quot;Rotor!  The switch is jammed; I can't shut it off!!&quot;
