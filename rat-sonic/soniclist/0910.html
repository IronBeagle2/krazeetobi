Here I go again, replying to another of Ron's posts with my unique POV... :)
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Date: Thu, 4 May 1995 19:04:33 -0400 (EDT)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From: &quot;Erich Schulman (KTN4CA) -- Team OS/2&quot; &lt;acme_at_use.usit.net&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This question pertains to Archie Comics Sonic issue #24 and would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;considered to contain a spoiler if you want to know nothing at all about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;the story before reading the comic yourself.  My copy finally arrived today.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Here's a form feed for extra protection :^)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by &quot;Sally&quot; in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;beginning of the story?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No, but she is kind of cute (no Buttermilk Slappy though...)
</em><br />

<br />
Cute, yes, but a bit on the young side for me- I think she's about 12 here..
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:
</em><br />

<br />
And my um, comments thereof follows.... Be prepared: I'm not kind today!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When Hedgehogs Collide!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; written by Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Pencils by Dave Manak (Chapters 1 and 2) and Art  Mawhinney (Chapters 3 and 4)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Inks by Harvo (??)    (Chapters 1 and 2) and Rich Koslowski (Chapters 3 and 4)
</em><br />

<br />
In general, not very well drawn in alot of spots, though there were some 
<br />
good points, though... Writing could've been better, too. Nowhere *near* 
<br />
the calibre of work put into the Princess Sally miniseries, 
<br />
unfortunately! :(
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; medieval village - various vendors selling stuff in the &quot;town square&quot;, etc.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run around in motorized vehicles?)
</em><br />

<br />
I was rather bothered by these two factors, myself, considering (a) 
<br />
they're in our future, and (b) Knothole has always been, in the DiC 
<br />
cartoons (my exposure, natch), to be a makeshift rebel compound, and not 
<br />
a self-contained community.... Considering Archie is taking up the reigns 
<br />
in presenting the Sonic universe after the cancellation of the DiC 
<br />
cartoons, and the big draw is *coming* from the DiC SatAM audience, it's 
<br />
disconcerting at best....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robotnik is a &quot;kindly ol'... grade-A wimp!&quot;, and the SWATbots do all the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; work, so life is boring (at least for bad guys like these).  So they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; decided for kicks to come to &quot;our dimension&quot; (rather handy how they can hop 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the &quot;cosmic interstate&quot; whenever they want) and make trouble for our 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heroes.  Drooling fanboys should note that this chapter has a few shots of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)
</em><br />

<br />
Chapter 2 was an overall improvement after Ch. 1- In the beginning, at 
<br />
least. There *are* certain .fandom-esque notes to be made here, 
<br />
particularly of Sally (as mentioned) and of course, Sonic's desk! Turning 
<br />
the scene upside-down and read from left to right we have:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic      Sonic      Sonic      Sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+          +          +          +
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally      Bunnie     Nicole     Sonic
<br />

<br />
The first, obviously was no surprise and the second caught me off-guard, 
<br />
not expecting seeing something I suspected being confirmed (yeah, I know; 
<br />
alternate world, but there are parallels between the two Sonics, 
<br />
including interests and egos!); however, I was *totally* surprised by the 
<br />
latter two, and had me ROTFLing! :) (But then again, Sonic *does* love 
<br />
himself!- It's Nicole that caught me off-guard here! :) )
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Antoine come through Rotor's &quot;Timespace Matter Projector&quot; (TM) back from 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;negative reality&quot;, but couldn't &quot;pierce the ZONE OF SILENCE where Robotnik 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exiled Sally's dad KING ACORN!&quot;  ????  Nice exchange between Sonic and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nicole here...
</em><br />

<br />
Mediocre chapter here.....
<br />

<br />
[....]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;Sonic art&quot; pinup is nothing special.
</em><br />

<br />
Agreed.....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;leathers&quot;; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  
</em><br />

<br />
This chapter had some considerable improvement overall, notably in the 
<br />
art, notably in this splash page... And yes, Bunnie is conspicuous by her 
<br />
absense in this comic. I think it's probably because the issue is a 
<br />
regression to the style of the *syndicated* DiC cartoon, which the comic 
<br />
series was initially based on..
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The imposters decide to attack a band of &quot;poor innocent gypsies&quot; who, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matched, so Sally yells &quot;Change partners!&quot; and this does the job.
</em><br />

<br />
Third .fandom-esque note: Sally *in* a skirt- Then she takes the skirt off!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic &quot;game over - you lose!&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and he gets the reply: &quot;Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came for!  A fight!&quot;  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with himself, and he replies &quot;Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!&quot;
</em><br />

<br />
The fight was so-so; the ending was a typical Sonic statement, though it 
<br />
would've been something he would've been more upbeat about...
<br />

<br />
Frankly, I didn't care much for the story. OK, I've been spoiled rotten 
<br />
by the SatAM DiC cartoon, and the Princess Sally miniseries, and most of 
<br />
the fanfic written *so far* has been better than *this*.... Come on, 
<br />
fellas! I'd rather have the quality of the Princess Sally miniseries over 
<br />
*this!* :(
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more enthused about either...
</em><br />

<br />
Same here....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)
</em><br />

<br />
&quot;Ah-hah! Pronoun trouble!&quot; :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...
</em><br />

<br />
That's okay- I just went through 1-1/2 Art Of Noice CDs typing this 
<br />
reply.... That's an hour, mind you..... (OK, so I'm slow... Nothing new 
<br />
about *that*....)
<br />

<br />
.....Quozl!
<br />
