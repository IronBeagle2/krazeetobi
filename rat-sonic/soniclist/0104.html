My first thought after seeing that there was a Sonic mailing list
<br />
available:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Cool.  Maybe I can learn a little more about the games and possibly
<br />
find out if the cartoon is worth watching.&quot;
<br />

<br />
My first thought after receiving the welcome file:
<br />

<br />
&quot;That was quick!  Less than two minutes!&quot;
<br />

<br />
My first thought after viewing my first round of messages:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sonic, Tails, waitaminute...who in the world is Sally?&quot;
<br />

<br />
That'll teach me to skim thru and quickly file away the &quot;Welcome&quot;!
<br />
But now, a few days later, I've become enlightened to what this group
<br />
is really about.  And (needless to say?) I am entranced.
<br />

<br />
Y'see, I've always had a fascination for animal fiction.  I list
<br />
_Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH_ as one of my all-time favorite books,
<br />
I've enjoyed just about every movie that Don Bluth has put out
<br />
(at least until Rock-a-Doodle), and I kept up with the weekday cartoon
<br />
of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, before the writers ditched the
<br />
continuity and turned it into the usual children's cartoon drivel.
<br />
One of these days, I'm gonna find a copy of _Watership Down_ to read,
<br />
since it's been almost a decade since I last saw the movie.
<br />
And need I mention the excellent tongue-in-cheek humor of the
<br />
Animaniacs?  I'm even attempting to create my own such fiction,
<br />
with one story revolving around Felicia, the cat-woman from the
<br />
video game &quot;Dark Stalkers.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, such works are few and far between.  So, when something
<br />
new comes along that promises good story telling involving such 
<br />
&quot;humanly animal&quot; characters, I'm all ears.  And what a story &quot;StH&quot; is!
<br />
A small, renegade group of animals doing whatever they can to stay
<br />
alive and fight against an evil, Hitler-esque ruler.  This battle
<br />
has raged on for more than a decade.  Families have been lost, friendships
<br />
torn apart.  Of the main characters, one has had to helplessly watch her
<br />
father's kingdom plundered and run into the ground, another lost his
<br />
entire family barely after he learned how to talk, and still another
<br />
questions exactly what he is fighting for or against, when the bad guys
<br />
don't seem to pay him any attention, and the good guys chastise him for
<br />
his accidental nature (sorta like Harold Lauder from _The Stand_).
<br />
Combine all this with the sci-fi/fantasy setting of powerful, mysterious
<br />
crystals and the cruel combination of biology and technology...
<br />
THIS is the stuff of classic literature!!
<br />

<br />
And so, I dove in...or at least attempted to.
<br />

<br />
It seems I'm having a little trouble getting my &quot;Sonic fixes&quot;.  After
<br />
looking in the TV Guide, I found out our local ABC affiliate has
<br />
dropped almost the entire Sat. morning line-up for a news program.
<br />
Some of the shows got farmed out to local independant channels, but
<br />
&quot;StH&quot; is lost in the cracks.
<br />

<br />
Then, I went out to one of Atlanta's most reknown comic book stores,
<br />
&quot;Oxford Comics&quot; and bought all I could find---which turned out to
<br />
be only two issues, #17 and #21.  And after reading these two and reading
<br />
the synapses of the cartoon shows from the Sonic FAQ, it looks that the
<br />
cartoon pays much better attention to the story telling than the
<br />
comic book does (why in the world did Archie Publications have to
<br />
pick this one up?!).  Oh well, I'll keep trying.
<br />

<br />
And so, I have a request.  Does anyone know if the cartoons have
<br />
been released on video yet?  If not, does anyone happen to have
<br />
the cartoons taped, and would be willing to mail me a copy?  I'd
<br />
gladly pay the cost of videotape and shipping.
<br />

<br />
Well, sorry if this intro went a little overboard, but I just wanted
<br />
to convey what an excellent forum this is.  Here's hoping there'll
<br />
be a 3rd season to the show, and that Channel 2 will finally start
<br />
showing the _at_#$^$% things!! :-)
<br />

<br />
later---Kris
<br />
