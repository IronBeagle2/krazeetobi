Having read the comments someone made about Gonterman's fanfic, and
<br />
specifically the comments made about his anti-anti-CDA stance
<br />
that was contained within it, I am driven to reply to it in a fashion
<br />
which I reserve exclusively for such inflammatory prose.
<br />

<br />
Sir, do you wish to say that you would take away David's right to
<br />
free expression, just because it *supports* the limitation of said
<br />
right?  Do you not wish to support the total right of every American 
<br />
citizen to hold the feelings and thoughts reguarding politics that our
<br />
Founding Fathers won in those hard years of the late 1700s?
<br />

<br />
If you do, use every means at your disposal to force, cajole, coerce, and
<br />
pretty much make David remove his political comments from his page.
<br />
Also, please stop supporting the anti-CDA movement.  It is obvious
<br />
that you don't understand what free speech is to begin with.
<br />

<br />
Some may ask themselves around now why I would be assisting someone
<br />
like David, whose views I do not condone or support.  The reason for
<br />
my actions here are as simple as the monitor in front of your face;
<br />
free speech, whether I agree with it or not, is something I would
<br />
willingly die for.  It is the right of every American: AOLer or
<br />
Freenetter, Republican or Democrat, White or Black, or any other
<br />
differing groups you can name.  Sure, David's views chafe with mine.
<br />
Mine chafe with him.  That's what makes America great!  Not the fact
<br />
that we are alike, but the fact that we are DIFFERENT.
<br />

<br />
In his own way, David is a patriot for having the guts to support an
<br />
unpopular opinion in the face of massive (at least, within his peer group)
<br />
resistance to it.  He could have easily joined the crowd like some
<br />
have done out of sheer instinct, without understanding the implications
<br />
or the true meaning of 'free speech'.  However, he followed his own
<br />
beliefs (even though I find them to be odd) and did what he thought
<br />
was right.  In that respect, I salute him.  However, my opinions of
<br />
his are a bit less flattering, but this is neither the time or the
<br />
place for such grandstanding.
<br />

<br />
I leave you with these words to consider.
<br />

<br />
If you have the BAM page censored, the Bookshire page could be next.
<br />
If you have the KKK banned, the EFF could just as easily be next.
<br />
If you have the Satanists banned, Jews could be next.
<br />
If you have the Republicans banned, Democrats could be next.
<br />

<br />
The splashing of water against cliffs causes houses to fall into the sea, 
<br />
as do small drops of censorship on part of the Constitution of the USA.
<br />
Think about that before you tell someone that something should be
<br />
removed because it offends you.  Censor one group, and you start you
<br />
censor the rest.
<br />

<br />
Reply to me, not the list.
<br />

<br />
Joe.
