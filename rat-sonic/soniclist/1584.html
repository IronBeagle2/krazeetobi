<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here are my comments on Sonic 29, FWIW:
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll let somebody else summarize all the plot and credit details...
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Spoiler alert:
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, I see they know how to give green eyes to _somebody_ (namely, Dulcy).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now if only they'd get Bunnie's right...
</em><br />

<br />
Not to mention the lower half of her body. As they brought in Dulcy *as is*
<br />
from the show for which I'm forever grateful, and the Archie people saw fit
<br />
to change  their first two attempts at Sally to the one we all know and love
<br />
from the show, why do these guys have such a sticking point on Bunnie with
<br />
robotisizing her waist and that cute little bunny behind of hers? (I mean,
<br />
they're even going to be bringing Uncle Chuck in as we know him to look like
<br />
from the show) Well, I can't complain *too* much. At least she's been a
<br />
pretty full time character for the last few issues, instead of just a
<br />
background bunny, if she was to be put in the story at all as she hasn't been
<br />
for awhile. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And isn't it convenient that the portable de-roboticizer would have only
</em><br />
_one_ charge left (and of course I assume they can't figure out how to 
<br />
recharge it or anything...)
<br />

<br />
Not to mention the fact that even with all of Rotor's technical skill, along
<br />
with Sally and Tails' computer savy, they didn't first de-robotisize Uncle
<br />
Chuck or Bunnie or both, (couldn't they have just stood together under the
<br />
ray?) and then taken the thing apart to see what exactly made it tick so that
<br />
they could have built more of the little godsends to have in reserve before
<br />
attempting something so risky as what Sally did, and ended up losing the
<br />
de-robotisizor in the first place, ending up back at square one. I know they
<br />
needed a plot, but as I always look for the logic, this one had a few holes
<br />
to deal with (I also find it a little too convienient that 1) A derobotisizor
<br />
would pop up at all. Why would Robotnik need such a thing? Time off for good
<br />
behavior for one of the robotisized animals (cheap shot, and a sick joke I
<br />
know. Sorry.)? 2) That a Robotisizor would be a large, telephone booth sized
<br />
contraption that would probably weigh a couple of tons, yet the derobotisizor
<br />
is this little hand held gizmo that Ducly could stuff in her pouch, or Sonic
<br />
in his backpack with ease. A bit of a reach to make that plot work, no?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll let somebody else comment on how Antoine was holding Bunnie...
</em><br />

<br />
Agreed.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Why should Sally have volunteered to be roboticized when Uncle Chuck's 
</em><br />
already there?  Or was this story set before he had regained his will? 
<br />
(Maybe the next issue will clarify this - Uncle Chuck's on the cover...)  
<br />
While I appreciate the comic's move towards the Sat. AM Sonic, I wish they'd 
<br />
note how it fits into the continuity, sort of like the Gargoyles comic is 
<br />
doing (or at least _was_ doing) with respect to the daily show.
<br />

<br />
I wish they would as well. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I don't know whether to be glad or disappointed at them not showing Sally's
</em><br />
roboticization - by not doing so, they spare us a possibly horrific sequence;
<br />
but OTOH this might have given the story even more drama...  
<br />

<br />
Very true. As disappointed as I was with the plot holes I mentioned, it *was*
<br />
a good story, and it would have been more dramatic (as I like a story to be)
<br />
with seeing Sally robotisized. All I know is when I saw that cover pic, I got
<br />
one hell of a feeling of horror. &lt;shiver!&gt; That cover was one creepy piece of
<br />
fantastic art!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And of course
</em><br />
the widget that was supposed to preserve her free will &quot;fell off&quot; during the 
<br />
process - again, how convenient.  Why didn't Rotor clip it to her or 
<br />
something?  (Or even stick it _in_ her ear?)
<br />

<br />
Here's another surpising thing. From what we know, you can't robotisize
<br />
something that's already robotisized. Ie: You can't turn something from flesh
<br />
to metal, if it's already metal. Now. With this in mind, once that
<br />
Robotisizor ray hit Sally, why didn't  the &quot;Free will&quot; disc blow up? If the
<br />
writers forgot this, a good thing that the disc fell off, no? The explosion
<br />
wouldn't have been all that great, but even so.... &lt;especially if Rote had
<br />
put it in a better place. Surprising that Sal herself didn't think of this
<br />
potential risk when she volunteered for this mission, considering what she
<br />
did to sabotage Robotnik as we saw in her mini series&gt;(if I'm missing
<br />
something for which the FW disc wouldn't have blown up for some logical
<br />
reason, then in her ear would indeed have been a good place to put it. ) I'm
<br />
also surprised that since the disk, should have blown up, Sally and Rote
<br />
didn't consider the plan a bust before trying it, as there would have been no
<br />
way for that Disc to give Sally back her will....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Odd that the process preserved all of Sally's coloring...
</em><br />

<br />
Indeed, while Bunnie just gets a cold steel gray, while she isn't even a grey
<br />
hare! (Insert rim shot wav..)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And while they at least showed _some_ struggle on Sally's part to obey 
</em><br />
Robotnik while roboticized, given her intense feelings for the Freedom 
<br />
Fighters (and presumably Sonic), I'd've thought she'd've struggled a bit 
<br />
harder and longer (maybe we can blame it on the shock of being 
<br />
roboticized)...
<br />

<br />
Well in &quot;Ultra Sonic&quot; it took a power ring for Uncle Chuck to come out of his
<br />
&quot;programming&quot; the first time, and he has feelings just as intense for the FF.
<br />
I thinnk Sally did okay that she had any free will left at all!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the art by Mawhinney and Koslowski was excellent as usual...
</em><br />

<br />
I wonder what Spaza would have done with it though......... (I wasn't at all
<br />
disappointed in the art though. Loved it in fact!)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The fan art isn't too shabby this time out (fanboys check out Sally's 
</em><br />
outfit); but I wouldn't think Bunnie and Sally are into tattoos and pierced 
<br />
ears, 
<br />

<br />
Nor  I . Fans have some *pretty strange* concepts of the FF for them to be
<br />
drawing this stuff. Still, there are those alt worlds along the cosmic
<br />
interstate that they could be drawing these sketches from....... &quot;Biker Babes
<br />
from Mobius!&quot; &lt;G&gt; (Forgive me, Girls!)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Bunnie's _left_ arm is the robot one, not her right...
</em><br />

<br />
Exactly.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now onto the Tails story:
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That was a rather lame escape by Tails: using fur from his tails to clog up
</em><br />
the roboticizer???  They didn't look too threadbare after he got out, and I
<br />
would think anything that could handle a whole two-tailed fox could handle 
<br />
whatever loose fur he could shake off...
<br />

<br />
As far as Tails' tails not looking too threadbare, perhaps he's a really good
<br />
shedder? ;) Seriously though, it was a lame escape, unless he was somehow
<br />
able to throw that extra fur from his Tails into a vent where it *did* clog
<br />
up the air system for the machine. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I also find it hard to believe Tails' tails are strong enough for him to 
</em><br />
pull out a mechanical tree by the roots and swing it like a golf club (but 
<br />
it was still amusing :^)).
<br />

<br />
Agreed. And yet, as David Bruce Banner demonstrated to the world for years
<br />
and years, (The Incredible Hulk to all you who've never picked it up) there's
<br />
no telling what one is capable of, in a fitted pique of emotion, particularly
<br />
*anger*.....
<br />
(Wonder how many FF Tails could fly out of danger in one shot if he really
<br />
needed to? He could be as good as Dulcy! )
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That bit about &quot;robbing me of my _innocence_&quot; was a bit much - at the risk
</em><br />
of getting a bit crude, just how realistic _was_ that Fiona automaton?  
<br />

<br />
Not to mention that with that explanation in mind, this is still a children's
<br />
book by all accounts....;)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(And 
</em><br />
note that the letter column for this issue has a quasi-explanation for Tails 
<br />
being 10 not 5, but 10 is still a bit young for this sort of thing, isn't it?
<br />
Or do Mobians hit puberty quicker than we do?)  And again, Tails' comment 
<br />
about &quot;my lost youth&quot; was a bit overdramatic; while it may be true, I doubt 
<br />
most people recognize the loss of their youth *when it happens* - I'd say it
<br />
takes years for it to sink in (and for us toon fans, maybe it never does
<br />
:^)).
<br />

<br />
I agree wholeheartedly. The explanation about Tails' age was quite lame
<br />
(sounded like D.C.'s attempt at merging all the multi universes). If they're
<br />
going to be basing the comic from here on in on the Sat A.M. series, why
<br />
don't they just *do* it, (Lose that crabmeat character) start over from the
<br />
ish where Sally from the show first appeared (Ish #16 I think, while still
<br />
keeping important issues like &quot;This island Hedgehog&quot; in the continuity.) and
<br />
say that Tails is ten years old through nothing else but the natural action
<br />
of ol father time (and the timekeeper with his timestones of course. &lt;G&gt;) The
<br />
&quot;Lost innocence&quot; and &quot;lost youth&quot; bit, was quite out of character for Tails.
<br />
He's only Ten, and he's talking more dramatically than Sally was in her
<br />
miniseries! Come on people! Match age to appropriate dialogue, would ya?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And another cliche: the nearly-instantly-rusting-out-when-wet-robot; I
</em><br />
could've believed a short-circuit, but not rust.  And I don't know whether 
<br />
to applaud Fiona's final tear as a nice touch, or sneer at it as yet another 
<br />
predictable cliche...
<br />

<br />
Indeed. I really found the whole part of Tails' reaction to Fiona's betrayal
<br />
to be the worst part of this story, and I *really* wish that they hadn't done
<br />
the story this way, or at least they could have chosen it as a story on it's
<br />
own that I could have convieniently and gratefully forgotten about, instead
<br />
of having it lead into the miniseries, which I'm really looking forward to.
<br />
If this story was just one of those not so great short one-shot stories that
<br />
seem to come about every so often, then I would have been okay with it, but
<br />
now it's a part of the larger continuity........*sigh*. 
<br />
I mean, Tails was with this robot girl for one day or so we can assume,  and
<br />
already he's so in love with her, that he outright denies the fact that she's
<br />
a robot? She's trying to kill him, and he keeps coming back with &quot;Don't do it
<br />
Fiona! You love me!&quot;? GAG! Spare me! And then the whole &quot;I'll make him fix
<br />
you and then we'll be together again.&quot; Oh please! (First off, if she's simply
<br />
rusted, why don't you just get some of that oil from your crankcase that you
<br />
&lt;*snicker*&gt; filled up from that oiled seagull? (I know from videos of the
<br />
Alaskan oil spill that those birds get a lot of oil in their feathers, but
<br />
not enough to fill a crankcase for a sub!)) 
<br />
And second of all, *hel-o-hoooo!* Tails? Anybody home? I've heard of a girl
<br />
stealing your heart and mind, and even your common sense and logic, but this
<br />
is rediculous! Are you so desperate for companionship that you deny that this
<br />
girl is not a flesh and blood being? Yes this does bring up arguments of how
<br />
a robot could perhaps grow to full or near sentience, (The Vision from &quot;The
<br />
Avengers&quot;, who was married after all to a mutant ie: The Scarlet
<br />
Witch,....Then there's Data from ST:TNG, who did pretty good in his personal
<br />
growth before getting his full range of emotions in &quot;Generations&quot; with that
<br />
chip...and of course, most recently there's EVE....), and how a person could
<br />
grow to love a being that isn't flesh and blood, but I really don't think
<br />
that Fiona has had any time (considering her behavior) to evolve any, like
<br />
the other mechanical being's I've listed. After all, there's no guarantee
<br />
that she would anyway, unless Robotnik had incorporated some of the &quot;self
<br />
awareness and adaptability programs from his EVE schematics into Fiona and
<br />
the other robots he created.......hmmm.....I'm suddenly beginning to be
<br />
reminded of &quot;Batman:The Animated Series&quot; with the ep: &quot;His silicon soul...&quot;
<br />
Batman (To Alfred about his robotic duplicate) : &quot;Could it have had a soul
<br />
alfred? A soul of silicon, but a *soul* nonetheless?&quot;
<br />
Still, even with this possibility, as I've said, I don't think with Fiona's
<br />
behavior, at the moment, this possibility took place. (I'm kinda marveling
<br />
here how I suddenly switched positions from flaming a story that made no
<br />
sense and was dumb, to musing about a story, if they had explained it a bit
<br />
more, would've had some good posibilities......)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Finally, with the part with the tear in Fiona's eye at the end, some may
</em><br />
think it cliche, some may think it touching, but considering that Fiona
<br />
showed *no* repeat, *NO* remorse or hesitancy about trying to robotisize or
<br />
strangle, or drown our favorite young fox, the only thing that I can think
<br />
of, is that her sheded tear was for the fact that she failed in her mission
<br />
to Robotnik to destroy the young &quot;mongrel&quot; (as Robotnik put it.) I'll admit
<br />
that I *did* like the scenes of Tails being in love with Fiona (strange
<br />
though that as a protector of the environment, Tails would do an act of
<br />
vandalism like carving his and Fiona's initials on a living tree.....), but
<br />
unless we see *some* evidence of Fiona developing a soul as I've mentioned, I
<br />
hope that this is last we see of Fiona, and that Tails in the meantime, can
<br />
find another love on his own in the miniseries with one of the Freedom
<br />
fighters &quot;down under&quot;.  With Fiona coming back and joining the FF as some of
<br />
the other posters to this list have said, well, it would be nice, but only if
<br />
they have it make sense. Maybe you could pass these comments on down to the
<br />
editor, Paul old pal?
<br />

<br />
One last note on this story that I have just *got* to say, is thus: Did this
<br />
this whole story remind *anyone else* besides me (through overdramatics and
<br />
stupidity (at certain points) to the point of it being comedy) of the Bugs
<br />
Bunny Cartoon where Bugs gets lured to the lair of an Evil Scientist by a
<br />
cute little robotic bunny that he finds to be as such later on. Then, when
<br />
the ES (Hmmm...Eric Shwartz? &lt;G&gt;) and the monster (Rudolph) are defeated,
<br />
Bugs says in overdramatic fashion....
<br />
Bugs: &quot;And soooo, having re-*re* disposed of the monster......&quot; 
<br />
(At this point, another mechanical Bunny babe (the first one was destroyed
<br />
earlier in the short) goes walking by and gives him a comes hither look....) 
<br />
Bugs (to audience, giving them a confident and calmly knowing look as he
<br />
hooks a thumb over toward the babe): It's mechanical. 
<br />
(Bunnybabe give Bugs a smooch on the cheek at this point, dazing Bugs before
<br />
walking off camera) 
<br />
Bugs: (regaining himself and speaking to audience in a near frenzy of
<br />
emotion) SO?!!...&lt;shrug&gt; IT'S MECHANICAL!!! (With this, Bugs starts off in
<br />
earnest, walking in lovesick robot fashion toward bunnybabe off camera). I
<br />
can't help laughing at the similarity. Well, here's hoping that &quot;notes from
<br />
the net&quot; starts up again so I can put at least some of my critiques to good
<br />
use....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But the art by Manak and Harvo was fairly good; Tails really did look 
</em><br />
half-dead when Fiona was about to dunk him for the third time (although he 
<br />
seemed to make a typical toonish quick recovery from it :^)).
<br />

<br />
Agreed. They couldn't have showed him crawling up onto shore? When Tails had
<br />
gotten whipped by Sonic in the last issue, he didn't get up again as soon as
<br />
he hit the floor....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  I hope they 
</em><br />
do as good a job in the Tails miniseries...
<br />

<br />
Personally, I hope they do a better job. If its as good as or better than
<br />
Princess Sally's first mini series (from &quot;In your face&quot; and the three
<br />
previous connecting stories from the back issues before it) with the emotions
<br />
it drew out, I'll be a writing some praises in the mail once more...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tidbits from the letters page: I'll let Dan Drazen flame the continuing 
</em><br />
office humor; Dylan is revealed to be a porcupine (then why didn't they name 
<br />
him Patrick or Percy or something?); 
<br />

<br />
What's wrong with Dylan?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Antoine is said to be 18 (then isn't 
</em><br />
Sally a bit young for him?  But he sure doesn't _act_ 18...); 
<br />

<br />
In the show, Ant is the same age as everyone else. Why would they say he's 18
<br />
here? They lost me on this one.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and Boomer was 
</em><br />
a former nickname for Rotor supposedly because of his voice (O-kayyyy...).
<br />

<br />
::Echo::
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I suppose all the above seems a bit harsh; I'll confess I've been in a bit
</em><br />
of a bad mood this weekend due to various things (not having a life being 
<br />
part of them), but I still think the observations above are valid. 
<br />

<br />
I know that my own comments were a bit harsh in some places, but I'll make no
<br />
claim to being in a bad mood. If I see holes, I'm gonna point em out. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also, 
</em><br />
I'd rather have flawed stories like the above that at least try to live up 
<br />
to the Sat. AM Sonic, then the lame ones of the earlier days that weren't
<br />
much better than the daily shows.
<br />

<br />
Agreed. Something that's good though flawed in spots, is better than not
<br />
having something good at all....(an ironic comment if you think about it,
<br />
