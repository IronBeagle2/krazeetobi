Arggh! Those horrible Telkom (The South African Phone monopoly) chaps
<br />
disconnected my phone! .. Anyways.. for now I'm back.. on the DAD170C's
<br />
telephonic communications unit, while he is compressing and analysing todays
<br />
input - a process called dreaming.
<br />

<br />
Okay first off, They put *both* the cartoon types into Zulu, for S.A.   So,
<br />
add Zulu as another DUBB. (The TV service however, didn't simulcast the
<br />
Saturday version in english.)
<br />

<br />
How nice, they dubbed it into Zulu.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't speak Zulu.
<br />

<br />
Okay, now what else?   Sonic being phased out?    Hmm.. I doubt it, rather
<br />
our blue pal seems to be be plaining out. So to speak, SEGA are probably
<br />
just letting Sonic fade and become the equiv of the nintendo 'Ninja 37' (or
<br />
whatever number it did get up to) 
<br />

<br />
The micro-machine advert? Nope, I live in Africa.. the place of the stupidly
<br />
high phone rates, wasted TV, and.. Oh, I did see some elephants. :P
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now.. On to some original material..     My good pal Ice-Blade, took me to
<br />
meet some guy he knows who owns a comic store. Well, he was a really nice
<br />
english chap, but that really has no relevance.. anyways.. Jeff managed to
<br />
get me one of the Sonic comics from Archie.. (No #18) Okay, so it was the
<br />
January edition.. but what the hell.. who can really complain, poor Jeff
<br />
only has half a brain.. Dough.. off topic again.
<br />

<br />
Anyways.. the first story .. well.. sucked. Okay, let me be fair.. From my
<br />
perspective it sucked.. There were a few pretty good humour pieces though..
<br />
Well, I guess that it was a matter of taste.
<br />

<br />
Darn.. I'm wondering off again.. [Coffie Sabotage I tell you!] But, I looked
<br />
at the art, some of the pictures are sadly wasted... I have attributed these
<br />
to when facial expression occurs.  Okay.. looking again, the Manak dude
<br />
draws them screaming nicely.. but when they smile.. AGH.. They get that
<br />
&quot;Casper the friendly ghost&quot; type look. :( 
<br />

<br />
The 2nd story, pencilled by Art Mawhinney, was actually pretty danged
<br />
impressive.. 
<br />

<br />
But just wait a moment. #2 could have had a slightly deeper stoyline..
<br />
&quot;Ceremonial Acorn?&quot; Why not some sort of crazy key, or thingemabob?  Okay, I
<br />
mean sure, Sal's last name is Acorn.. but.. um.. well..   Well.. you kinda
<br />
get the idea... 
<br />

<br />
Oh well, I have now decided that i will make a Digital Comic Format in 1997,
<br />
and start my own comic (Freeware.. of course) Perhaps I might change my mind
<br />
later dis year.. but we'll see-see.
<br />

<br />
Oh yes, just to drop a cow of though quick, &lt;Cow Launched! :P&gt;  Twisted
<br />
Mettle is coming on.. No, the Uzi-team of Sega hasn't visited me yet.. :P
<br />
And, I haven't quit either.. Actually, just 1/2 an hour ago, I was working
<br />
on 'Something wonderfull&quot; for it..   Hmm... I'll see about making a nifty
<br />
little demo for you chaps sometime.. :) I already have a sorta-working
<br />
system, but it suffers some.. well.. instabilities. 
<br />

<br />
Anyways.. Jeff will be acquiring some more comics for me.. I'll haveta
<br />
compliment the Art Mawhinney chap.. his drawing style has been processed and
<br />
uploaded to OrganicRAM for later usage. Or in simpler terms, &quot;Me Simon, look
<br />
conic, draw like comic.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Cheerio! And never forget.. &quot;Cows are the root of all comedy.&quot;
<br />
