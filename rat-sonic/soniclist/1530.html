&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 5
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just before dawn when Sally was roused from a
<br />
dreamless sleep by a knock at the cabin door.  &quot;Who is it?&quot; she
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get your cloak, Princess.&quot;  It was Julayla.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally got out of bed, felt around the side of her bed for
<br />
her boots, slowly pulled them on, then walked across the hut to a
<br />
wardrobe.  Fumbling through, she found the heavy hooded cloak
<br />
that belonged to her.  She draped it over her shoulders gladly,
<br />
for the morning was cold.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whuh the hoo-ha's goin' on, Sally?&quot; Bunnie asked in a
<br />
sleepy slur of words.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Julayla wants me for something.  I wonder what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Homsanomuh,&quot; Bunnie mumbled as she drifted back to sleep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stepped out of the hut, slowly closing the door behind
<br />
her.  Julayla was already dressed in a long cloak of her own. 
<br />
Without a word, she began walking to the edge of the clearing, with
<br />
Sally following close behind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinarily, Sally wouldn't have hesitated to ask Julayla a
<br />
hundred questions: Why get up so early?  Where were they going? 
<br />
Did she bring provisions?  But there was something about
<br />
Julayla's demeanor that morning which forbade questioning --
<br />
which forbade conversation altogether.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two walked on for several hours.  Breakfast was taken on
<br />
the run, as Julayla and Sally ate berries and other edibles they
<br />
found along the way.  This was nothing new to Sally, for Julayla
<br />
had taught her survival skills already.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, after several hours, they had circled back to a
<br />
large meadow about ten minutes walk from Knothole.  Julayla sat
<br />
down on a fallen tree trunk, and Sally sat down next to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is this place?&quot; Julayla asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Sally began, not really sure just what Julayla was
<br />
asking, &quot;it's a meadow.  We usually come here to play Capture the
<br />
Flag.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess because it's so open.  See, if the flag were placed
<br />
at that small sapling there, or over by that stone, you'd have a
<br />
hard time getting to it without being seen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess, when you play this game, what is it you're
<br />
after?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We try to capture the flag that's held by the other team.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, Princess; what is it you're REALLY after?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't understand.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julayla said nothing.  She leaned back slightly and studied
<br />
a few small clouds overhead in the sky.  Sally looked too, not
<br />
knowing what she was looking at.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There,&quot; Julayla said at length.  &quot;That cloud toward the
<br />
northern horizon.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you see the face in it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I don't.  Whose face do you mean?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You never met him,&quot; Julayla said as she turned to look at
<br />
Sally.  &quot;More years ago than I care to recount, when I was only a
<br />
little older than you are now and living in our village far to
<br />
the East, I loved a boy.  Juleric, his name was.  He never sought
<br />
my heart, but I gave mine to him gladly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally listened in rapt attention.  The thought of Julayla as
<br />
a young girl in love was one she'd never entertained before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He could have claimed the heart of any girl in the village.
<br />
When he chose another, it was devastating.  Yet I knew that I
<br />
would always love him, and that I would still see his face even
<br />
when he was gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You saw his face in the cloud, then?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  But only because I carry his face with me.  In my
<br />
heart.&quot;  The two were silent for a short time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess Sally, you miss your home.  I think we all
<br />
do.  And yet you still have that home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I do?  Where?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julayla didn't answer the question.  She just looked at
<br />
Sally and waited for the Princess to answer her own question.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Julayla, what good is a memory?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That I cannot answer.  You yourself will discover the
<br />
answer.  When it is time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Time for what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Julayla didn't answer.  Instead, she rose to her feet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You must remember.  Remember everything and anything.  You
<br />
said you were worried because you could not remember your old
<br />
room, even its color.  Then remember the shape of the door or
<br />
window.  Remember the sounds you heard every day in that room. 
<br />
It will return.  And once it returns, you will understand what a
<br />
memory is good for.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That is your assignment: to stay here and remember.  Come
<br />
back to Knothole when you are finished, whenever that may be.&quot;  And
<br />
without another word, Julayla walked away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is ridiculous!&quot; Sally thought.  &quot;There's no way this
<br />
can help me!  Why should I even bother?&quot;  Indeed, she spent the
<br />
first 20 minutes or so studiously and angrily avoiding her
<br />
&quot;assignment.&quot;  She circled the meadow, looked at the clouds in
<br />
the sky, tried and failed to count the number of trees
<br />
surrounding the meadow, then finally as the sun climbed to its
<br />
midday height she sat at the foot of the willow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is stupid!&quot; she said out loud.  &quot;Remember this! 
<br />
Remember that!  It's all a bunch of...&quot;  She was so disgusted she
<br />
was at a loss for words, but she finally came up with a phrase:
<br />
&quot;It's all a bunch of...of moonshine on water!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gasped.  Her eyes went wide.  She hadn't heard those
<br />
words spoken since...since she was a girl.  She had said them
<br />
while watching the delicate willow branches as they swayed in the
<br />
breeze, branches as fine as...as hair!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly it all flooded over her.  She was young again; she
<br />
must have been only three.  She was seated on someone's lap,
<br />
looking at her own reflection in a mirror as that someone brushed
<br />
Sally's hair after her bath.  That someone was singing a song, a
<br />
lullaby, about night and the moonshine on water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Sally was remembering.  She remembered that she was in
<br />
the nursery, only now she could see it all.  She saw everything
<br />
with absolute clarity and conviction.  She remembered every
<br />
sound, every scent, every color.  But most of all, she remembered
<br />
how good it felt at that very moment, to sit without a stitch of
<br />
clothing on someone's lap watching yourself in a mirror having
<br />
your hair brushed by someone singing a simple song.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally's reaction was simple and straightforward: for the next
<br />
forty minutes, on and off, she cried her eyes out.  The memory had
<br />
created a joy in her she had not felt in a long time; the
<br />
realization that that joy was now lost to her was too much to bear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, worn out from crying, she looked across the meadow
<br />
from beneath the tree.  &quot;Anything and everything,&quot; Julayla had
<br />
said.  What else was there?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she looked at the meadow itself.  It was familiar, but
<br />
in a way Sally couldn't describe.  It looked like...like the
<br />
palace garden in Mobotropolis!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this what Julayla was driving at?  Had she chosen this
<br />
meadow because it was a good game field, or because of the memory
<br />
it evoked, a memory unidentified until now?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was getting to be too much.  Sally quickly walked away
<br />
from the willow and stepped into the Great Forest.  She took one
<br />
quick look back over her shoulder at the willow, then turned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now she saw something that almost stopped her heart. 
<br />
She looked up at the trunks and branches of the trees as they
<br />
interlaced to form the protective shield that kept Knothole
<br />
hidden.  Only now it looked less and less like a covering of tree
<br />
branches and more and more like a ceiling.  The ceiling of the
<br />
Throne Room at the Palace.  And before her she thought she could
<br />
see an aged tree trunk shift into the ornate throne of the Acorn
<br />
kings.  And seated on the throne....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Daddy?&quot; she heard herself say in a half-whisper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong, my dear?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Daddy, I...I don't know what's happening to me.  And I'm
<br />
scared.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know.  I wish I could calm your fear but it's not within my
<br />
power.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What IS happening to me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're growing up, my dear.  I only wish I really WAS here
<br />
to see it.&quot;  And he smiled THAT smile, the one he gave when there
<br />
was a joke that only two could share.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But I'm not ready yet!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know.  But there's nobody to assume the throne as Regent
<br />
until you come of age, and you no longer have the luxury of
<br />
waiting.  Whether you're ready or not, whether you like it or not,
<br />
this old throne is yours.  If you're ready to take it back.  THAT
<br />
is the point, Sally.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sally awoke, it was with eyes red and swollen from crying.
<br />
She was at the base of an old tree stump, its wood long rotted with
<br />
decay.  She looked around.  The light was failing.  The sun was
<br />
low in the sky; almost night!  How long had she been asleep?  She
<br />
gathered her cloak about her and began running back toward
<br />
Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the emotions that had overwhelmed her that day,
<br />
Sally felt no fatigue.  In fact, remembering what she had gone
<br />
through buoyed her up as nothing had before.  She had to tell
<br />
someone!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran into the center of Knothole.  There appeared to be
<br />
no activity of any kind.  She quickly walked to the cabin she
<br />
shared with Bunnie.  &quot;Bunnie?&quot; she called out as she opened the
<br />
door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner had Sally entered the hut than the door slammed
<br />
shut behind her.  Sally turned, and could see Bunnie in the dim
<br />
light.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, I've got to tell you what....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before she could say anything else, Bunnie placed her
<br />
hand across Sally's mouth as if to silence her.  Sally simply
<br />
batted it away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, what's your problem?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails is missing, THAT'S mah problem!&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 6
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sally's eyes became adjusted to the dark, she could see
<br />
that Sonic, Rotor and Antoine were in the room with them.  It was
<br />
a major infraction for ANY of the boys to be in the girls' hut
<br />
after curfew, but that fact seemed to pale in comparison to
<br />
Bunnie's news.  &quot;When did it happen?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't know.  Last anyone saw of Tails, he was sittin'
<br />
next to Sonic at dinner.  He left the table and never came back. 
<br />
Whenever Rosie or Julayla asked about him we told them that he
<br />
was with someone else who wasn't there at the time--Sonic or Rotor
<br />
or someone.  I think we managed to fool them through bedcheck,
<br />
but we still don't know what happened to the little darlin'!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I even took a quick dip in the river,&quot; Rotor added.  &quot;At
<br />
least we know he didn't fall in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, did you say anything to Tails that might have gotten
<br />
him mad or...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No way, Sal!  I was just, you know, talking to him.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What did you say, exactly?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not much, just the usual, like how I was getting tired of
<br />
the same old thing over and over for meals and how much I missed
<br />
Uncle Chuck's chili dogs and...oh boy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonique, what is meaning this 'oh boy'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well....&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, what are you trying to say?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's probably nothing, Sal, but...well, last night I was
<br />
talking to him about Uncle Chuck's chili dogs and how he used to
<br />
make 'em and....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, please!  I don't want to hear any more about chili
<br />
dogs!  Besides, it's not like Tails knows the way to Uncle
<br />
Chuck's.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well....&quot;  And so Sonic told the others of their conversation the
<br />
night before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you didn't!  Why would you tell Tails where Uncle
<br />
Chuck's house used to be?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How'd I know he'd go looking for it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's four years old!!  Four-year-olds do things like that! 
<br />
Smart move, Sonic!  He's probably lost somewhere in the Great
<br />
Forest right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He is not.  I....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's more?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...sort of kind of drew him a map.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And he's got it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't find it anywhere; he MUST have taken it with him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perfect!  You gave him directions to get to Robotnik!  And
<br />
if Tails get caught by any SWATbots, they'll have directions to
<br />
get to us!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax!  I'll just go get him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you can't just go walking back to Robotropolis
<br />
and....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who says I can't?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It looked like the two of them were two seconds away from a
<br />
fight.  That would REALLY have brought out the grown-ups. 
<br />
Instead, Sally lowered her voice.  But while she spoke calmly,
<br />
she continued to look Sonic in the eye.  &quot;What is it, really?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...&quot; Sonic hesitated.  &quot;Well, it's just that I promised
<br />
Rosie that I'd look after Tails all day today.  And...and I
<br />
promised her I wouldn't let her down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, Sal, we both know the grown-ups think I'm a loser,
<br />
some kind of screw-up.  Just 'cause I don't do well in school or
<br />
I don't help out as much as they say I'm supposed to.  I WANTED
<br />
to show them I was good at SOMETHING, but....&quot;  Sonic turned away
<br />
from her and the rest of the children.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's OK,&quot; Sally said in a whisper, placing her hand on his
<br />
shoulder.  &quot;We'll look for him together.  All of us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, you weren't even here when....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That doesn't make any difference, Sonic.  I don't want to
<br />
see anything happen to him, either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Princess,&quot; Antoine asked with a tremor in his voice,
<br />
&quot;for the all of us to be going to that terrible place....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine.  We'll only take volunteers, then.  All those who
<br />
care about Tails, raise your hand.  OK, it's unanimous.  Get your
<br />
cloaks--we're leaving.&quot;
