&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*sigh* Okay, folks, we have a problem here. Specifically, in David 
<br />
Gonterman's Sailor Moon: American Kitsune fanfic, part 6, David's Side.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ordinarily, I'd just e-mail to him about it, but considering the 
<br />
nature of the problem, I felt it would be best to e-mail to him, as well as
<br />
post to the mailing list as well as the Sonic and Sailor Moon 
<br />
newsgroups--the last due to it being a Sailor Moon fanfic, and the two 
<br />
former because Mr. Gonterman is well-known for his Sonic stories...also, 
<br />
as a comment about what *not* to do when trying to write a good fanfic...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very simply, Mr. Gonterman used that story as a platform to bash the 
<br />
people campaigning against the CDA (Which is the *Communications* Decency 
<br />
Act, BTW, not *Computer* as your story erroneously states) as well as the 
<br />
Blue Ribbon Campaign in particular, which is fighting for freedom of 
<br />
speech on the net. Judging from what was written, Mr. Gonterman has 
<br />
apparently done little or no research into the subject. But, at this 
<br />
point, that is irrelevant--I'd prefer to discuss the pros and cons of the 
<br />
CDA with him in a private forum.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What *is* the problem, however, is using what up until then was a 
<br />
decent, if somewhat sub-par writing-wise, story as a soapbox to bash a 
<br />
group that you politically disagree with. Bashing people you know, like 
<br />
that group of AOLers that you had argued with, is tolerable, but bashing 
<br />
an entire group you've had no contact with at all is something else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A simple, polite suggestion to you, Mr. Gonterman...please edit that 
<br />
story to get rid of the political references, or at the very least, mark 
<br />
it on your site as politically-oriented as you did the other story that 
<br />
put forth your views on the CDA and as you keep refering to it, 'smut' on 
<br />
the net. Also, please at least take the time to look up the ACLU site, 
<br />
and read the information on just what the CDA is doing, as compared to 
<br />
what the media claims it was supposed to do.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along with the above, I give a caution to anyone else who might be 
<br />
thinking of including politics in their fanfics...please don't. 
<br />
Otherwise, the flames will probably become fast and furious. And there a 
<br />
lot of people with lower tolerance threshholds than me.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that I've gotten the above out of the way, its my turn to get on 
<br />
the soapbox, and point out something the pro-CDA people may have 
<br />
overlooked--something that hits *very* close to home to both fandoms 
<br />
represented here.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Fred (StH and Sailor Moon fan): It's time to watch Sailor Moon!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(changes the channel..watches a bit)
<br />
Fred: Waugh! Barney?!? What happened to Sailor Moon???
<br />

<br />
Me (looking over Fred's shoulder): Didn't you know? DIC was given a court 
<br />
order to re-edit Sailor Moon, or face prosecution under the CDA due to 
<br />
the 'indecent' scenes involving nudity. DIC couldn't afford the edit, so 
<br />
they just pulled the show entirely.
<br />

<br />
Fred: *sigh* Oh well. Okay, let's turn over to USA--Sonic the Hedgehog 
<br />
should be on--at this point, I'd even choke down the weekday episodes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(click)
<br />
Fred: AIEEEEE! More Barney! What happened???
<br />

<br />
Me: Oh, Sonic got pulled too--seems people started complaining about 
<br />
Sonic promoting terrorist activities, and such. The final killer, though, 
<br />
was another CDA violation--most of the characters were nude, or near 
<br />
enough to it to be indecent. I hear that Tom &amp; Jerry Kids is next on the 
<br />
chopping block.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Fred: But Barney never wears clothes...
<br />

<br />
Me: True, but he has an 'educational show', which Sonic and Sailor Moon 
<br />
aren't. So he stays, and the others get tossed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Fred: *whimper*
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about it, folks...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chris Forsyth
