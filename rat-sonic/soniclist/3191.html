<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How could fire ants chew through the wall in so short a time?  (hours?)  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This seemed a bit deus ex machina to me...
</em><br />

<br />
Not at all. Some ants can strip a forest bare of anything green that lies
<br />
in their path in a matter of hours; it's not unreasonable that they can
<br />
disassemble a wall in short order.  To make a computer analogy, ants work
<br />
like parallel processors; each one is fairly weak by itself, but because
<br />
there are so many of them working as a coordinated unit, they have a great
<br />
combined power.
<br />

<br />
I find it curious that a whole 1/3 page was devoted to the fire ants in
<br />
part one of &quot;A Sense of History&quot; in #34, and one ant made a cameo appearance
<br />
on a leaf in part two.  The ants' world, the Mobian soil, was ripped apart
<br />
when the Floating Island rose into the air; I'd expect now they have a vested
<br />
interest in seeing it, and their various ant colonies, re-united.  So I
<br />
wouldn't be surprised if they don't play a pivotal role in the Knuckles'
<br />
mini-series.  And then in part three, a very similar scene (p. 5) with
<br />
Mount Fate collapsing, and Edmund &amp; co. escaping (instead of the ants), just
<br />
has to make me wonder...
<br />

<br />
Another thing that struck my funny bone was Knuckles snapping his... 
<br />
knuckles?  I figure he must have fingers inside those mittens he wears,
<br />
like all the other echidnas we see.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also that with all that power, Dimitri could apparently be crushed to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; death by the collapse of the tower (and it wasn't clear that the skull-like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (shades of The Phantom?) Mt. Fate was created by its collapse).
</em><br />

<br />
That was clear enough to me.  But why would Mt. Fate be laughing at Knuckles
<br />
in the final panel of part 3?  Is somebody or something trapped within Mt.
<br />
Fate?  Is it Dimitri, biding his time for the chance to put an end to the
<br />
long line of Guardians of the Floating Island?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Either this means Mobius is a future Earth,[...] or it was influenced by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Earth culture/settlers, or [...]
</em><br />

<br />
My take on it is that Mobius is an alternate, present-day Earth.  Issues
<br />
raised by having a villain who despoils the planet, destroys forests and
<br />
wildlife, and enslaves the surviving population like robots (sounds like
<br />
some jobs I've had) in a technological dystopia, also apply to our world.
<br />
And then you have a small group of individuals, with Sonic at their helm,
<br />
who reject that future and who know they can change it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still think the decision to dismantle their technological society was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bit of an overreaction, but I'll accept it for the story's sake...
</em><br />

<br />
It shows that Echidna society were still masters of their own fate,
<br />
and they had the courage to correct a major mistake they realized
<br />
they had made.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At least the UPC symbol will only cover part of her boots this time...
</em><br />

<br />
Odd how some of the early issues didn't have the UPC barcode on the cover.
<br />
I'm glad my Sonic mini-series #3 doesn't have it -- that Scott Shaw! cover
<br />
has to be an all-time classic!
