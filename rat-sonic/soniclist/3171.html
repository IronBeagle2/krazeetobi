Dan,
<br />

<br />
Not wishing to get off-topic, but DESPITE the shoddy animation, which really
<br />
was the BEST on TV at that point in time, it's the STORIES which determine
<br />
whether legitimacy should be conferred or not. Many of those stories on the
<br />
TREK animated series do warrant inclusion into the continuity, especially
<br />
YESTERYEAR, MORE TROUBLES MORE TRIBBLES and THE COUNTER-CLOCK INCIDENT. It
<br />
would be like trying to dismiss a legitimate SONIC story on the basis that
<br />
there was one aspect you didn't like.
<br />

<br />
As for stuff &quot;ending up on the cutting room floor&quot;, as it were, you'd be
<br />
amazed at how many bits haven't been used in every story or changed because
<br />
of one reason or another. In fact, it's only recently that we're able to
<br />
develop the stories we can BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY ANIMATED SERIES to lead
<br />
the cart. I fully believe after working on the KNUCKLES mini-series recently
<br />
that if this were the situation when we did the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series,
<br />
at the very least the villain and the mission would have been allowed as
<br />
originally intended. I can't say more in case we can do that story in the
<br />
future.
<br />

<br />
BTW, I was wondering how come you hadn't commented on SONIC #36, good or bad,
<br />
just yet.
<br />

<br />
Ken
<br />
