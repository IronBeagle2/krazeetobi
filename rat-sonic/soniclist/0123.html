<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;based on characters created by Service and Games (SEGA) and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on characters created by Archie Comic Publications
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE:  Tails does not appear in this story because,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the way I wrote history, Tails had not joined
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the freedom fighters at this point.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night had settled over The Great Forest.  Most creatures were asleep 
<br />
and dreaming various dreams.  The inhabitants of Knothole Village were no 
<br />
exception.  Every freedom fighter was in bed sleeping peacefully, except for 
<br />
Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sitting in front of his computer, Bookshire sat back and groaned.  
<br />
For the last two months he had been trying every trick in the book and then 
<br />
some in order to access the Robotropolis Main Computer Core and he hadn't 
<br />
been having any luck whatsoever.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire looked at the computer screen and rubbed his eyes.  It 
<br />
was filled with complex mathematical calculations and at the bottom it said 
<br />
&quot;ACCESS DENIED&quot;.  Very early on in the project Bookshire had discovered that 
<br />
all outside links to the RMCC were protected by complicated data encryption 
<br />
algorithms.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is ridiculous,&quot; he said to no one in particular &quot;At this rate 
<br />
I'll never crack the access code.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat back and thought for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What I need is a direct terminal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, that meant actually going into Robotropolis and using one 
<br />
of the many workstations located throughout the city.  Cracking the entry 
<br />
code for one of the stations wouldn't be a problem, but getting caught would 
<br />
be, and, with his bad leg, he wouldn't get far if he was discovered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh well,&quot; he said as he turned off the computer &quot;maybe one day...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned out the lights and went to bed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The morning found the freedom fighters going about their business as 
<br />
usual.  Rotor was sitting at a table next to his hut with both a pitcher and 
<br />
a mug of hot chocolate and a small pile of papers that he was looking over.  
<br />
He looked up for a moment to take a sip from his mug when he saw Bookshire 
<br />
limping by with cane in hand looking rather depressed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Bookshire,&quot; called Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire looked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, hi Rotor,&quot; he said
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Would you like some hot chocolate?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; said Bookshire as he walked over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor poured another mug as Bookshire sat down opposite him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; said Rotor &quot;Is something bothering you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess you could say that,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;I've been working on 
<br />
trying to break into Robotnik's main computer for the last two months and I 
<br />
haven't been having any luck at all.  It wouldn't be so hard if I had access 
<br />
to a direct terminal, but the only ones are in Robotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;I can see how that would be a problem.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two sat in silence for a moment or two before Rotor spoke again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have an idea,&quot; he said &quot;why don't we send someone into 
<br />
Robotropolis to try to break in for you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I doubt it would work,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;so far as I know I'm the 
<br />
only one in the Village that can't even begin to try to decode Robotnik's 
<br />
computer network.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We wouldn't need a computer expert,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;wait here a 
<br />
moment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor went back into his hut and emerged a few minutes later 
<br />
carrying a small, flat box which he set down in front of Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Its a mini computer and long range communications set,&quot; said Rotor 
<br />
&quot;All we would have to do is have someone use the computer to tap into the 
<br />
mainframe while you give them directions through the comm. link from here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, that might just work,&quot; said Bookshire brightening up 
<br />
considerably &quot;why don't we go see what Sally thinks about it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two finished their hot chocolate and went over to Princess 
<br />
Sally's hut.  Sally liked the idea and, soon, Sonic and Sally were headed 
<br />
toward Robotropolis, while Rotor, Bookshire, and Bunnie sat down in front 
<br />
of Bookshire's computer and waited.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in Robotropolis, Robotnik was standing by a window, gazing out 
<br />
at the city when Snively entered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you trace it?&quot; asked Robotnik without turning.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...no, sir,&quot; replied Snively &quot;we traced the transmission to a 
<br />
relay station just north of here and then we lost it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I trust, Snively, that you are doing everything in your power to 
<br />
trace this transmission,&quot; said Robotnik, his temper rising &quot;I will not have 
<br />
rebel freedom fighters breaking into my system!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively just stood there unable to think of anything to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a moment, Robotnik calmed down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you send for Commander Packbell?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; replied Snively &quot;He should be arriving within the hour, 
<br />
sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Actually, I should be arriving now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively was grabbed from behind and tossed to one side and a cloaked 
<br />
figure entered the room.  Robotnik turned away from the window to face him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; he said &quot;Commander Packbell, and how is my 
<br />
favorite android today?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm your only android, sir,&quot; Packbell replied. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell, I have a new assignment for you,&quot; said Robotnik &quot;Someone 
<br />
on the outside has been trying to break into the computer system.  You're 
<br />
job is to track them down.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's it?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hum, somehow I expected something challenging from you, sir,&quot; said 
<br />
Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just do it!&quot; snapped Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well,&quot; answered Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to leave. As he walked toward the door he grabbed Snively, 
<br />
who was in his way again, and tossed him over his shoulder.        
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excuse me, please,&quot; said Packbell as he passed by.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another part of the city Sonic and Sally had managed to make it 
<br />
into an abandoned service crawl way.  After a few minutes, the two emerged 
<br />
into and empty room with a workstation in it.     
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sonic &quot;we're here.  So, what now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just stand and watch,&quot; said Sally.  She went over to the workstation 
<br />
and opened Rotor's computer. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stand and watch?!,&quot; said Sonic in disbelief &quot;I can't just stand!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Try to have some patience,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, patients are for hospitals.  We're in Robo-country, and that 
<br />
makes me edgy,&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed as she began to make the connection to Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, back in Knothole, Bookshire, Rotor, and Bunnie were still 
<br />
waiting for Sally's signal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me again,&quot; said Bunnie &quot;How is it that you can get into Robo's 
<br />
computer without being traced?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's rather simple really,&quot; explained Bookshire &quot;My computer has a 
<br />
random signal path generator.  Every time I send a signal to the system it 
<br />
gets routed though a completely random selection of relay stations and 
<br />
satilites throughout the planet.  Since the path keeps changing with each 
<br />
signal it's impossible to trace.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the speaker crackled to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knothole, this is Sally, over&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is Knothole,&quot; replied Bookshire &quot;we read you loud and clear.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've located a workstation and I've hooked your computer into it,&quot; 
<br />
reported Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Bookshire.    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire leaned forward and turned on his monitor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally,&quot; said Rotor &quot;on the computer is a button marked &quot;screen 
<br />
transmit&quot;, push it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Bookshire's monitor laid out a menu of options.  At the top 
<br />
of the screen it said:  ROBOTROPOLIS MAIN COMPUTER CORE ACCESS STATION 
<br />
#1245-B.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wonderful,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;now all we have to do is fine out what 
<br />
the code is for getting in from the outside.&quot;       
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sally &quot;I suggest that we start with system security.  
<br />
I'm logging in with Rotor's cryptosmasher software.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Getting in was surprisingly easy and, soon, they believed that they 
<br />
had found what they were looking for.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I have something,&quot; said Sally &quot;It's a code labeled 
<br />
'global access'.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;I see it.  I think that that's it.  Hang on 
<br />
one moment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire pulled out a blank optical disc and placed it into his 
<br />
optical recorder and hit the record button.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, Sally,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;transmit the file.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Transmitting...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen filled up with incomprehensible data all of which they 
<br />
now had on disc.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; said Rotor &quot;that should do it, so disconnect and come home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got it,&quot; said Sally &quot;we're on our way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Finally,&quot; said Sonic impatiently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, come on,&quot; said Sally as she disconnected the computer &quot;it wasn't 
<br />
that bad.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wasn't bad!  My legs fell asleep!&quot; exclaimed Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well wake them up,&quot; she said &quot;we've got to go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally tore out of Robotopolis as fast as they could.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived back at Knothole they immediately went down to 
<br />
Bookshire computer room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did it work?&quot; asked Sally as they entered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You bet it did,&quot; replied Bunnie &quot;that ol' genius has a direct link 
<br />
into the system.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; replied Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now we should be able to get any info on what ever we need,&quot; said 
<br />
Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor yawned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; he said &quot;I think that it should wait until morning.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others agreed and they left to go back to their huts.  Bookshire 
<br />
stayed at the terminal and looked through a few files.  Interesting, he 
<br />
thought to himself.  He turned off the computer and went to bed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean you lost it!&quot; exclaimed Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swat-bot turned from the computer to face him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The signal was traced to a relay station in the Great Swamp and 
<br />
then it was terminated,&quot; it reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell grumbled in suppressed anger.  He walked over to the wall 
<br />
where there was a rack of laser rifles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know I don't like failure,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quickly removing a rifle from its place, he turned and blasted the 
<br />
bot out of its seat.  Replacing the rifle, he walked over to the comm. panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bot Distribution, could you send me another Swat-bot.  The other 
<br />
one displeased me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Acknowledged,&quot; came the reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell turned towards the computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I swear, when I find the rebels that are doing this, they're going 
<br />
to be on their knees begging me to robotize them.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Bookshire was back again in front of the terminal, 
<br />
examining Robotnik's system.  At one point, he came across a directory 
<br />
labeled, &quot;CURRENT OFFENSIVE PROJECTS&quot;.  As he began to read through the 
<br />
terrible ideas that Robotnik was devising to eliminate the freedom fighters, 
<br />
he came across a recent entry that stated that an intense acid rain factory 
<br />
would be on-line in less than one day.  After reading enough of the entry, 
<br />
he leaped out of his chair and ran to warn the freedom fighters.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I knew that terminal would come in handy,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Bunnie, and Sonic were crouched near a junk heap on the 
<br />
outskirts of Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, what's the plan Sally girl?&quot; asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You and I are going to break into the control room and disable the 
<br />
security devices while Sonic plants the explosives to destroy the factory.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three freedom fighters made their way toward the factory.  They 
<br />
split up just outside the factory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good luck you two,&quot; said Sonic &quot; as he raced off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, Sally and Bunnie found it surprisingly easy to get 
<br />
inside the factory.  While carefully avoiding the security devices, the two 
<br />
made their way to the control room.  When they arrived, they were somewhat 
<br />
surprised to find that there weren't any bots manning it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's odd,&quot; Sally remarked as she began to look for the security 
<br />
override switches &quot;We shouldn't have gotten in here this easily.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think it's a trap?&quot; asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure,&quot; Sally replied.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I found the security switches,&quot; said Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Sally.  She examined the switches and panels.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; she said &quot;According to this display, there's more 
<br />
than one set of security overrides.  The two sets have to be deactivated at 
<br />
the same time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; said Bunnie &quot;Where's the other set?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's on the other side of the factory,&quot; Sally replied.  She handed 
<br />
Bunnie a comm. link &quot;Take this.  I'll go over to the other set and we'll 
<br />
shut them off at the same time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be waiting,&quot; said Bunnie &quot;Good luck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You too,&quot; said Sally as she walked out of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Bunnie examined the panels again.  She knew a 
<br />
bit about computers, not as much as Sally or Bookshire, but the knowledge 
<br />
she did have had been helpful in the rebellion.  As she began to look at 
<br />
one of the panels, the door to the room slammed shut. She turned in alarm as 
<br />
a previously unnoticed door slid open and a dozen Swat-bots came in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;FREEZE PRISONER,&quot; declared the leader.  Each bot had a laser rifle 
<br />
aimed directly at her.  Bunnie froze where she was, too startled by their 
<br />
sudden appearance to react in any other way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally made it to the extra set of overrides and turned on her 
<br />
comm. link.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, this is Sally, do you read,&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No answer,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie?&quot; she asked again, slightly alarmed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no answer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She ran back to the other room to find it completely abandoned.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A transport docked at the main prison block on the other side of 
<br />
Robotropolis.  A group of Swat-bots escorted their prisoner into a large 
<br />
meeting room where Commander Packbell was eagerly waiting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, well, well,&quot; he remarked as Bunnie was escorted in &quot;whom do 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we have here?&quot;       
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked up to her and glared. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, I may not have been able to trace that transmission, but 
<br />
the false info about the acid rain factory did the job equally well,&quot; he said 
<br />
&quot;Only a group of freedom fighters that had access to the system could have 
<br />
known it was there.  You shall be an example to the rest of the rebellion.  
<br />
I'll show all of them what can happen when they try to break into Robotnik's 
<br />
computer system.  First however, if you are willing to tell me about your 
<br />
friends and how they broke in, I might go easy on you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your dreams, commander,&quot; Bunnie replied.    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh well,&quot; said Packbell.  He signalled to the bots. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll see what some of my devices do to change your mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swat-bots escorted her from the room.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Bunnie was beginning to wish she hadn't come on this mission.  
<br />
Packbell had strapped her into a machine that delivers controlled bursts 
<br />
of intense electricity to the victim.  Bunnie was only half conscious and 
<br />
her breathing was short and shallow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Still not talking, huh,&quot; said Packbell &quot;Oh well.  It looks like 
<br />
I'm not going to get anywhere with you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to one of the Swat-bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Revive her fully and take her to the robotizizer,&quot; he said &quot;I'll 
<br />
be there shortly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sally had located Sonic and told him that Bunnie had 
<br />
most likely been captured.  They decided that Sally would wait there while 
<br />
Sonic charged off towards the prison block.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie had been encased in the giant glass cylinder in the massive 
<br />
robotizizer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During these last few moments of your natural life, I might be 
<br />
convinced to stop the procedure if only you would tell me what I want to 
<br />
know,&quot; Packbell was saying.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I guess that's the end of my natural life,&quot; said Bunnie 
<br />
defiantly &quot;I'm taking their secrets with me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well,&quot; said Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the control bot.   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is this thing charged yet?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Five minutes to full operational charge,&quot; the bot reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the comm. panel sprang to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Urgent!  Commander Packbell, report to the dragon robotizizer 
<br />
immediately.  Prisoner escape attempt under way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; he said to Bunnie &quot;As much as I hate missing a rebel 
<br />
robotization, I hate missing a dragon more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the bot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take over.  Use standard procedures,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked from the room, Bunnie called after him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You may get me, and you may get a hundred more, but one day the 
<br />
freedom fighters are going to beat Robotnik!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell paused at the door and said &quot;I doubt that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, under his breath he said &quot;because I'll get to him first.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the machine indicated that it was ready to begin.  The 
<br />
bot turned it on.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was enveloped in a yellow beam of energy.  A sudden pain 
<br />
shot through her as the machine began to alter her body on the molecular 
<br />
level.  The feelings and sensations moving through her body were intense.  
<br />
After a few moments she passed out.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, without warning, Sonic the Hedgehog shot into the room and 
<br />
slammed into the control bot, tearing it to peaces.  He shut off the 
<br />
robotizizer as fast as he could.  Running over to the cylinder, he opened 
<br />
it.  Bunnie's limp form fell out onto the floor.  Sonic gasped in shock.  
<br />
Her legs and left arm had been completely transformed into robotic limbs.  
<br />
After he recovered from the shock, he examined her.  She was still breathing, 
<br />
but her pulse was weak.  He picked her up and ran from the room.  After 
<br />
meeting Sally at the outskirts of the city, they raced back to Knothole at 
<br />
top speed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie lay still as death in her bed.  The only indications that she 
<br />
was still alive were the soft beeps of Rotor's pulse monitor and Bookshire's 
<br />
brain wave scanner.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is she going to be alright?&quot; Sally finally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor and Bookshire looked up from the numerous books they were 
<br />
reading.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't know,&quot; Rotor admitted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There isn't anything in any of these books on a person being 
<br />
partially robotizized,&quot; said Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is totally new stuff,&quot; said Rotor &quot;Bunnie is the planet's 
<br />
first cybernetic life form, possessing both organic and artificial parts.  
<br />
No one knows how to deal with such a concept.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't you at least give me a best and worst case scenario?&quot; pressed 
<br />
Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two hesitated for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; began Bookshire &quot;the worst that could happen is her brain 
<br />
never recovers from the shock, the brain waves break down, and she dies.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Or,&quot; continued Rotor &quot;the best that could happen is her body makes 
<br />
the adjustments and she fully recovers.  Of course, any of a hundred of 
<br />
things in between those two could happen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sally &quot;let me know if her condition changes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can count on it,&quot; said Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally left and went for a walk.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she walked down by the power ring pool, she saw Sonic sitting 
<br />
by himself on a log.  She walked up and sat down next to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How are you?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked up as if noticing her for the first time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay I guess,&quot; he replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong?&quot; Sally asked, her voice filled with concern.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sat there without answering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, Sonic.  You know you can talk to me,&quot; she continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was too slow,&quot; answered Sonic, quietly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wasn't fast enough to save her,&quot; he continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, it wasn't your fault,&quot; she said.        
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes it was,&quot; Sonic insisted &quot;If only I had been faster.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, I know no one blames you for what happened,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you know Bunnie won't,&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If anything Bunnie will probably be thankful that you saved her at 
<br />
all,&quot; Sally said &quot;If it hadn't been for you, she'd be getting shipped off 
<br />
to some factory by now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe you're right, &quot;admitted Sonic &quot;but I'll have to think about 
<br />
it for a while.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I understand,&quot; Sally said.  she stood up and left him to his 
<br />
thoughts.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After she finished her walk, Sally returned to Bunnie's hut where 
<br />
a surprising site met her eyes.  Bunnie was conscious and crying into 
<br />
Bookshire's arms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She regained consciousness a few minutes ago,&quot; explained Rotor 
<br />
&quot;When we broke the news to her she burst out in tears.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few minutes, Bunnie calmed down a little and laid back in 
<br />
bed.  Sally sat down next to the bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not as bad as you think,&quot; said Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And how's that?&quot; demanded Bunnie &quot;Look at me!  I'm a freak!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No you're not,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then what would you call me,&quot; Bunnie insisted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three hesitated for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're just who you always have been,&quot; said Sally &quot;a kind, loving 
<br />
creature who's dedicated, smart, and great to be around.  You may have 
<br />
changed physically, but you're still the same person we all know, and love.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It will take time for you to adjust to those changes,&quot; said Rotor 
<br />
&quot;but it can happen.  You'll be back to your old self in no time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps,&quot; said Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One month later, Bunnie had progressed at a surprising pace, and 
<br />
she was learning to use her new arm and legs to her advantage.  Bookshire, 
<br />
Rotor, and Bunnie were thrilled as were the rest of the freedom fighters.  
<br />
Bunnie was thrilled that she was getting back to normal and that her name 
<br />
would be recorded in history as the first cybernetic life form, and Rotor 
<br />
and Bookshire were thrilled because they would be known for perfecting 
<br />
cybernetic therapy.  One day, Bunnie was relaxing by the power ring pool 
<br />
when Sonic, who had been somewhat distant, approached her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie,&quot; he said &quot;I have a question.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it,&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you blame me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For what?&quot;     
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For not saving you in time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well now what ever prompted an idea like that,&quot; asked Bunnie &quot;If 
<br />
anything, you saved me in the nick of time.  If you had been any longer, 
<br />
the process would have completed and I'd be a robotic slave in Robotnik's 
<br />
work force.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really,&quot; confirmed Bunnie &quot;and hopefully, one day, we'll find a 
<br />
way to reverse this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; said Sonic, turning to gaze at the setting sun in the west.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One day...&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE END
<br />
