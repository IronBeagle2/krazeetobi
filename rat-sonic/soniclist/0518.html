&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 3
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wish Sonic was here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally took her cloak and wrapped it tighter against herself
<br />
as she sat closer to the small fire she had built.  The wind was
<br />
picking up in the bottom of the canyon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Above her, growing from the floor of the canyon like some
<br />
improbable stone plant, loomed Dragonsnest.  It had been the
<br />
center of dragon civilization on Mobius centuries before, but the
<br />
number of dragons had been in decline even before Robotnik's
<br />
takeover, and the few dragons who had evaded capture were in
<br />
hiding.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sonic had agreed to a compromise: Sonic would
<br />
transport her close to Dragonsnest and then leave.  Which he did
<br />
with obvious reluctance.  Sally had no idea who or what was
<br />
waiting for her, but it was clear she had to meet it alone.  No
<br />
matter how much she disliked the prospect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She leaned her back against the stone tower, listening for
<br />
any sound that might come her way.  It was not fear, however,
<br />
that caused her to wish for Sonic's company.  It was loneliness,
<br />
a loneliness made even more profound in a deserted stone canyon,
<br />
waiting for moonrise.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thirty feet away, hidden in the darkness, a small figure
<br />
crouched behind a massive boulder.  It was Sonic.  Sally may have
<br />
told him to go back to Knothole, he told himself, but she didn't
<br />
say anything about not doubling back at the first opportunity to
<br />
keep an eye on her.  Besides, someone had to make sure that the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters didn't lose the brains of the outfit. 
<br />
Satisfied that what he thought he'd heard was just the wind,
<br />
Sonic continued his vigil.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, he told himself, maybe he'd feel the same way if someone
<br />
came up to him and told him he had a chance of finding his own
<br />
mother.  Like *that* had a chance of happening!  For as far back
<br />
as he could remember he'd been an orphan, living with his Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  Until the day Robotnik took over Mobius and he went to
<br />
live in Knothole.  Still, why was Sally doing this by herself?
<br />
Sally's usually way cautious, Sonic told himself, but sometimes
<br />
she could be so...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's thoughts were interrupted as someone or something
<br />
grabbed him from behind.  Sonic wasn't used to being lost in
<br />
thought, but the figure had crept up on him absolutely
<br />
undetected.  The figure then hauled Sonic to a standing position
<br />
while Sonic felt the tip of some kind of knife being pressed
<br />
against his throat.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is this your idea of following instructions?&quot; the stranger
<br />
called out to Sally...in Sally's voice!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you...No!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You were told to come alone!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't know he was following me, I swear!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hold it right there,&quot; the stranger said, for Sally had
<br />
begun running toward them and was now about ten feet away.  &quot;You
<br />
know this busybody?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;His name's Sonic.  He's my friend....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like you've picked a friend who couldn't be trusted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's not true!  I've trusted him with my life more times
<br />
than I can count.  We fight together against Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not interested in your little war.&quot;  The figure paused.
<br />
There was no way to read her thoughts, for her face was once
<br />
again hidden behind a veil.  &quot;So you trust this fool with your
<br />
life.  Let's see how far that trust extends.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, the figure took the knife away from Sonic's
<br />
throat, and with the other hand produced a coiled length of rope
<br />
from under her cloak.  She tossed it to Sally, who caught it
<br />
before it hit the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you're truly familiar with royal customs, you know how
<br />
to put someone under protection.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally didn't say anything to the stranger.  Instead, she
<br />
deftly tied one end of the rope into a slip knot and placed her
<br />
head through the loop.  She handed the other end to the stranger,
<br />
then gave Sonic the center section of the rope to hold.  All the
<br />
time she kept her eyes on the stranger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm impressed,&quot; the stranger said.  &quot;You've remembered
<br />
something that has long been forgotten.  I accept your offer,&quot;
<br />
she said as she let the rope drop.  Sally then took the loop from
<br />
around her neck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger coiled up the rope and replaced it under her
<br />
cloak.  Then, taking a half-burned log from the fire and using it
<br />
as a torch, she led Sonic and Sally into Dragonsnest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Sal, what was that all about?&quot; Sonic whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's an ancient rite that I learned about.  The royal
<br />
family of Mobius had the right to intervene and show mercy to
<br />
someone who might have committed a crime.  That ceremony with the
<br />
rope was my way of saying that I'm willing to be held accountable
<br />
for your actions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean, 'accountable'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you transgress, you go free and she has the right to
<br />
kill me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No talking!&quot; the stranger called out.  &quot;And that means no
<br />
questions as well.  You'll have your answers soon enough,
<br />
anyway.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most dragons prefer to nest in the open, yet the ancient
<br />
tower was shot through with interior nurseries and storerooms. 
<br />
It was to one of these that the stranger led Sonic and Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was more like a barren cave.  Several ancient
<br />
dragon's egg shells lay in a corner, lit by a low fire in the
<br />
center of the room.  In another corner, Sally could see the dim
<br />
outline of someone laying on a straw mat.  The person's breathing
<br />
was steady but mechanical, as if a machine were doing the
<br />
breathing for them. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stranger threw her log torch on the fire.  It flared up,
<br />
and both Sally and Sonic gasped in alarm.  The figure on the mat
<br />
was mostly robot--only her head and right arm had been spared.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who is that?&quot; Sally asked in a shocked whisper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our mother.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OUR mother?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure undid her face veil and slipped her cloak hood
<br />
off her head.  Neither Sonic nor Sally could believe it.  The
<br />
figure looked exactly like Sally.  There was, however, something
<br />
in the darkness of the eyes, the hard set of the mouth.  This was
<br />
a person who had seen too much too soon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are twin sisters, you and I.  My name is Sandy.  And
<br />
SHE...she was once Queen Alicia of Mobius.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But...but what's she doing here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's dying.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
<br />
