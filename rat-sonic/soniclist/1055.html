Act 1:The Attack and Recovery
<br />
Part 1:The Attack
<br />
Sonic T Hedgehog,official protecter of Mobious,destroyed
<br />
Robotnick's Death Egg 1 year ago.Now 18,Sonic and Tails live
<br />
a carefree life with Sonic's Uncle Chuck,a great inventor.
<br />
&quot;Italian plumbers.I hate 'em.And that dog of a dog is the
<br />
worst!&quot;Sonic grumbled.
<br />
&quot;Sonic,I have to use the bathroom,&quot;complained Tails.
<br />
&quot;OK,keed.But use the one by Uncle Chuck's bedroom,&quot;replied
<br />
Sonic.
<br />
&quot;But there are spiders in there...&quot;
<br />
&quot;They're not poisonous!&quot;
<br />
Tails shuffled into the bathroom.
<br />
&quot;Sonic come here...&quot;
<br />
&quot;If you were going to say quick it wouldn't change much!&quot;
<br />
Uncle Chuck was holding two pointy shoes and a glowing ring.
<br />
&quot;These are for you.You can travel at Supersonic speeds using
<br />
them,&quot;said Chuck.
<br />
&quot;But what about Speed?He needs them more than me!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Speed wouldn't use them.Your brother's as lazy as a
<br />
hedgehog.&quot;
<br />
&quot;My brother IS a hedgehog!&quot;corrected Sonic.
<br />
Suddenly,there was an earthquake and a ripping sound.Sonic,
<br />
holding Chuck,raced to speeds room.
<br />
&quot;I've got Sonic,Speed,&quot;suddenly a claw grabbed Chuck,&quot;And
<br />
your Uncle,too.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Robotnik,that's Speed.I'm Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Don't think you can fool me,hedgehog.I love watching the
<br />
weakest perish!HAHAHA!&quot;Robotnik flew away.Tails entered the
<br />
room.
<br />
&quot;Was there an earthquake?&quot;Tails asked.
<br />
&quot;Worse.We have our work cut out for us,&quot;Sonic replied.
<br />

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 2:Sonic Chaos
<br />
Sonic and Tails thought they destroyed the Death Egg and Dr.
<br />
Ivo Robotnik.But they were wrong...REALLY wrong!Robotnik
<br />
grabbed Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck,signaling the
<br />
start of a 25 act adventure...
<br />
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
<br />
Sonic zoomed passed Green Hill...or what was left of it.It
<br />
was now polluted and uninhabatanted.Suddenly,Sonic tripped..
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OOF!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Pweencess Sally,we caught one!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Workerbot?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Wewe.&quot;
<br />
Sonic opened his eyes.In front of him was a fox with a sword
<br />
&quot;I'm no workerbot!Anyway...what's a workerbot?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Oops.I was wrong.You are a hedgehog,no?&quot;the fox asked.
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;Sonic got up...and fell again.This time on purpose.In
<br />
front of him was Princess Sally.
<br />
&quot;Get up.I'm not a princess of much now.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Robotnik attacked Mobious.There are only a few survivors.
<br />
Who are you?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sonic T. Hedgehog at your service.&quot;
<br />
&quot;YOU were spared?What luck!Maybe we can restore Mobious!&quot;
<br />
&quot;We WILL restore Mobious.Uh,how.&quot;
<br />
&quot;First we must find the Chaos Emeralds..&quot;
<br />
&quot;You mean these?&quot;
<br />
Sonic pulled out 7 emeralds.
<br />
&quot;No Sonic.The emeralds of life.Those are the emeralds of
<br />
power.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Pardon me,my pweencess...&quot;the fox interupted.
<br />
&quot;Oops,how rude.This is Antoine,the royal guard.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Yes,but what is the 2nd thing?&quot;Antoine asked.
<br />
&quot;Find all the survivors of the attack.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot;Sonic said.
<br />
Tails finally came out of the tree he was hiding in and
<br />
followed Sonic and co.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog X

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 3:&quot;Climb Up a Tree and Act Like a Nut&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails THOUGHT they killed Robotnik...until he
<br />
took Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck.After falling
<br />
into a trap,Sonic learned that Robotnik cleared out Mobious
<br />
and Sonic must get the 6 Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails finally caught up with Sonic.&quot;Where are we going?&quot;
<br />
he asked.
<br />
Sonic stopped,&quot;I dunno',li'l bro'.But I once had them...&quot;
<br />
&quot;And you locked them in the secret zone!&quot;Tails interupted.
<br />
&quot;If I may interupt,I have heard certain survivors recovered
<br />
them after the attack,&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Where'd' ya' hear that?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE!We can use it to track them down&quot;
<br />
Sally whipped out a pocket sized electronic device and
<br />
turned it on.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,search for emerald file,access,run data,evaluate.&quot;
<br />
&quot;The only emerald within the 10 mile radius range is in the
<br />
great forest,the only part of Mobious Robotnik stayed out
<br />
of,&quot;Nicole said.
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot;
<br />
&quot;NO!Not more speed,&quot;Antoine pleaded.
<br />
&quot;Hope you like dust,Ant!&quot;Sonic grabbed Antoine and Sally.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*cough**cough*ACK!&quot;
<br />
A squirrely cough came from high above a tree.Sonic stopped.
<br />
A squirrel came down.
<br />
&quot;Stop kicking up so much dust!It should halfway to the moon,
<br />
now.Who are you,anyway?Sonic the Hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oops,sorry.And that's probably Princess Sally...ha!&quot;
<br />
&quot;YES!IT IS!&quot;Sally was gritting her teeth.Sonic eyed the
<br />
emerald the squirrel was holding.
<br />
&quot;Would you,by any chance,want to join the fight against
<br />
Robotnik?&quot;He asked.
<br />
&quot;Sure.The name's Minerva.This should be a beautiful
<br />
relationship,royalty and heroism...&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 4:Cagey Caper
<br />
Sonic and Tails THOUGHT they killed Robotnik,until he
<br />
kidnapped Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck.Learning
<br />
about the attack that cleared Mobious,Sonic (with some new
<br />
friends) started the quest by finding the blue Chaos Emerald
<br />
and a squirrely ally,Minerva.
<br />
&quot;The red Chaos Emerald is west of this vicinity,in sector
<br />
9-3.&quot;NICOLE read.
<br />
&quot;That's an Aquatic Ruin!It's WAY too dangerous!&quot;Tails
<br />
remembered.After pointing this out,Antoine decided to stay
<br />
put.Then,without further hesitation,they took off.
<br />

<br />
Sally accessed some information about the Aquatic Ruins.
<br />
&quot;The Aquatic Ruins was an ancient city until it was
<br />
destroyed by Robotnik.There are readings of organic life on
<br />
it.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Organic life!Someone still lives!&quot;Minerva shouted.
<br />
However,the Aquatic Ruins was now a beach,with no signs of
<br />
anything.However,further inspection indicated a metallic
<br />
fish...RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!It had a steel grate in front
<br />
and 4 fins.Suddenly,Sonic was sucked toward it.&quot;Don't worry,
<br />
I have a plan!&quot;Sonic started spinning,but then the grate
<br />
opened and Sonic,along with the others,were sucked in.Then
<br />
the &quot;fish&quot; returned to the surface.&quot;NO!That's not a
<br />
workerbot!&quot;A sea lion said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;That's the second time I was called a workerbot!WHAT is a
<br />
workerbot!&quot;Sonic said.
<br />
&quot;SONIC THE HEDGEHOG?!What are YOU doing here?&quot;the sea lion
<br />
aasked.
<br />
&quot;We came to find a very specific jewel...the red Chaos
<br />
Emerald.&quot;Sally explained.
<br />
&quot;OH!I use that to power my fish!You can have it if you need
<br />
it.My name's Rotor.I know Sonic,Tails,and you,but who's
<br />
the...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Squirrel?I'm Minerva.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Rotor,you are obviously against Robotnik.How would like to
<br />
join the Freedom Fighters?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Freedom Fighters?Since when were we called Freedom Fighters
<br />
Sally asked.
<br />
&quot;Since now.So,Rotor...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Okay.Sounds good!&quot;
<br />
&quot;There.Now,we have a fox waiting in the Great Forest...&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 5:Singing in the rain...of rocks!
<br />
Sonic and Tails saw Robotnik kidnap Sonic's brother Speed
<br />
and Uncle Chuck.After learning about his attack on Mobious
<br />
and recruiting some Freedom Fighters:Princess Sally,the
<br />
royal guard,Antoine,Minerva (a squirrel),and Rotor (a sea
<br />
lion mechanic),Sonic must find the last 4 Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
&quot;The Underground Zone!That's Robotnik's territory!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sonic,MOBIOUS is Robotnik's territory.&quot;Sally pointed out.
<br />
&quot;Sonic!I modified the hovercrafts I made before the attack.
<br />
We should be able to catch up with you!&quot;Rotor called.
<br />
&quot;Cool,Rote.Hang on tight,'cause we're going warp 7!&quot;
<br />
With that,Sonic,Tails,Sally,Minerva,and Rotor took off for
<br />
the Underground Zone (though Sonic was almost sure he forgot
<br />
something).
<br />

<br />
Once there,they found their first complication...the hover-
<br />
boards weren't working right.Sonic was able to get them off
<br />
before the hoverboards crashed...but Sonic and the others
<br />
landed in a mining cart going downward.They crashed,but no
<br />
harm was done.Then a moniter lowered from the ceiling,and
<br />
displayed Robotnik's face.&quot;Welcome,&quot;he said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I believe you are looking for this,&quot;the moniter raised to
<br />
reveal the green Chaos Emerald.&quot;If you want it take it...
<br />
although you will be smashed like a bug,&quot;then,a gate dropped
<br />
behind the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&quot;Well,I guess we have no choice!&quot;Sonic took the emerald.True
<br />
to Robotnik's word,the ceiling crumbled.
<br />
Suddenly,a kangaroo appeared and pushed away the falling
<br />
rocks.A rock fell over Minerva,and Sonic crushed it.Then the
<br />
kangaroo pushed away the rock about to crush Sonic.And then,
<br />
the last rock fell...right on Sally's leg!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hmmm.She'll be okay,as long as she stays off that leg,&quot;the
<br />
kangaroo said.
<br />
&quot;Well,she can't move around a lot.We need to get her in a
<br />
safe place,&quot;Rotor suggested.
<br />
&quot;THAT'S IT!THAT'S what I forgot...Antoine.&quot;Sonic suddenly
<br />
burst.
<br />
&quot;Say,isn't HE in a safe place?&quot;Minerva reminded.
<br />
&quot;We'll,let's go back...and take him with us.&quot;Sally was
<br />
anxious.
<br />
&quot;The name's Leaper.&quot;Leaper said.

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 6:Discovery of Knothole
<br />
Robotnik captured Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck,not
<br />
to mention most of Mobious.Not only that,but Sonic and
<br />
Tails,along with Sally,Antoine,Minerva,Rotor,and Leaper,must
<br />
collect the 6 Chaos Emeralds.At the moment,though,Sally's
<br />
leg is crushed and Antoine is lost!
<br />
Sonic,holding Sally,rushed into the Great Forest in search
<br />
of Antoine...and proper sanctuary.Sonic's luck shone,
<br />
however,when Antoine popped out of the bushes.
<br />
&quot;Sally,you must see this.It is magnifeec!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Magnificent,Antoine,magnificent,&quot;Sally corrected Antoine.
<br />
&quot;Oh,come on.&quot;
<br />
Antoine led Sonic and Sally to a village.Rotor,Minerva,and
<br />
Leaper met them on hovercrafts.
<br />
&quot;Ooo.Beaver cottages.How intriguing.&quot;Minerva said.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,access beaver dwellings.Might as well know what
<br />
we're living in.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Accessing,Sally.No file on beaver dwellings.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Steady,steady,slow,slow...&quot;
<br />
&quot;I hate that word.&quot;
<br />
Sonic was in one of the huts,lowering Sally onto a bed.
<br />
&quot;There.I should be safe here.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
Sonic went outside.&quot;Tails,guard Sally while Rotor,Minerva,
<br />
Leaper,and I look for the last 3 emeralds.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes,Sonic.No creepy 'bot will get past me.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Cool.Now,I'm...wait,I almost forgot.&quot;
<br />
Sonic went inside and grabbed NICOLE.&quot;Mind if I borrow
<br />
this?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;Sally answered.
<br />
&quot;Okay.If you need anything,tell Tails.See ya'!&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 7:Sonic Spinball
<br />
Robotnik wiped out Mobious except a few survivors.
<br />
Sonic has collected the blue,red,and green Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
Sonic needs the pink,l.blue,and purple emeralds.
<br />
Sonic has 3 new friends:Minerva,Rotor,and Leaper.
<br />
Sally is hiding in Knothole with Tails and Antoine guarding.
<br />
&quot;MAYDAY,MAYDAY.Unknown user.&quot;
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,It's Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Accessing Sonic.Commencing voice comparison.Hello,Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Now how does Sally do this.Hmmm.NICOLE,scan for Chaos
<br />
Emeralds.&quot;
<br />
&quot;No emeralds in range,Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Do you think they're in the secret zone,guys?&quot;asked Sonic.
<br />
&quot;It seems possible,but we don't know yet,&quot;Rotor replied.
<br />
&quot;There's only one way to find out.NICOLE,scan for
<br />
trans-dimensional warps.&quot;
<br />
&quot;There are 2 in range.Warp #1 leads to Earth,a terran planet
<br />
Warp #2 leads to the secret zone.&quot;
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,show coordinates of warp #2.&quot;NICOLE projected a
<br />
holographic map of Mobious in the 100-mile radius range.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well,Sonic,it's now or never.&quot;Minerva said.
<br />
&quot;And it's now.BANZAI!&quot;Sonic leaped into the warp with the
<br />
others following.Sonic was spinning,jumping,and leaping off
<br />
platforms in no time.Rotor slid on his belly directly into
<br />
the goal,and disappeared.Leaper tried to hit the gate with
<br />
his head by bouncing off the bumpers...but when he got
<br />
there,the maze spun 180' degrees,and Leaper hit the goal.
<br />
When Minerva finally gained her balance,she used her tail to
<br />
save Sonic from the goal...but after that she slipped again
<br />
and fell into the goal herself.However,the gate on Sonic's
<br />
side was gone and he hit the emerald,then disappeared.Sonic
<br />
joined the other Freedom Fighters on Mobious...with a pink
<br />
emerald in hand.

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 8:Sonic vs. Thunder
<br />
Sorry,there is too little space to print the reminder.You
<br />
should know by now.
<br />
&quot;The yellow Chaos Emerald is in sector
<br />
1,2,4,8,16,32,OVERLOAD!&quot;
<br />
Just then,something tackled Sonic.He woke up to find a neon
<br />
blue hedgehog,also knocked out cold,holding an emerald.Sonic
<br />
was just about to grab it when he was electricuted.
<br />
&quot;I don't think so.You're going to have to earn my emerald...
<br />
in a race.&quot;
<br />
&quot;A race.Don't you know who I am?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Dead meat!The destination is Green Hill.&quot;
<br />
Sonic and Thunder got ready.
<br />
&quot;We start on three.Ready...THREE!&quot;
<br />
Both hegehogs were off.However,the stranger got ahead of
<br />
Sonic by 1 foot per second.Sonic knew that Green Hill wasn't
<br />
exactly around the corner.He thought of Green Hill and his
<br />
last moments with Uncle Chuck,gazing at the power ring...
<br />

<br />
THE POWER RING!It was still in Sonic's backpack,and in great
<br />
shape.Sonic got it out,and focused on it's power.Sonic shot
<br />
out at warp 2...twice the other hedgehog's speed.
<br />
Startled,the other hedgehog shot a lightning bolt from his
<br />
fingers,which hit Sonic's power ring.It absorbed the power,
<br />
sending Sonic warp 3.Not only that,the shot made the neon
<br />
hedgehog fall to see Sonic standing on top of Green Hill.
<br />

<br />
Sonic met up with the other Freedom Fighters,then carried
<br />
them to where the glow-in-the-dark pincushion &lt;G&gt; fell.They
<br />
coaxed him to talk.&quot;I was captured by Robotnik.I was due
<br />
after some other old hedgehog was robotisized.But right
<br />
before the process was completed,he messed up the control
<br />
box.He was robotisized,but I was electrified.&quot;
<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot;Minerva asked.
<br />
&quot;I don't know.I didn't know anything until the emerald made
<br />
me remember the essentials.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well,I name you Lightning,after that SHOCKING display of
<br />
power.&quot;Rotor cracked.He didn't know Lightning would accept
<br />
the name.He also joined the Freedom Fighters...though
<br />
everybody expected that.
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S.Kate,you're coming in next time,so be patient!

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 9:Kate's Creation
<br />
If you don't know what's going on,WHY THE HECK ARE YOU
<br />
READING THIS STORY!Don't worry,you'll eventually catch on!
<br />
Sonic didn't have time to check with NICOLE.Immediatly,when
<br />
the emeralds got close to each other,they flew away...with
<br />
Sonic trying not to get ahead!
<br />

<br />
The emeralds went into Sonic's hut.Then they started banging
<br />
on Chuck's closet.Sonic never opened the closet...it was
<br />
forbidden.But Sonic,and the other Freedom Fighters opened it
<br />
and saw a white Chaos Emerald...the final emerald.And was in
<br />
Sonic's house!Why didn't Chuck tell him.Then,it started
<br />
speaking...
<br />
&quot;Where have you five been?&quot;It said.The Freedom Fighters were
<br />
too surprised to comment.
<br />
&quot;Oh,I can talk.That feels good.Thanks!&quot;The red one said.
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?&quot;The white
<br />
one asked.
<br />
&quot;We don't know them.They should introduce themselves to
<br />
us...of course,we all know Sonic.&quot;the yellow said.
<br />
&quot;I'm M-m-minerva,not too mention one scared squirrel girl!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Rotor,a handyman.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Leaper...KEEP AWAY!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Lightning...or am I?Oh,I get so scrambled sometimes.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well,I am the white Chaos Emerald,head of language.See why
<br />
the others didn't talk before?&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the red emerald,head of power...If Rotor didn't use me
<br />
as a battery.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the yellow emerald,head of knowledge.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the pink emerald and all I do is transportation.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the green emerald,the height choice!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I create things,take for instance Mobious.And now,I think,
<br />
is a time for creation...&quot;
<br />
&quot;NOT ANOTHER BEING!REMEMBER LAST TIME?&quot;the yellow bellowed.
<br />
&quot;Relax.We'll start this one's life as an adult.&quot;
<br />
The emeralds gathered in a circle and spun.Then they gave
<br />
off a charge to the middle.It took shape and then the energy
<br />
turned into a human,which dropped on the ground.
<br />
&quot;Darn.She's only 11.&quot;The pink commented.
<br />
&quot;It's alright.If she's not defective now,she won't be later.
<br />
Remember...&quot;the yellow was interupted.
<br />
&quot;No,I refuse to remember.Let bygones be bygones.&quot;Pink said.
<br />
The human got up.&quot;Hello.I'm,I'm...who am I?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Kate.Kate Chaos.And,you're not a rebel...thank goodness!&quot;
<br />
Then,the door shattered,and Robotnik stepped in...

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 4:Escape from Robotropolis
<br />
Filled with anger,Sonic charged at the man who captured his
<br />
family.The,he was captured by nets from tall,dark robots.
<br />
&quot;Ah,Sonic.I see you've met my SWAT-bots,&quot;Robotnik smirked...
<br />
The red emerald flew into Kate's hand.She aimed it at a
<br />
SWAT-bot,and an energy bolt zapped it.The SWAT-bot was
<br />
destroyed.Then,the wall broke down.Millions of SWAT-bots
<br />
were in front of the hut.Lightning and Kate zapped all they
<br />
could,but they eventually ran out of juice.The Freedom
<br />
Fighters were overcome.
<br />

<br />
By listening to Robotnik's babbling,Sonic learned they were
<br />
in Robotropolis...dark and polluted.They were carried off to
<br />
be robotisized and turned into workerbots.Sonic still didn't
<br />
know what workerbots were.
<br />
&quot;After you learn your fate,you will become my mindless
<br />
slaves.I'll start with you,Speed,&quot;Robotnik decided.
<br />
&quot;I'm Sonic I tell you.Speed wouldn't have had so many
<br />
allys.&quot;
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter.You'll both be hedgehogs with bolts in
<br />
your neck...&quot;CRASH!Robotnik was interupted by something
<br />
shaking the tower in which the Freedom Fighters were
<br />
imprisoned.&quot;What was that?&quot;
<br />
Robotnik looked out the window.He saw a purple hedgehogs
<br />
spiny head.A cambot spyed on it,and Robotnik monitered the
<br />
mysterious hedgehog close-up.And then the hedgehog found it.
<br />
&quot;Don't look behind you,&quot;he warned.Robotnik looked at the
<br />
elevator.There,at the ready with lasers,were Sally and
<br />
Tails.Sally gave Robotnik a blast that knocked him back a
<br />
little.&quot;That's for my leg.HEY!&quot;Sally was grabbed by a
<br />
SWAT-bot.Tails blasted it,and then a transport-bot crashed
<br />
through the window right into the robotisizer controls!
<br />
The hedgehog stepped out.He looked exactly like Sonic,but he
<br />
was smaller and purple.&quot;Hello,am I late?Oh,it doesn't
<br />
matter.&quot;Then,he pulled the jail bar switch and the Freedom
<br />
Fighters were free.
<br />

<br />
There wasn't much time for questions.The elevator arrived
<br />
with 3 SWAT-bots,and flybots were attacking.Kate and
<br />
Lightning blasted bots.Minerva used Tails's blaster (which
<br />
she was skilled with).Rotor used his screwdriver and slashed
<br />
the SWAT-bots.Sonic,Tails,and the guest of honor spun
<br />
through the flybots.Laser shots filled the tower.
<br />
Robotnik escaped through the trashed transport-bot.More
<br />
flybots and more SWAT-bots entered.Finally,Rotor whipped out
<br />
his remote control for the hovercrafts and called them.
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;Sonic asked the hedgehog.
<br />
&quot;Just call me Hedgehog X.WHOA!&quot;the ledge Hedgehog X backed
<br />
into crumbled,taking him with it.Then the hoverboards
<br />
arrived and the Freedom Fighters made a retreat.
<br />
&quot;Friends,&quot;Sally started,&quot;we did a lot today.We banded
<br />
together to stop Robotnik.We formed the FREEDOM FIGHTERS!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yah,we did a lot today.Let's go home and take a rest.&quot;Sonic
<br />
suggested.And they did just that.END OF ACT 1     Hedgehog X
<br />
