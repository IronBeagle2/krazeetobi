<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Actually, videogame systems are much more stable than PC's. A videogame 
</em><br />
system takes on average 5 years to become phased out, a new PC does this 
<br />
in about 6 months. Not to mention that a computer is a serious investment 
<br />
for some people, if all they want to do is play games, what can beat 
<br />
paying $90 for a system and then around $50 for games, not to mention 
<br />
that a videogame system is much easier to use and doesn't require its 
<br />
user to understand OS's.&lt;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Actually, it doesn't matter which brand PC you buy, as they will all run the
<br />
same software (unless it's a MAC). So if you buy a game for a PC, chances are
<br />
the only changes you'll require is a possible memory upgrade. Or if it plays
<br />
on WIndows instead of DOS. 
<br />

<br />
However, with gaming systems, you have the Genesis, the Sega CD, Game Gear,
<br />
32X , Saturn, Super NES, Game Boy, Lynx, 3DO, Sony Playstation, and many
<br />
&nbsp;others that I can't think of 'cause I'm too busy to follow them all to
<br />
choose from. You pick a system because you like the games, then a new system
<br />
comes out and you have to make a choice because neither system's games are
<br />
compatible with each other. On top of that, there's the accessories that are
<br />
available for each system, plus buying or renting the games. So gaming is not
<br />
a cheap proposition by any stretch of the imagination. 
<br />

<br />
Kiken then goes on:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The average age of a US Genesis 
</em><br />
owner is 18, and the average age of a US Sega CD owner is 21, basically 
<br />
college students like myself. Those with lots of money to burn. But 
<br />
again, its SOA's white-coats who think we want games like Corpse Killer, 
<br />
instead of our &quot;childish&quot; Sonic games. This is where the problem comes in.&lt;
<br />

<br />
I don't know where you get your information regarding the average age of a
<br />
video game consumer, but I'm speaking from first hand knowledge both as a
<br />
parent and someone who used to work in retail selling video game systems that
<br />
the average purchaser was more often than not a parent who bought a system
<br />
for their kids whether they were in grade school or college. Were college
<br />
kids the biggest customers? No way. High school kids and younger with their
<br />
parents far outnumbered college kids when a new game was released on sale,
<br />
whether it was SONIC 3 or MORTAL KOMBAT or NHL HOCKEY.
<br />

<br />
When you say average age, you have to account for people under and over the
<br />
average and that's where you get the number from. The amount of people in
<br />
their 30's buying for their kids 10 and under far exceeds those 19 - 23 in
<br />
college who are into video games. And if you were to check with any licensee
<br />
of SONIC products such as sneakers, comics, cartoon series, t-shirts, books,
<br />
toys and so on, they would tell you that there's more money to be made from
<br />
parents buying for their kids than from college students. This is not meant
<br />
as a knock on college students. This is a business fact. That's why you see
<br />
McDonald's renovating their restaurants with those jungle gyms, in order to
<br />
get the families in to spend more with them. You think TV would worry about
<br />
getting it's act together if they didn't have to? 
<br />

<br />
Enjoy the blue-critter and playing the games and reading the books. We who
<br />
produce the work don't think we're doing anything &quot;childish&quot;. What we do is
<br />
try to produce something that appeals to everyone, something that's extremely
<br />
difficult to do. It's much easier to write a story is you have a specific
<br />
audience that you aim for. If I wrote for just college students, my stories
<br />
would be wildly different. Instead, I have to think more in trying to get
<br />
across something the kids will think is funny while the adults are catching
<br />
on to the stuff between the lines.
<br />

<br />
Believe me, from my vantage point working on Archie's SONIC series, I'm
<br />
convinced SEGA has a strong interest in keeping SONIC at the forefront with
<br />
SEGA customers. If SONIC'S star fades, it won't be because they didn't
<br />
promote him. 
<br />
