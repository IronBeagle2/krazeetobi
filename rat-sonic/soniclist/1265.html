_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
<br />
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
<br />
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
<br />
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot;
<br />
description:
<br />

<br />
Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
<br />
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
<br />
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
<br />
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
<br />
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
<br />
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
<br />
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
<br />
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
<br />
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
<br />
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
<br />
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
<br />
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
<br />
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
<br />
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
<br />
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: &quot;Eight years
<br />
passed.&quot;  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
<br />
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
<br />
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
<br />
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chuck&quot; and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
<br />
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
<br />
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
<br />
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
<br />
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
<br />
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
<br />
encounters &quot;a cute little chipmunk girl&quot;: Princess Sally Acorn. 
<br />
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the &quot;Ro-Bo-Machine.&quot;  Ch. 7:
<br />
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
<br />
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
<br />
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
<br />
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
<br />
them to &quot;Knothole Village&quot; which is &quot;under the forest floor.&quot;
<br />
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ 
<br />
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Snively interrups Robotnik while he's in
<br />
the middle of roboticizing Mobians to report that Sonic has
<br />
joined Sally's cadre of freedom fighters.  Robotnik comes up with
<br />
a plan (via Snively) to capture &quot;one of the weaker freedom
<br />
fighters&quot; to lure Sonic into a trap.  Ch. 2: Nothing much happens
<br />
as characters are introduced as Sally tries to get a meeting off
<br />
the ground.  A deroboticized Uncle Chuck is part of the Knothole
<br />
crowd.  Ch. 3: Bunnie, Sally, Rotor and Antoine are on patrol
<br />
when they are attacked by buzzbombers.  In the process, Bunnie is
<br />
captured.  Ch. 4: While Bunnie is held prisoner, the Knothole
<br />
gang comes up with a &quot;Trojan Robotnik&quot; ploy to get inside. 
<br />
Information about the inside of Robotnik's HQ is provided by
<br />
Uncle Chuck with the aid of a power ring.  Ch. 5: You think
<br />
Robotnik was born yesterday?  He lets the image of himself inside
<br />
his HQ, and still manages to cage Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Antoine
<br />
and Muttski.  Ch. 6: Sonic goes into a spin and cuts the bars of
<br />
the cage.  Sonic takes out a number of bots, and the crew head
<br />
for Bunnie's holding cell, only to find it empty.  Ch. 7: With
<br />
Muttski tracking the scent, the freedom fighters reach the room
<br />
where the roboticized is.  Sonic has to get past some SWATbots to
<br />
get inside, but the roboticization of Bunnie has already begun. 
<br />
Ch. 8: Sonic spins into the machinery, destroying it.  They get
<br />
the half-roboticized Bunnie and split.  They reach a wall as
<br />
Bunnie comes to.  Angered by what's happened to her, she kicks a
<br />
hole in the wall.  Epilogue: Back at Knothole, Uncle Chuck can't
<br />
undo what's been done to Bunnie.  But she's still got her friends
<br />
and her heart, so she accepts her new designation as Bunnie
<br />
Rabbot.

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
<br />
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
<br />
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
<br />
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
<br />
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
<br />
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
<br />
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
<br />
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic &amp; Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
<br />
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
<br />
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
<br />
take out the bots and &quot;haul some serious haunch&quot; back to
<br />
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
<br />
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
<br />
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
<br />
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
<br />
question was one of &quot;brave and true warriors&quot; compiled by Sally's
<br />
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
<br />
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
<br />
fragment:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...beside your bed safe and...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...tucked in tight...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...you cannot fall...
<br />
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
<br />
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
<br />
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
<br />
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
<br />
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
<br />
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
<br />
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
<br />
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
<br />
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
<br />
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
<br />
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
<br />
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
<br />
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
<br />
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
<br />
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
<br />
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
<br />
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
<br />
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
<br />
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of &quot;clues&quot; is
<br />
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
<br />
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
<br />
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
<br />
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
<br />
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
<br />
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
<br />
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
<br />
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
<br />
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
<br />
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
<br />
&quot;bot&quot; were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
<br />
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
<br />
its &quot;prisoners&quot; arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
<br />
and the Freedom Fighters escape.
<br />

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
<br />
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode
<br />
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
<br />
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
<br />
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
<br />
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
<br />
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
<br />
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
<br />
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
<br />
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
<br />
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
<br />
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
<br />
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
<br />
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
<br />
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
<br />
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
<br />
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
<br />
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
<br />
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
<br />
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
<br />
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
<br />
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
<br />
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
<br />
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
<br />
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
<br />
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
<br />
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
<br />
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
<br />
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
<br />
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
<br />
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
<br />
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
<br />
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
<br />
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.
