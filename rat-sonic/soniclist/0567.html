Well.. Either everyone's too busy talking about theories of time travel
<br />
and who their best character is to notice.. but the next installment of
<br />
the Princess Sally Miniseries &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; is in. 
<br />
(At least I got it at my local comic shop yesterday)
<br />

<br />
For those interested we seem to have the same bunch...

Quick Recap of Part I
<br />

<br />
Here we meet Sally and the 'Freedom Fighters: The Next Generation' (FF:TNG).
<br />
( Hamlin [pig], Penelope [platypus], Arlo [armadillo], Dylan [porcupine?] )
<br />
Sally meets 'Former Secret Agent Geoffery St. John' [skunk]' while trying
<br />
to destroy the first of three energy substations needed to cripple
<br />
Robotnik's defensive Net.  St. John joins the group and he helps take out
<br />
the 2nd substation.  The FF:TNG don't like his additude though (especially
<br />
Hamlin).  Sally trusts St. John and belives in his ability to help the group.
<br />

<br />
At the end of Part I however... we see St. John wander off while everyone
<br />
is asleep...  'teleport' to a laboratory somewhere, and look what appears 
<br />
to be a duplicate of Sally in a chamber.
<br />

<br />
---------------
<br />
Now for Part II
<br />

<br />
We open with Hamlin and Geoffery in another spat.  Sally breaks it up and
<br />
tells Geoffery that they've gotta work together as a team instead of fighting
<br />
against each other.  Afterwards they prepare to take on the third substation.
<br />

<br />
Its inside an atoll* so they hang-glide their way in.  On their approach
<br />
Arlo's glider is shot and he crashes in the trees.  After landing, they 
<br />
find Arlo on the ground with a broken leg.  Penelope stays with him as the 
<br />
others go to the substation.
<br />

<br />
( * An atoll is a ringlike island that encloses a lagoon )
<br />

<br />

<br />
They get in easily but as they're setting up explosives, Sally is caught
<br />
by one of Robotnik's Octo-Pods.  Hamlin and Dylan try to discract the 
<br />
octo-pod and also get caught.  Geoffery uses the distraction to plant an
<br />
explosive under the octo-pod.  Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are let go when
<br />
Sally sprays paint in the the octo-pod's eyes.  They all escape in the 
<br />
nick of time.
<br />

<br />
They return to where they left Arlo and Penelope and find them missing
<br />
(no sign of trouble and no tracks leading anywhere).  Sally figures if 
<br />
they left under their own will or not.. its a sign of trouble and should
<br />
get the others out of there.  Hours later, back at camp, Arlo and Penelope 
<br />
haven't returned.
<br />

<br />
Shortly before dawn, while the others are asleep, we see St John taking
<br />
Sally with her (she's asleep)..  teleporting to that lab as before.. and
<br />
placing Sally in a chamber identicle to the one we saw the 'other' Sally.
<br />
St. John contacts Central Command (Robotnik) and tells him of his success
<br />
in gaining the FF:TNG's trust and exchanging Sally.
<br />

<br />
The next morning we see Sally (the duplicate), Hamlin and Dylan ready to 
<br />
raid Robotropolis.. Hamlin wonders about St. John but Sally doesn't seem
<br />
worried about him....
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile... St. John is bringing Sally (in the chamber) to Robotnik.
<br />
Robotnik figures with the Sally-duplicate in place, the others are
<br />
sure to fall into his trap and after Sally's been Roboticized, the
<br />
rebellion will fall.  All part of the Master Plan of Ivo Robotnik!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Well.. this brings up some interesting questions:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Which side is Geoffery St. John on?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to Arlo and Penelope?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;What's Robotnik's EVIL(tm) plan?
<br />
