Ratman then said:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt;  &gt; And if this &quot;rat bashing&quot; becomes a trend, I think i'd like to shut it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; down right now. I'll see how it goes today and tomorrow.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; But I'd rather give it the full week for people to say their goodbyes, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt;&gt; &gt; and possibly advertise for other forums people can use to discuss Sonic.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Please, no threats.  I don't care how much power people have, I HATE 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; them holding it over the little folk's head(s)....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's not a matter of me holding it over anyone's head. I'm just giving a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;warning. 
</em><br />

<br />
It's a threat, Ratman.  You're taking away a very useful communications
<br />
tool from these people already, so saying you might do it a little
<br />
early is quite a damaging thing to do.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd rather give people a chance than just shut it off early.  
</em><br />

<br />
Your statement seems contridictory to your previous actions and statements.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Given a choice between watching 5 days of flames being spammed to the list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or no posts at all, I'd choose nothing. 
</em><br />

<br />
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  That's a
<br />
documented scientific law, you know.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I really just don't want to see people whine. It's not productive. 
</em><br />

<br />
Well, Ratman, perhaps if you weren't basically taking away several people's
<br />
friends, then maybe we'd be a little nicer to you.  After all, if I
<br />
chose to shoot you in the leg, I'd expect that you'd say something 
<br />
about it to the effect of `hey, that's not nice'.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now if someone wants to provide an alternative, then fine, but a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;long-winded &quot;ratman is a jerk&quot; post, I'd rather avoid those. 
</em><br />

<br />
Ratman, if you would have read my statement, you would realize that said
<br />
message has a lot of valid points in it; and that perhaps if you took 
<br />
some of my suggestions to heart, there might be a hope that you would
<br />
realize the error of your ways and keep this list operating.  It wasn't
<br />
just a flame of you, it was a detailed list of your negative actions 
<br />
toward other people on this list that probably discouraged a lot of
<br />
the so called `on-topic' posts which you so desired.
<br />

<br />
Think about this logically for a moment, Ratman.  If people get yelled
<br />
at for posting tidbits of news relevant to Sonic fandom, posting 
<br />
fanfic stories, or participating in a thread regarding the creation
<br />
of a new kind of Sonic fandom, what's left?  Not a lot, except for
<br />
Drazen's FAQ additions and the occasional spam blitzkreig by a newbie.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I do want to give people a chance to say their goodbyes...  wait, I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;already said that. Do I always have to re-explain myself? 
</em><br />

<br />
Your statement had been noted already, Ratman.  It's just a matter of
<br />
the remainder of us being irate at your actions.
<br />

<br />
Joe.
