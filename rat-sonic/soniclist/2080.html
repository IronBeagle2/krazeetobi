<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the females he'd seen in his travels in the south had
<br />
been dressed either in simple tunics and dresses (if poor) or in
<br />
silks and gold (if wealthy, and rather skimpy if they had the looks
<br />
for it).  This one was garbed, instead, in a black leather halter
<br />
and trunks, with tall boots of the same material and plated
<br />
gauntlets.  The rabbit's ear was bent, at least one was, but her
<br />
eyes were those of a warrior, and the large two-handed sword she
<br />
had cast on her back was not any city maiden's toy.  That she
<br />
could-- and did-- carry such a weapon meant she considered herself
<br />
a fighter.  The thin scar across her left eye (fortunate to have
<br />
missed the eye itself) meant she was.  And that no other scars were
<br />
visible meant she was a warrior of skill.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Captain Rabbot,&quot; blurted the innkeeper.  &quot;You should have
<br />
seen him, he--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw, innkeeper,&quot; she interrupted.  &quot;You-- I think you'd
<br />
better come with me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak tightened his grip on his axe.  &quot;If there's some idiot
<br />
law against aiding innkeepers here against demon-tricks--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit laughed.  &quot;By Mosthe', no, swift one.  But anyone
<br />
who can fight like that-- and with such an unusual technique-- will
<br />
interest my mistress immensely.  Besides, there's a bounty of five
<br />
royals for each of the dark Wizard's toys wrecked.  You've made a
<br />
pretty penny today, Son-ak, and I merely thought you'd like to
<br />
collect it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your mistress.  And who is that?  For that, who are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I,&quot; replied the rabbit, &quot;Am Captain Bunnie,  in service to
<br />
her Highness, the Princess Salar-Alicia of House Acorn, and leader
<br />
of her Royal Guards.  And I already... ah... 'heard' of you,
<br />
hedgehog.  You want your fifteen royals or not?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak grinned.  After weeks of boredom, things were looking
<br />
up.  A good fight, gold to refill his almost empty purse, and he'd
<br />
met a female of both obvious bravery and courage-- and, not that he
<br />
allowed himself to notice, beauty as well.  Yes, perhaps his
<br />
fortunes were changing for the better...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the east, a massive form shuddered.  A hand clutched a
<br />
glittering stone, and a quiet snarl escaped thick lips.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sniv.  To me.  Now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shadows produced a short, black swathed figure.  &quot;My
<br />
lord?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Something in the west has destroyed three of my iron golems
<br />
in as many moments.  And when I am about to begin my true plans,
<br />
that is an ill matter.  Ill indeed...You are my master spy, Sniv
<br />
the Quiet.  Go forth, go and learn what causes me such concern at
<br />
this time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you command, Master.&quot;  The figure melted back into the
<br />
shadows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And Roboth-amon, the Dark Wizard of the East, mused on the
<br />
possibility-- for the first time-- that his designs might be in
<br />
peril.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the second
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City of Mobius was, simply put, large.  Larger than
<br />
anything Son-Ak had ever seen, or even dreamed of seeing.  To Son-
<br />
ak, born and bred amongst the barbarian tribes of the north, a
<br />
village was large in his mind.  A town was huge.  A city was
<br />
something he had never even conceived of.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the City called Mobius was the largest in the known world.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply put, the hedgehog was steeling every nerve in his body
<br />
to keep from freaking.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old cliche', true, but an accurate one-- the sounds, the
<br />
smells, the sights, and above all the people-- the teeming crowds
<br />
of people-- of all the different races of the world, talking,
<br />
bargaining, arguing, flirting, debating, all in one place that was
<br />
larger than the hedgehog had ever dreamed possible-- that was
<br />
larger than he COULD have dreamed, in fact-- buying, selling,
<br />
dealing...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he could be forgiven.  The Great Marketplace of Mobius
<br />
could stagger even the most jaded of travelers.  It was a violent
<br />
sensory overload that numbed the body of all but the most obvious
<br />
of stimuli.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it is no surprise that the normally alert barbarian never
<br />
noticed the small, stealthy hand slip under his belt, lift his
<br />
(severely depleted) purse, and make off with it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little thief slipped into an alleyway, looked about to be
<br />
certain that no-one had seen him, and then removed his tattered
<br />
cloak.  Clad now in only a battered loincloth and a equally
<br />
disreputable vest, he rolled up the cloak, bent slightly over, and
<br />
began to spin what proved to twin tails, slowly at first, then
<br />
faster, until he rose in the air.  He lifted himself to a rooftop,
<br />
donned the cloak again, and then began to run and leap from roof to
<br />
roof, until he found the abandoned garret he called home.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails!&quot; cried a younger child, a small kitten.  &quot;You found
<br />
anything today?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milos, the street-thief more commonly known in the gutters and
<br />
alleyways as &quot;Tails&quot;, opened the pouch, grinning.  &quot;Oh, not much...
<br />
just a few coppers and a SILVER piece.  We can feast tonight!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gathered children of Tails' gang gave a ragged cheer.
<br />
Poor, abandoned, and without any other form of support, the four
<br />
cubs looked upon their leader with undisguised admiration.  A
<br />
silver coin might be little to the spendthrift hedgehog, but to
<br />
five small half-starved kids it meant bread, cheese, ale (no-one
<br />
would drink the water in the City) and even some sausages or cold
<br />
meats.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where did you get it?&quot;  asked another.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He stole it, you doof,&quot; retorted the oldest of the four, a
<br />
rather sour-looking ferret.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know that,&quot; replied the rabbit-child.  &quot;But where?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The kitten and the youngest-- a five- year old skunk-- gazed
<br />
at their leader in awe, as he replied, &quot;Oh, just some wandering
<br />
barbarian... huge one, with a honking great axe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow.  Weren't you scared?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot; Maybe a little... not of him, of course.  But he WAS walking
<br />
with ol' Cap'n Rabbot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ferret's usual expression of sour boredom loosened a bit
<br />
at that.  &quot;You mean you filched it with Rabbot there?  That's awful
<br />
dangerous, ain't it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe...  but she's not likely to catch me.  And that
<br />
barbarian was so city-struck I could've grabbed that axe, and his
<br />
tunic, and likely his underwear and he still wouldn't have
<br />
noticed.&quot;  Tails grinned, and then laughed.  &quot;Besides, even if he
<br />
had, he'd never have caught me.  He's a hedgehog.  And you know how
<br />
slow they are.&quot;
<br />
