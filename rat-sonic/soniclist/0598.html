<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Saaaaaallyyy!&quot; called Tails, as he flew over to her hut.  &quot;Aunt Sally,&quot;
<br />
he called again, knocking on the door.  No answer.  &quot;Sally?&quot; he asked, slowly
<br />
opening the door.  Nobody was home.  &quot;Too late!&quot; he thought and quickly
<br />
headed off toward the War Room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The War Room was not much more than another hut.  It got it's name after
<br />
Sir Charles build a holographic projector to use as a visual aid for planning
<br />
raids, rescues, or other missions to Robotropolis.  Everybody met in the War
<br />
Room before a planned mission to work out the details.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally?&quot; Tails asked again, this time at the front steps of the War Room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails?&quot; answered Princess Sally, opening the door.  &quot;What are you doing
<br />
here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wanna go on the mission too!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think so, Tails.  Not this one, anyway.  It's too dangerous.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But I can handle it!  I'm a freedom fighter now, remember?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was true.  Tails was an official freedom fighter, but everybody was
<br />
over-protective of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think he can do it,&quot; defended Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic...&quot; grumbled Sally, &quot;he's only ten years old...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But he's a way cool ten!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally pulled Sonic away from the doorway into a corner of the room.  &quot;We
<br />
can't afford to fail this mission!&quot; she said in a harsh whisper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you're saying Tails'll screw it up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No......it's just that......well...fine.  He can come.&quot;  She stepped back
<br />
into the doorway.  &quot;Okay Tails, here's what you can do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They discussed the plan and, after everybody was ready, Sonic lead the way
<br />
to the power ring generator.  He always wondered why the thing had to be
<br />
underwater, but he knew that Charles must have had his reasons.  It was still
<br />
three whole minutes before another ring appeared.  Sonic went over the
<br />
mission again.  He was deep in thought when Tails tapped him on the shoulder,
<br />
offering him the ring.  He took it and stuffed it in his backpack for later
<br />
use.  Sonic let Tails have a head start as they raced toward Robotropolis
<br />
whilst Sally rode Dulcy as they flew the aerial route.  It took less than a
<br />
minute to get to Robotropolis (Sonic was taking his time) and, not
<br />
surprisingly, he got there first.  He was at &quot;the usual&quot; which was a small,
<br />
open area surrounded by junk.  Contrary to how it sounds, it was camouflaged
<br />
quite well.  If the raiding party had to regroup for any reason, this is
<br />
where they'd meet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic scanned the skies for a while, which got old fast.  &quot;Where are
<br />
they?&quot; he thought out loud.  &quot;They should've been here by now.&quot;  And he was
<br />
right.  Ten minutes passed with quite a bit of hover units passing by.
<br />
&quot;Where ARE they?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's right behind you!&quot; alerted Sally, ducking laser fire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hang on,&quot; warned Dulcy in just enough time to be too late for Sally to
<br />
react.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dove, almost straight down, which was followed by a sharp left turn
<br />
and then a full loop.  This tactic worked, Dulcy was now behind the pursuing
<br />
Stealth-bot, but with one side effect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;AAAAAAAAAA!!!&quot; screamed Sally at the top of her lungs.  Unbeknownst to
<br />
Dulcy, Sally had fallen off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; complained Dulcy, under her breath.  &quot;Couldja' hang on a sec!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, the Stealth-bot had figured out what had happened and was turning
<br />
to continue the pursuit.  The other two were far behind.  This gave Dulcy the
<br />
opportunity to &quot;postpone&quot; her little encounter and save Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm coming!&quot; she called.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down and located Sally, who had been falling for a good four
<br />
seconds.  By now, she had fallen well over three hundred feet and in another
<br />
four seconds would have fallen eight hundred more.  However, Dulcy had
<br />
&quot;cracked the whip&quot; and caught her in little under a second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There now, that wasn't so bad.  You okay, Sally?&quot; polled Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only sound she got was a quick, soft whisper of &quot;I'm fine,&quot; from
<br />
Sally.  After Sally caught her breath, she checked for the Stealth-bots and
<br />
warned Dulcy as to where they were.  This time she was ready for any more
<br />
&quot;stunts&quot; Dulcy was going to pull.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally could feel the centrifugal force holding her in the saddle as Dulcy
<br />
pulled up and chased after one of the Stealth-bots.  Dulcy was slowly getting
<br />
closer and closer until she finally unleashed a miniature blizzard at the
<br />
Stealth-bot.  It froze instantly and dropped like a ton of bricks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One down, two to go!&quot; exclaimed Dulcy after she heard the Stealth-bot
<br />
shatter upon impact.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's one off to your left!&quot; said Sally, leaning forward so Dulcy could
<br />
hear her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Left?&quot; Dulcy thought to herself.  She had noticed the one on her right.
<br />
Then it hit her.  She made a sudden turn to her right and headed straight
<br />
toward the Stealth-bot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you doing!?!&quot; Sally screamed at her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Trust me!&quot; she replied, dodging laser fire as she went.   At the last
<br />
second, she let out a smoke screen and pulled up out of it. The two
<br />
Stealth-bots, who couldn't see a thing, crashed right into each other.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Next time,&quot; suggested Sally, &quot;tell me when you're going to play chicken
<br />
with a Stealth-bot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continued their flight to Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's Sonic,&quot; Sally pointed out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; replied Dulcy.  &quot;Here I go...&quot; she thought to herself.  &quot;I can do
<br />
this.  Just level off.  Level off...  Good.  Slow down.  Okay.  Now land.&quot;
<br />
The next thing she knew, she was lying on the ground, face down, regaining
<br />
consciousness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You okay, Dulce?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm fine, ma,&quot; was the reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where were you guys?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, we were in a dogfight,&quot; answered Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A dogfight?  With who?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A squadron of Stealth-bots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A SQUADRON?  Why was there a squadron out patrolling?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who knows.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There were a lot of hover units around,&quot; the intelligible young fox
<br />
chimed in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's right.  What's up with all the security?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe Robotnik's up to something,&quot; replied Dulcy, fully recovered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If he is, we're in trouble,&quot; Sally pointed out.  &quot;With all these patrols
<br />
around, we're going to have a hard time completing the mission.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right,&quot; confirmed Sonic.  &quot;Let's just get the 'bot and get outta here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  Dulcy, whenever you're ready.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy flew up to a ledge on one of the surrounding buildings.  After
<br />
looking around, she signaled the &quot;okay...no, wait...okay&quot; sign.  Sally jumped
<br />
into Sonic's arms and he took off with Tails close behind.  They were headed
<br />
for the Swat-bot production factory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They arrived seconds later and all followed Sally as she led the way to an
<br />
air vent.  She carefully removed the grate, put it aside, and crawled through
<br />
the small passage into the factory.  After everybody was out of the vent,
<br />
they spread out, scanning the interior.  It was a vast place, conveyor belts,
<br />
cranes, extra Swat-bot parts, yet not a single guard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is too weird,&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Agreed,&quot; came a reply from Sally at the other end of the factory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Over here.  This must be where they put the completed Swat-bots before
<br />
shipping them off to their posts and activating them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Sally was standing in front of a loading dock.  The Swat-bots
<br />
would be left there until a transport shuttle came by to pick them up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good job, Sal.  Meetchya' outside.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic dragged one of the Swat-bots back through the vent.  Dulcy was
<br />
outside waiting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here you go, Dulce.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic heaved the Swat-bot onto Dulcy's back and she took off for Knothole.
<br />
Now came the hardest part of the mission: waiting.  He waited...  And
<br />
waited...  And waited...  It seemed like hours before Sally and Tails finally
<br />
emerged from the vent.  Sally again leaped into Sonic's arms and he once more
<br />
tore off into the night to the outskirts of Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole,&quot; said Sally, &quot;detonate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The factory went up in flames.  A nice sized mushroom cloud soon followed.
<br />
Then the shock wave.  It was a spectacular light show, but all good things
<br />
must come to an end.  After it was over, the three started back toward
<br />
Knothole, content in knowing the mission was successful.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were greeted at their small village by Rotor with a disturbed look on
<br />
his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Message from Uncle Chuck,&quot; he said in a low voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does it say?&quot; Sonic wanted to know.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor handed him the message:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik is definitely up to something.  High Security.  Lots of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patrols.  Working on the details.  Watch for another message.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what could ol' 'Buttnik be doing that Uncle Chuck doesn't know
<br />
about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hard to say.  Probably something big.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At least that explains all the security,&quot; concluded Dulcy.  &quot;But let's
<br />
worry about that...&quot; she yawned, &quot;...in the morning.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group dispersed, each member heading of to his or her hut--except
<br />
Rotor.  He stayed up late in his lab, working on the Swat-bot.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!&quot; Doctor Robotnik contacted him via hologram.  &quot;Have you finished
<br />
your interrogation?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively was in a small, enclosed room with a single chair in the center
<br />
and a bright light aimed at it.  It was one of the many interrogation rooms
<br />
Robotnik had created.  There were six Swat-bots assisting him, two guarding
<br />
the door, three guarding the prisoner, and one off in a corner.  Robotnik
<br />
does not usually have this many guards assigned to a single prisoner.  Even
<br />
if a few of the prisoners did escape, where would they go?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively gasped.  &quot;Well...uh...no, sir.  Not yet,&quot; answered Snively.  &quot;He
<br />
refuses to talk, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Loosing your touch?&quot;  Robotnik thought back to when Commander Packbell
<br />
arrived with the prisoners and wondered why he let Snively do the
<br />
interrogating.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, sir...it's just that...well, sir, we can't kill him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then roboticize him, fool!  His secrets will be ours!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes--&quot; the hologram was gone, &quot;--sir,&quot; Snively mumbled to himself.  &quot;Then
<br />
roboticize him, fool!  Hmph!  I'll show you roboticizing!&quot;  He stormed off
<br />
down the hall.  &quot;Bring the prisoner!&quot; he called behind him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three Swat-bots guarding the prisoner escorted him to the door with
<br />
the Swat-bot in the corner leading the way, obviously designated as the
<br />
unofficial leader.  The other two at the door waited until everybody had left
<br />
before bringing up the rear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think so,&quot; the prisoner announced.  &quot;Computer, retrieve all data
<br />
from the Swat-bots, then delete all their data.&quot;  All the Swat-bots suddenly
<br />
fell flat on their faces.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively heard the noise and spun around to find the prisoner escaping.
<br />
&quot;Get back here!&quot; he demanded.  &quot;What are you waiting for!?!&quot; he yelled at the
<br />
Swat-bots.  &quot;Get him!  Get him!&quot;  They did nothing.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean you LOST him!?!&quot; asked Robotnik, holding Snively up to
<br />
his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively swallowed hard.  &quot;Well, sir...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can you lose a prisoner with SIX Swat-bots as escort!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You see, sir...&quot; Snively replied with sweat pouring down his face.  &quot;All
<br />
their data is gone, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHAT!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I-I-I can't explain it, sir.  All data in the Swat-bots was deleted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's IMPOSSIBLE!!!&quot; Robotnik said, throwing Snively back on the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Find him, Snively!  He cannot get away!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y-Y-Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Snively left to assemble his search party, Robotnik walked back to
<br />
his chair and sat down.  He pressed a button, &quot;Packbell!&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds later a hologram appeared before him.  &quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Packbell
<br />
awaited orders.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever you're doing can wait!&quot;
<br />
