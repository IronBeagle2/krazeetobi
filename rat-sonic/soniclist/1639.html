<br />

<br />
Timeline:  One day before Doomsday.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
A pure, green-pigmented plain placed upon the northern continent on Mobius.
<br />
Some dried leaves fluttered in the gentle breeze, warmed by the noonday
<br />
sun.  Birds sung the ancient melody of the world, and a few non-evolved 
<br />
rabbits hopped through the shorter grass.  It was a scene beautiful enough to
<br />
melt even the most jaded heart; for on this world, scenes like that might
<br />
become rare...  
<br />

<br />
In the middle of this scene, barely visible in the high grass, was a 3 foot
<br />
tall hedgehog.  But this was not one of the usual variety of bipedal
<br />
hedgehog.  Nor was this particular hedgehog even a child of this
<br />
world; rather, he was a misplaced, genetically scrambled member of a dead
<br />
planet millions of light years from the spot where he now laid, calmly
<br />
enjoying the beauty of his new home.  This was the lot of Joseph, the
<br />
descendant of two DNA helii; his natural, Ur'thaen brand, and the current
<br />
Mobian hedgehog variety which he was experiencing now.  
<br />

<br />
However, his genetic identity crisis didn't appear to be bothering him now,
<br />
as he silently laid in the sun, soaking in the yellow star's warming rays.
<br />
The wind drifted over his motionless form as if it was a mother's gentle
<br />
movement, tucking him in for a night's rest.  A butterfly alighted on one
<br />
of his longer headquills, and slowly came to peacefully rest there.
<br />

<br />
This was paradise, Joseph thought, as he continued to simply lay there and
<br />
revel in the sublime beauty of Mobius.  He wondered why Robotnik would wish
<br />
anything like this harm.  Had he never simply walked outside on a glorious
<br />
day as this, sat down in a field, and merely admired the handiwork of
<br />
Nature?  Was all of his destruction merely due to him being a homish sort?
<br />

<br />
Nay, he pondered, Robotnik had been out in the wilderness.  He'd sit in a
<br />
field like this, take a deep breath, and think...how he'd first cut
<br />
down those trees to create housing, then drill holes in the earth for oil,
<br />
then ponder mining for precious metals...no, Robotnik could simply not
<br />
appreciate nature.  It was simply not his to appreciate this one.  Probably
<br />
all those simian genes.
<br />

<br />
But Joseph let those unpleasant thoughts leave him.  He didn't want to
<br />
think about Robotnik or Robotropolis or the damned pirated Ur'thaen 
<br />
roboticizer now.  That would only impede intuitive thought of solutions to
<br />
those problems.  Alas, he had only allotted himself only a few more days of
<br />
being au naturale before returning to Knothole and resuming work on the
<br />
deroboticization process.  He needed to value this vacation time as a
<br />
period to let his strained mind adjust to the myriad of changes that had
<br />
affected him; landing on a foreign world, finding out that he was not the
<br />
first of his kind to land here, being mutated...it made his head spin to
<br />
ponder all that had occured in only a few months.
<br />

<br />
However, Joseph realized that looking backward would only impede his
<br />
progress.  He had to overcome the obstacles placed in his path, and
<br />
continue on.  He had people to help now, so brooding wasn't going to do any
<br />
good.
<br />

<br />
But he wasn't going to think about that anymore.  No, this was a vacation,
<br />
and Joseph knew that thinking about work would only slow it down in the
<br />
long run.  So, he laid there in the field, took a deep breath, and
<br />
continued staring into the sky.  After a moment, he felt much better about
<br />
his situation again.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, a different sort of conteplation was occuring an a craft
<br />
speeding away from Robotropolis.  The sole passenger of the craft was
<br />
pondering what to say to his new friend to get him to return with him
<br />
this time.  He had still been reluctant to leave his precious island the last
<br />
time he had visited him, but he knew that he could convince him to return
<br />
with him today...
<br />

<br />
Laughter echoed through the small craft as it sped further away from the
<br />
dark outline of Robotropolis.  Soon, the short human thought, soon,
<br />
Robotnik would be out of the way; and then he, Snively the Great, could
<br />
take his rightful control over Mobius!
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Eventually, Joseph grew tired of just laying in the field, thinking about
<br />
nothing.  If it's one thing his new body demanded, it was activity.  So,
<br />
he chose to get back to the activity that he had engaged in for most of
<br />
his vacation; exploring Mobius.
<br />

<br />
He had searched most of the Southern continent last week, and the Northern
<br />
continent was already throughly charted.  Perhaps he would visit the
<br />
sea again.  It was certainly beautiful enough to warrant a second look.
<br />
Besides, he had a yearning for seafood.  A boiled lobster about then seemed
<br />
mighty good.  He licked his lips and stood up.
<br />

<br />
He hadn't yet mastered the whole powering-up thing with his running.  He
<br />
always seemed to mess something up.  He'd either fall on his head, slip on
<br />
something and fall backwards, or lose control entirely and fly into a tree.
<br />
So, with some trepidation, he started running in place like Sonic did,
<br />
slowly picking up speed at first, but quickly picking up speed.  After
<br />
a few seconds of this, he took his foot off the clutch (so to speak)
<br />
and blasted forward.  
<br />

<br />
Surprisingly, he was able to maintain control of his propultion well enough
<br />
to direct himself to the shore.  Within minutes, he was able to see the
<br />
line of the horizon reflecting off the sea.  Now, he had to stop.  He
<br />
didn't particularly *like* stopping.  He had never been able to cease his
<br />
propultion on a 1 Mobian coin like Sonic did.  He had always gone up some 
<br />
extreme surface without speeding up to come to a halt.  The water was now
<br />
in plain sight.  It looked awfully blue today.  He wondered how deep--
<br />

<br />
Unconsciously speeding up, he sucessfully breached the coast, and was
<br />
suddenly running over the water.  Whoa, Joseph thought, this is cool!
<br />
He ran straight off the coast for a few minutes, and then tried a left
<br />
turn.  After sucessfully turning left, he tried turning right.  This also
<br />
was accomplished easily.  Deciding to put his navigation skills to the
<br />
test, he ran in a figure-8 a few times, and then shot off in a different
<br />
direction.  Way Past Cool, he mentally snickered, and headed off further
<br />
off the coast.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The small craft landed on the far side of an anonymous island somewhere in
<br />
the Great Ocean.  Snively departed the craft, told the SWAT Bot pilot to
<br />
maintain a holding pattern, and walked away.  As the craft took off, Snively
<br />
disappeared into the island's jungle-like foilage.
<br />

<br />
After walking on a roughly-beaten path for a while, he came to a clearing
<br />
that he had visited countless times before.  And, like every time, he 
<br />
walked over to a small stump, took a seat upon it, and waited for his
<br />
host to appear.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Welcome, Snively-mon,&quot; a voice said, &quot;back to my island.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Knuckles, cut the dramatics.&quot;  Snively looked around.  &quot;Just tell me 
<br />
your answer.  Will you return to Robotropolis with me, or not?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Some leaves rustled behind Snively, and a red-quilled figure appeared.
<br />
&quot;I tol' you, mon, I canno' leave dis island.  I gotta guard my Ruby.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Echidna,&quot; Snively falsely smiled, &quot;there is no one left on Mobius with the
<br />
capability to find this island but myself.  How could someone steal your
<br />
precious `Ruby' if they don't even know this alcove exists?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;But ev'ryone wants my Ruby, mon.  It's special.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Snively internally chuckled.  This foolish creature of the forest was so
<br />
paranoid about some idiotic reddish rock.  It probably was a piece of
<br />
glass, or maybe it *was* a tiny little ruby.  Either way, it was
<br />
unimportant to Snively what it was.  &quot;I told you,&quot; he said, &quot;you can take
<br />
it with you if you want.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I can' take it.  I tol' you, it don' wanna be took.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Snively sighed.  &quot;Look, I could station some robot-soldiers...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Knuckles grimaced.  &quot;No!  No robots!  Dis island shall NOT have robots
<br />
on it!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Snively recoiled.  &quot;Okay, I won't put any here.  I just thought you'd want
<br />
some protection for your stone.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Knuckles grew silent, obviously considering some things.  Snively talked as
<br />
he thought.  &quot;Look, I promise you that nothing shall happen to your `Ruby'
<br />
until you return.&quot;  Snively put his hand on the echidna's shoulder in a
<br />
false gesture of empathy.  &quot;You will return here.  I *promise*.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You promise?&quot; the echidna spouted.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes, I do.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Knuckles hmmed.  &quot;Okay, I go wit' you.  But I want one mo' day here on the
<br />
island before I go.  Dat okay?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Snively smiled.  &quot;Yes, that will be fine.&quot;  *JUST* fine, he thought, and
<br />
just in time...  &quot;I'll be back here at sundown tomorrow to pick you up.  Go
<br />
to the north shore, and a ship will come for you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
As Snively got back up, Knuckles disappeared back into the underbrush.  
<br />
The short human smiled evilly, and walked back up the path to flag down 
<br />
his vehicle.  This was too easy, he thought, as the ship landed, allowed
<br />
him to board, and rocketed back toward Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph sped over miles of water, going in no particular direction for very
<br />
long, nor really planning to go anywhere.  He thought he might eventually
<br />
circumnavigate the world if he kept at this long enough.  And, when he saw
<br />
the patch of land over on the eastern horizon, he thought he had.  He sped
<br />
curiously over to it, wondering which coast it was.
<br />

<br />
After a second or two, he was running along the coast of the land, and then
<br />
realized it was an island.  He hadn't quite circled the globe yet,
<br />
obviously, but this phenomenon still deserved investigation.  He went
<br />
ashore, and started to slow--
<br />

<br />
*BONK*
<br />

<br />
When he came to, it was nighttime, and he was staring up into a pair of
<br />
eyes.  &quot;Uhh...&quot; he groaned as a pair of hands grabbed him and pulled him to
<br />
his feet.
<br />

<br />
&quot;How did you get 'ere!?  'Ave you come to steal my Ruby?!?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Something that felt like a brick nailed him across the face, causing blood
<br />
to drip from his mouth.  &quot;I ASKED you a ques'ion, intruder!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Muggaahh...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Arrgh!  &quot;What are you, stupid?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I...don't understand...intruder?&quot;
<br />

<br />
*POW*
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph woke up a few hours later in a bamboo cage, hanging over a large
<br />
pit.  A few rails had been redded with the liquid that had poured from his
<br />
oral cavity after the figure had decked him.  (With what, he wondered, a
<br />
brick?)  In addition to that painful injury, a few more additional cuts 
<br />
had been inflicted (but healed) on parts of his stomach and arms; 
<br />
obviously caused by being dragged through some sharper underbrush.  
<br />

<br />
Struggling to his feet, he tried to regain his bearings.  He was in a dense
<br />
part of the jungle.  The cage was hanging from a single treebranch, but it
<br />
looked stable...for now.  There was solid ground closeby the pit (which he
<br />
now saw having sharp spikes at the bottom) and a single path leading away
<br />
from it deeper into the forest.
<br />

<br />
He quickly came to the decision to try and swing the cage out from over the
<br />
pit, and onto solid ground, where it would probably break open.  As he
<br />
began to rock it back and forth, he heard (as expected) the branch
<br />
beginning to go.  He rocked a little harder, and he started to hear it
<br />
crack.  He finally gave the cage a teriffic shake, and the branch broke,
<br />
plummeting it to the earth below.  The cage began falling soon after that;
<br />
it tumbled toward the ground, shattered open, and spilled its 
<br />
contents onto the forest floor.    
<br />

<br />
What Joseph had forgotten to anticipate was the pain factor involved in
<br />
being inside of a cage when it crushed into the earth.  He agonizingly
<br />
climbed out of the wreckage, picking small pieces of bamboo out of his
<br />
quills.  He was beginning to hate this place.  A lot.
<br />

<br />
After he had gotten himself together, he wandered silently down the path.
<br />
Luckily, his martial arts training had not been effected by his
<br />
transformation, so he was able to stealthily traverse the path without
<br />
distrurbing a single item in the forest.  Hopefully, he could find the
<br />
shore, rev up, and get off this island before anything bad--
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; WARNING: POWER LEVELS AT: 5% AND DROPPING.  REQUIRE REFUELLING BEFORE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DEPARTURE BACK TO DOME ALPHA.  ACQUIRE POWER CRYSTALS.  PRIORITY: ONE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PRIORITY: ONE.  PRIORITY: ONE.  PRIORITY: ONE.  PRIORITY: ONE........ &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
--happens.
<br />

<br />
He emitted a series of vile Ur'thaen curses, and snarled.  This irritated
<br />
Joseph to a great degree.  His internal power cells were supposed to last 
<br />
for about 1000 years before ever dipping below 50%, and here were his 
<br />
systems crying 5% 6 months after it had been activated.  Then, he 
<br />
realized exactly how much load he had put on his body in the last
<br />
6 months, and was able to calm his fears of his body having leaky fuel 
<br />
cells.  
<br />

<br />
But, it still left the problem of finding fuel.  He was going to have
<br />
difficulty finding something digestible without having to confront whatever
<br />
it was that struck at him.  It was about as strong as he was at this point,
<br />
and certainly didn't like him very much...he thought Joe wanted to steal
<br />
his `Ruby', whatever the hell that was.  
<br />

<br />
So, he did some quick internal calculations.  If he went at a normal speed,
<br />
didn't use his augmented strength much, and avoided further injury, he
<br />
could last about a year on the island.  After all, the food looked edible,
<br />
and the water was fairly clean...but he didn't want to be here a year.  He
<br />
didn't want to be there a day!  He wanted to go home.  
<br />

<br />
He pounded his fist against his hand.  No, there had to be crystals on this
<br />
island.  There were crystals everywhere on this planet!  All he had to do
<br />
was look.  He turned his optical scanners to detect energy signatures, and
<br />
went off to find some.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
At daybreak, Joseph reached the shore.  He had covered half the island, and
<br />
he was down to about 4% of his total energy.  So far, he hadn't detected
<br />
much of anything.  Some small pebbles were all that carried any sort of
<br />
juice in them, but they had not enough to even make a spark.
<br />

<br />
The sun beamed down upon Joseph, trying ineffectually to give him some
<br />
solar energy.  Alas, but he had no solar panels on him, and no means to
<br />
make any.  It did, however, warm him up enough so he physically felt
<br />
better, and made him think to sweep the horizon and admire the view.  
<br />
As he looked around, he noticed a small, craft-shape energy
<br />
imprint upon the ground.  He walked over to it to examine it further.
<br />
A ship had landed there earlier, no more than a day ago, and quickly had
<br />
taken off again.  (He could understand why someone would do that.)
<br />

<br />
However, it appeared that it was a Robotropolis-brand ship that had landed
<br />
there, by the blackish residue that was left on the ground.  Had someone
<br />
else decided to take a holiday here?  He hadn't seen anyone else but the
<br />
figure that attacked him...but Robotnik wasn't into bamboo, he thought.
<br />

<br />
This was becoming a really strange situation, Joseph pondered, as he
<br />
wandered toward the other side of the island.  Mysterious guardians of
<br />
unknown jewels, unknown landings of Robotnik-made crafts...it was all
<br />
connected somehow, but Joe couldn't see it.  He started walking down a path
<br />
that led through the other side of the island.  He began to mull over
<br />
exactly what could be so important that whoever was guarding it would
<br />
savagely beat whomever seemed to threaten it...
<br />

<br />
Then, a blip appeared in front of him.  A large crystal vein was on this
<br />
side of the island, toward the center.  He smiled.  His ticket home was
<br />
right on the beaten path.  Perhaps this is what the strange one was
<br />
guarding, Joe thought.  Well, he won't mind if I take a few off his hands
<br />
for lunch now, would he?
<br />

<br />
He wasn't going to take any chances either way.  He returned to his
<br />
stealthy mode of walking, and seemed to disappear into the underbrush.
<br />
Within a few hours, he was in the center of the island.
<br />

<br />
He was on the very edge of the clearing.  A cave was directly in front of
<br />
him, giving off an reddish glow deep inside of it.  This is what the person
<br />
who had attacked him was guarding.  &quot;I wonder what's inside of it,&quot; Joseph
<br />
whispered aloud.
<br />

<br />
&quot;My Ruby's inside o' dere.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He didn't turn around.  He *knew* what would happen if he turned around.
<br />
So, he just burst forward toward the cave.  &quot;GET BACK 'ERE!!!&quot; shouted the
<br />
figure as Joseph hit the sound barrier halfway through the cave.  
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; WARNING: POWER LEVELS AT: 2% AND DROPPING &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
He got to the back of the cave, no longer caring whether or not that person
<br />
liked him or not.  When he got to the inside of the cave, he pushed a large
<br />
boulder in front of the opening out, so that the individual trying to kill
<br />
him would at least be slowed down.  He heard thumping on the rock, and
<br />
muffled shouting, but he had not broken it down enough to get
<br />
through...yet.  Having that out of the way, he ran as fast as was 
<br />
prudent to the back of the cave.  
<br />

<br />
He was stuck dumb with awe when he entered the area where the light was
<br />
coming from.  The walls of the domed area were covered in glowing, sparking
<br />
energy crystal.  In the center of the room, there was an energy core that
<br />
was being powered by a reddish rock...his `Ruby', obviously.  But why did 
<br />
this undeveloped island need this much power?  What was this `Ruby' really?
<br />
He took a closer look at it, and accessed his records of Mobian geological
<br />
history.  No, he thought, it couldn't be.  But it *had* to be.  
<br />

<br />
This `Ruby' was actually a Chaos Emerald.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
This explained a lot, thought Joseph.  Chaos Emeralds were mythical, 
<br />
mystical power crystals that are capable of generating extreme amounts of
<br />
clean, emissionless energy.  They were also said to have special powers of
<br />
their own, depending on their color.  But this was unimportant to Joseph
<br />
right now.  All he knew was that the red rock in the center of the room was
<br />
best left where it was.  It was probably incompatible with his digestive 
<br />
system, anyway.  So, instead of attempting to acquire that particular
<br />
crystalline morsel, he started trying to break off bits of the more 
<br />
digestible power crystal on the walls.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the boulder in the front of the cave suddenly formed a large 
<br />
crack in the center of it, and seconds later it crumbled to the ground.
<br />
A very pissed-off Knuckles then strode in, looking to beat the tar out of
<br />
the `thief' inside by his delicate `Ruby'.
<br />

<br />
Joseph was too busy trying to chip off a mouth-sized crystal off the wall
<br />
to notice the boulder crumbling to dust in back of him.  He hoped that if
<br />
he ate this one it would be enough to keep him going long enough to get
<br />
back home.  
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, he never got a chance to find out.  Knuckles swiftly went
<br />
into a flying tackle onto the weakened and bleeding hedgehog, knocking 
<br />
the crystal out of his hand.  It flew across the room and shattered on 
<br />
the wall, directly next to Joseph's hope of leaving here peacefully.   
<br />
He was then slammed against the wall and kicked in the back.  He yelped as
<br />
he felt a quill snap off one of his lower rows and scatter onto the floor.
<br />

<br />
Being driven to even more savagery by Joseph's acknoledgement of his abuse,
<br />
he punched Joseph repeatedly in the face, yelling on each impact.  &quot;STAY!&quot; 
<br />
*POW*  &quot;'WAY!&quot;  *SOCK*  &quot;FROM!&quot;  *BAMF*  &quot;MY!&quot;  *WHACK*  &quot;RUBY!!!&quot;  *CRACK*
<br />
By the time &quot;FROM!&quot; had rang out, Joseph had begun to go somewhat blind,
<br />
and his eyes freely bled blackish fluid.  He coughed up a few mouthfuls of
<br />
bloods after the 5th or 6th sucessive hit, giving Knuckles a sense of great
<br />
personal pride.  But, he grew tired of this, and decided to switch from his
<br />
face to some other part.  Making a split-second decision, he threw him to 
<br />
the ground and started kicking Joe in the stomach.  Joseph was blinded 
<br />
completely, and was beginning to lose his sense of hearing.  All that was 
<br />
left to his sensors was the pain.  
<br />

<br />
After a few more kicks, Knuckles grabbed him by the throat, pushed his face
<br />
inside the engine core, burning a centimeter or two off of it.  Joseph
<br />
tried to scream; but the echidna closed his fist around his throat, choking
<br />
his howl to a squeak.  &quot;You betta take a nice, GOOD look at my Ruby,
<br />
'cuz it's the LAST thing you're EVER gonna see!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; WARNING!  WARNING!  CRITICAL DAMAGE LEVELS!  WARNING!  WARNING! &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
He weakly struggled to break the echidna's grip, but he barely had enough
<br />
power to writhe around in agony.  He got a few good kicks in around
<br />
Knuckles' midsection, but nothing that could make him let go of him long
<br />
enough to let him breathe...
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; WARNING!  WARNING!  ENERGY LEVELS CRITICAL!  WARNING!  WARNING! &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
He felt like he was gagging on his own pancreas.  He knew his eyeballs were
<br />
about to pop out from the pressure, and his mind was beginning to go...
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IN 10 SECONDS &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
He clawed at Knuckles' quills, but only managed to prick himself in the
<br />
fingers.  He kicked and swung his arms, but Knuckles knew he was almost
<br />
dead....  
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE IN 5 SECONDS &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
No!  Not again!  Not before I--
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; SYSTEM SHUTDOWN &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
For Joseph, time stopped.  He lost all memory of his life, his world, his
<br />
entire existance.  The struggling ceased; the static died down to silence, 
<br />
his sensors stopped recieving information...the world grew cold, spun, 
<br />
and slowly faded to black...
<br />

<br />
But then, a miracle occured.
<br />

<br />
Actually, a biological miracle occured.  His body used the remaining volts
<br />
of his internal power to mutate his tongue into an energy reciever.  Then,
<br />
running on sheer exhaust fumes, it gave it just enough length to wrap
<br />
itself around the crystal, and shot it out to try to siphon off as much
<br />
energy as it could.
<br />

<br />
It got far, far more than it bargained for.  In fact, it got more than
<br />
enough.  Immediately, ruby-red energy carressed Joseph's limp form,
<br />
catapaulting Knuckles across the room and out of the cave.  Slowly,
<br />
Joseph's energy levels went up, slightly dimming the crystal's light.
<br />

<br />
However, as Joseph was recharging, the island was beginning to sink.  
<br />
The beaches slowly started to retreat under a blue wall of water.  Small 
<br />
animals desperately ascended trees, rocks, anything they could find in 
<br />
order to avoid being drowned.
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; ENERGY LEVELS RISING.  10%.  20%.  30%.  40%.  50%.  60%.... &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
After a few moments, Joseph's power levels were back to 100%.  As he
<br />
disengaged his tongue from the crystal, and returned it to a normal length,
<br />
his healing systems came back on-line, and started to repair the damage
<br />
that had been done.  He barely noticed the small earthquake that occured
<br />
after he fell from the crystal, nor did he care what it meant.  He just 
<br />
wanted to repair his screaming shell of a body.
<br />

<br />
He slowly rubbed against the energy crystal-covered wall.  He was too
<br />
exhausted to even move.  He doubted he was going to be able to go anywhere
<br />
for 15 minutes or so as he renewed hiself.  The creature had beat him up
<br />
pretty bad.  His vision was just coming back, and his hearing was still
<br />
fuzzy.  Not only that, it seemed like his entire body core hurt.  
<br />

<br />
He coughed up some blood and spat it onto a nearby rock.  It hissed,
<br />
bubbled, and ate right through it.  He was relieved.  He wasn't internally
<br />
bleeding anymore; or else the clotting agents would have neutralized the
<br />
blood's acidic effects.  
<br />

<br />
His sight clarified seconds later.  That was much better.  Checking his
<br />
power levels, he was somewhat discouraged...it was eating up most of his
<br />
power.  He'd be back to 50% after all the repairs were complete.  But
<br />
that'd be enough to finish his host off...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Knuckles was laying unconscious in a clearing about 1000 yards from the
<br />
cave.  The charge had knocked him clear through the forest, and he was cut
<br />
up pretty bad.  Of course, he didn't notice this, because he was in a
<br />
stupor, but it still appeared awfully painful.  His gloves were also
<br />
somewhat singed, but they were at least not on fire any longer.
<br />

<br />
He began to come out of it.  Shaking his head, he groaned at the amount of
<br />
damage the hedgehog had done to him.  Ruby had shocked both of them pretty
<br />
good.  Hopefully, the stupid orange hedgehog thief was dead, and nobody
<br />
would bother Ruby until he got back.  He hated trespassers.
<br />

<br />
He stood back up.  Ruby was still there, by the glowing that came from the
<br />
cave.  But he had to be sure the hedgehog was dead.  Had to.  Could be
<br />
alive, FAKING dead.  He wandered back into the cave, and slowly returned to
<br />
the crystal room.
<br />

<br />
Joseph was there, acting dead.  Since he didn't have any pupils to dilate,
<br />
he simply gave off a pheromone that denoted deadness.  Hopefully, the
<br />
echidna would smell it, and think him demised.
<br />

<br />
Knuckles entered.  He looked over at the puddles of blood laying around,
<br />
seeping into the ground.  The hedgehog bled a lot.  Dirty hedgehog.  Bad
<br />
hedgehog.  He looked at the dead hedgehog.  Good.  His instincts told him
<br />
he was dead, so he had to be.  He decided he didn't like the dead hedgehog
<br />
with Ruby, making the place smell bad.  So, he grabbed him by the
<br />
shoulders, and pulled him out of the cave.
<br />

<br />
The sun was beginning to set, so Knuckles hurried along, dragging the
<br />
hedgehog through the dirt.  He'd leave him outside the cave as a warning.
<br />
Nobody would go into a cave where a dead animal laid outside.  Just the way
<br />
it was.  He dropped him in front of the cave, right in the center of the 
<br />
enterance.  Thinking no more of it, he turned his back on the `dead'
<br />
hedgehog, and started to walk up the trail.
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; REPAIRS COMPLETE &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
Joseph stood up, and ran over to Knuckles as silently as the wind.  He
<br />
grabbed the naive echidna by the throat.  &quot;Miss me?&quot; he whispered into his
<br />
ear, and threw him into a tree.  A few teeth fell out of Knuckles' mouth,
<br />
accompanied by a few droplets of blood.  Smiling psychotically, Joseph 
<br />
peeled him off the tree and spiked him on the ground.  &quot;So...&quot;  He punched
<br />
him in the snout.  &quot;You *actually* think--&quot;  He fit his left ear, making it
<br />
squirt most reddish fluid.  &quot;--you can go around beating--&quot; He kicked him 
<br />
in the head.  &quot;--people--&quot; He stomped on his abdomen.  &quot;--up?&quot;  He threw 
<br />
him down the path.  &quot;Huh?&quot;  Knuckles stumbled toward the beach, trying to
<br />
escape the enraged hedgehog.  He pursued Knuckles, anxious to pummel 
<br />
him some more.
<br />

<br />
Knuckles ran toward the beach.  Bad hedgehog not dead!  Got strong from
<br />
Ruby!  Now was angry at Knuckles for stopping him from stealing Ruby.  
<br />
Help!  Help!  Snively would help.  Snively powerful.  Has powerful
<br />
machines.  Lazers that blow things up.
<br />

<br />
Joseph relentlessly chased his attacker.  He was going to be sure he was
<br />
throughly punished for beating him up when he was defenseless, and without
<br />
provocation.  He didn't want to kill him, mind you--he was not a
<br />
overzealous member of the warrior caste--just rough him up enough to teach
<br />
him to be more tolorant.  
<br />

<br />
Knuckles stood on the north shore nervously.  He looked back toward the
<br />
path, and saw the outline of the hedgehog coming close.  He looked to the
<br />
horizon, and just then saw the shadow of a single ship...Snively's ship!
<br />
He'd save him!  He'd blast the bad hedgehog into dust.  Teach him a lesson.
<br />

<br />
He saw Knuckles standing on the beach, and noticed the small craft fly
<br />
down, pick him up, and go back into the air.  &quot;Oh, no you don't,&quot; Joseph
<br />
said, and projected some energy at the ship.  It locked onto him and shot
<br />
some beams back.  He ran along the shore, trying to trick the ship into
<br />
dropping down low enough so he could get a clear shot in.  Unfortunately,
<br />
it did not.  
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, while the SWAT Bots were firing at Joseph, Knuckles was trying
<br />
to tell Snively what had happened.  He ignored most of the foolish babble
<br />
about `Ruby', of course, but realized he'd have to kill this fast,
<br />
nigh-invincible (hmm) hedgehog before Knuckles was going to leave.  
<br />
Knuckles, of course, had an idea...
<br />

<br />
Joseph had now almost ran a total circuit around the island.  He was
<br />
wondering how he was going to escape their fire, and not let them get the
<br />
Chaos Emerald at the same time.  But then, Knuckles jumped out of the
<br />
craft, and (instead of running at him) ran back toward the cave. 
<br />
Hopefully, he'd find some way of hiding it, or destroying it.  He thought
<br />
no more of the odd occurance, and continued dodging the fire of the SWAT
<br />
Bots.  
<br />

<br />
He ran beneath a series of cliffs, trying to dodge the continual bursts of
<br />
plasma.  However, he neglected to notice the large boulder directly above
<br />
him, and hid there from the ship.  It apparently didn't see him...but
<br />
Knuckles did.
<br />

<br />
He had ran around in front of the cave, taken a path to the other side of
<br />
the island, and climbed up the cliff where the boulder was.  Then, he had
<br />
gotten a piece of wood, lodged it under the rock, and was waiting for the
<br />
hedgehog to get in position....NOW!
<br />

<br />
The boulder, after being dislodged from its resting place, raced down to
<br />
the ground, making hardly a sound.  When Joseph finally noticed it, it was
<br />
too late.  It slammed into him, and shoved him deep within the moist 
<br />
earth.  
<br />

<br />
Knuckles, of course, *knew* this had to have killed him.  He cheered, did a
<br />
victory dance, and rapelled down the cliff.  He then stumbled out to the
<br />
ship, and hopped in.  Seconds later, they were both gone.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
An hour passed.  The rock didn't move.  A small puddle of blood was forming
<br />
next to it, and it was beginning to attract various insects.  The tide came
<br />
in, and started to wash softly against the rock, cleansing the earth of the
<br />
reddish pool.  The occasional bubble began to hiss up from the wet crater,
<br />
making it sound like a boiling mud pool, but instead of mud, there was
<br />
hemoglobin.  It looked like some sort of macabre metorite had crashed.
<br />

<br />
Then, as if a geyser was forcing it away, the rock split in half, and
<br />
Joseph crawled out of the hole, vomiting up sand and dirt.  He felt
<br />
absolutely miserable.  It had taken him what seemed like aeons to charge up
<br />
anouther energy in his index fingers (the only part that was touching the
<br />
rock after it pushed him 2 3/4 feet underground) to start cutting the rock,
<br />
and it had drained him down to 25% again.  
<br />

<br />
This *sucked*.
<br />

<br />
He had been beaten, electrocuted, buried, crushed, burned, nearly drowned,
<br />
and shot at.  His energy levels had gone from 100% to 1% to 50% to 25%.
<br />
It felt like a really nasty form of vixen PMS.  He just wanted to charge
<br />
up, teleport home, and not leave the dome for 2 weeks.  
<br />

<br />
As he continued to wash himself off, he began to realize how fortunate it
<br />
was to be able to teleport home.  Sure, he'd have to get fully charged,
<br />
have to pretty high up, and his broadcasting array on his body wasn't 
<br />
the best, but it'd be just enough to tell Bahb to teleport him home to 
<br />
his own power charger.  He made a mental note never, never, never EVER to
<br />
take another vacation the rest of his life.  At least not without a plasma 
<br />
shotgun.  Man, he could have used one of those.  
<br />

<br />
He wandered back up the path to the cave.  The interior of the forest
<br />
looked like it had seen a world war.  Trees were bent over, there was blood
<br />
everywhere, and nothing dared move.  He grumbled.  He had lost control, and
<br />
messed up this entire ecosystem for everyone.  Good one, moron.  Hopefully,
<br />
it'd heal itself in 5 years or so, with luck.  It would look a little
<br />
better, anyway.
<br />

<br />
Approaching the cave, it didn't look much better.  He'd really beaten the
<br />
tar out of that echidna here.  Little red quills were sticking out of the
<br />
dirt like a bad hair weave.  A few teeth were also intermixed with the
<br />
quills, giving the whole area the stink of death.  It made him sick.
<br />

<br />
He wandered into the cave, which didn't look as bad.  It was only *his*
<br />
blood in here, and the crystals on the walls were vaporizing it pretty
<br />
quickly.  He went over to the Chaos Emerald, placed his hands around it,
<br />
and boosted his power back to 100%.  A few repairs and a minor earthquake
<br />
later (possibly caused by the Emerald's draining) pursued later, he charged
<br />
himself again.  Now he was back to where he was supposed to be.  He hoped
<br />
he wouldn't have to do that again for a long time.
<br />

<br />
A few minutes later, he had left the cave and ascended the cliff where the
<br />
boulder was.  Looking down, he realized that it had to have nailed him
<br />
really freakin' hard.  The cracks in the mud looked like something you'd
<br />
see on one of the three moons of this planet.  A complete wreck.  Thank
<br />
goodness it had happened in an out-of-the-way place, or else the entire
<br />
island would look like a war zone.
<br />

<br />
He pointed his eyes to the rising moons.  He calculated his exact location
<br />
in relation to Knothole, triangulated the angle of the moonbounce, and
<br />
transmitted an encrypted transporter call, with full coordinates, to his
<br />
teleporter in his lab.
<br />

<br />
The transmission shot to the 1st moon, bounced off of it at a 34 degree
<br />
angle, and refracted to the secret reciever unit by the original crash
<br />
site.  It traveled from there by buried wire 1 mile down into the earth,
<br />
went back up the hyperfast eribrum-doped fiberobtic backbone Joseph had
<br />
strung down into the earth, and back into the dome.
<br />

<br />
Bahb intercepted the transmission, decrypted it, and sent it down to the
<br />
3rd level of the Dome, the laboratory.  The automatic servos began pumping,
<br />
and the teleporter powered up.
<br />

<br />
Joseph was then surrounded by an opaque bubble, which lifted into the air
<br />
momentarily and popped, leaving no trace of either bubble or passenger.  
<br />
With that, Joseph left the Floating Island...a wreck.  
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
A second or two later, he rematerialized, looking like a refugee, in the
<br />
3rd SubBasement of his home.  Ahh.  Home sweet home.  He'd never want to
<br />
leave it again.  
<br />

<br />
He didn't even acknoledge the computer.  He hopped on the minielevator pad
<br />
and went straight to the 1st level, his bedroom.  Then, he plowed right
<br />
into the bathroom, showered, dried off, walked back into the bedroom, laid
<br />
down on the bed, and passed out.  
<br />

<br />
He slept for 5 days.
<br />

<br />

<br />
But what of Knuckles and Snively?
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
&quot;Here,&quot; Snively said, &quot;put this on your face.  It'll heal it faster.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Knuckles could only moan quietly.  He hurt.  &quot;Muhguh.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, stop complaining.  You'll be fully healed by the time we enter
<br />
Robotropolis.  By now, Robotnik should be throughly crushed by the
<br />
hedgehog.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Before Knuckles could groan something, Snively said, &quot;No, it wasn't that
<br />
one.  The one I talk about is blue.  Don't worry, you'll get to 
<br />
meet him...&quot; He smiled evilly.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I promise.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
About 5 days later, Joseph woke back up.  He mumbled as he stumbled out of
<br />
bed and gave himself yet another through scrubbing.  He still felt echidna
<br />
quills sticking out of his back.  Not only that, he'd slept for a really
<br />
long time, according to his internal chronometer.  He'd probably needed it.
<br />
Alas, he was going to have to mine some crystal pretty soon, because he
<br />
knew his energy levels weren't going to be constant for long...
<br />

<br />
He got himself back to a tolorable state and went back to the surface of
<br />
his home.  The Dome looked especially lovely today.  Bahb had made sure the
<br />
windows had stayed especially clean, and the light streamed in with
<br />
impunity.  The entire room was warm with the power of the sun.  It made him
<br />
feel much better about himself, and far more vibrant--
<br />

<br />
He got an idea.  Solar energy!  Of course!  The entire Dome was almost a
<br />
perfect focusing tool; it was a massive upside down lens.  All he had to do
<br />
was to install another lens in the reverse direction in front of his
<br />
skylight, and he could focus the rays of the sun into an extremely
<br />
high-frequency energy beam.  Then, he could create some sort of battery to
<br />
store it, and get recharged off of the light of the Mobian sun.  Just like
<br />
how he powered the rest of the house!  And he wouldn't have to take any
<br />
more of the house's energy to do it.
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he set to work on drawing up the plans for the new device,
<br />
wondering what else he could use the excess energy for....
