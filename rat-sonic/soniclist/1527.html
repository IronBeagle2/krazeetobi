&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The day's activities had been routine.  The children had
<br />
either awakened before dawn on their own or else were gotten out
<br />
of bed by Rosie.  They slept two to a hut: Sally and Bunnie in
<br />
one hut, Antoine and Rotor in another, and Sonic and Tails (by
<br />
mutual insistence) in a third.  Rosie and Julayla knew that, when
<br />
the children were a little bit older and stronger -- probably in
<br />
the coming spring -- work would have to begin on additional huts to
<br />
encourage independent living and to prevent personality clashes. 
<br />
Rotor was especially eager to set up housekeeping on his own,
<br />
though the fastidious Antoine would have balked at the use of the
<br />
word &quot;housekeeping&quot; in the same sentence as Rotor's name.  It
<br />
seemed the one thing of which Rotor was incapable.  Spare parts and
<br />
unrecognizable electronic components littered his half of the hut
<br />
and drove Antoine to distraction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children then went to have breakfast in the largest of
<br />
the huts in Knothole: a general purpose building that served as
<br />
both a mess hall and a classroom.  Bunnie tended to arrive last,
<br />
usually because she couldn't decide which color ribbons to use to
<br />
do up her ears.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the breakfast dishes were cleared away, it was time
<br />
for the children's schooling.  At ten years of age, they were
<br />
literate enough in the Mobian language, except for Antoine,
<br />
though his grasp of the planet's history was almost as complete
<br />
as Sally's.  Sally and Rotor were more adept at mathematics than
<br />
the others, and there was no question that Rotor outshone the
<br />
others in mechanics.  Bunnie worked to keep up with the others,
<br />
finding botany to be her easiest subject.  Sonic tended to lose
<br />
interest in just about everything after the first hour of
<br />
instruction.  Though Tails would spend some time in the classroom
<br />
in the mornings, he was basically playing school.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time noon rolled around, Julayla would signal the end
<br />
of class.  From there, the children would tend to their chores,
<br />
for Knothole still required a fair amount of maintenance.  The
<br />
huts and the bridge across the river had to be maintained, and
<br />
that meant carpentry.  Rotor was able to fashion tools for some
<br />
of the tasks.  The vegetable gardens that helped sustain them
<br />
also needed tending.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at this point that Sonic tended to make himself
<br />
scarce.  Not that he was lazy; as with his schoolwork, he simply
<br />
got bored easily.  But if Tails wanted to &quot;help,&quot; Sonic would pull
<br />
his share of the load without complaint.  However Sonic might feel
<br />
about a particular task, he seemed to want to set a good example
<br />
for the adoring cub.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, however, would sometimes spend the afternoon in
<br />
Julayla's hut.  There they would review old volumes of Mobian
<br />
letters and lore that Julayla had managed to save during the
<br />
invasion, and the gaps in Sally's knowledge of the history of the
<br />
House of Acorn would be filled in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As evening approached, everyone gathered in the main hut for
<br />
the second meal of the day.  Then before bedtime, there would be
<br />
play outdoors (weather permitting).  Lately, this had meant
<br />
dividing up to play Capture the Flag, a game of which Sally never
<br />
seemed to tire.  Yet lately it seemed that nothing went right
<br />
when they played the game.  No matter what team configuration
<br />
they formed, something would happen to bring the game to a
<br />
premature halt.  Either Sonic would ignore strategy and make some
<br />
rash move that would give away his position, or else Bunnie would
<br />
refuse to try sneaking through foliage for fear of ruining her
<br />
ears, or else Antoine would find something new to complain about,
<br />
or else Tails (who was too young to take part in the game) would
<br />
give away Sonic's position by ignoring everyone else and walking
<br />
up to the hiding place of his older idol.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this afternoon, with a slight nip in the air and the
<br />
wind sounding through the trees, Sally seemed more than just lost
<br />
in thought as she looked at the blank piece of paper on the table
<br />
before her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your first question,&quot; Julayla said.  &quot;What happened on this
<br />
date in the year 2275?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally said nothing and wrote nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you hear me, Princess?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry, Julayla.  It's just that...oh, what's the point?&quot; 
<br />
She let the pencil she was holding fall to the table.  Julayla
<br />
rose from her chair and seated herself on the bench where Sally
<br />
was seated.  She knew better than to say anything right away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Julayla, why am I doing this?&quot; Sally eventually asked. 
<br />
&quot;This would all make sense if I were going to rule Mobius one
<br />
day.  But it doesn't make sense.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pause.  &quot;What happened?&quot; Julayla finally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Last night, when I was in bed, I closed my eyes and tried
<br />
to remember what my old room looked like.  But I couldn't.  I
<br />
couldn't even remember the color!&quot;  She looked at Julayla, her
<br />
eyes beginning to fill with tears.  &quot;I'm forgetting it, Julayla! 
<br />
I'm forgetting it all!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally threw her arms around Julayla and began to cry. 
<br />
Julayla said nothing and simply held her close.  After a couple
<br />
of minutes, Sally was able to regain her composure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry,&quot; Sally sniffled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't ever apologize for caring too deeply, Princess.  You
<br />
may go now, if you want to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And tell the other children that there will be no class
<br />
tomorrow.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 4
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic drew the shades of the hut and looked to see that the
<br />
door was bolted.  &quot;OK, Tails, nobody can see in.  You ready?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh huh.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go for it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails closed his eyes and his two tails began moving in a
<br />
circular motion.  Nothing else happened for a second.  But then
<br />
Tails began slowly rising off the floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doin' good, big guy!&quot; Sonic said.  &quot;Keep it up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails looked rather awkward with his legs dangling beneath him
<br />
and his rump in line with his head.  But he continued to slowly
<br />
gain altitude.  He managed to get halfway to the hut's ceiling
<br />
when, exhausted by the effort, he let himself fall into Sonic's
<br />
outstretched arms. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way to go, Tails!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How far did I get?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;About halfway up.  You're getting better each time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool!  When are we gonna show the others?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pretty soon.  But it's our secret until then, OK?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK.  Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How come you didn't finish your supper?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know; I guess I'm just tired of having the same
<br />
stuff all the time.  And I was thinking about how Uncle Chuck
<br />
used to make chili dogs.  They were great,&quot; he added as he unbolted the
<br />
door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's a chili dog?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yeah, I guess you never had one.  Man, are YOU missing
<br />
out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, how did he make 'em?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you know what a hot dog is, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh huh.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you know what chili is?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, right.  Well, it's sorta like a real spicy bean stew.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Eeeew!  Doesn't sound so good to me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, trust me on this one: it tastes a lot better than it
<br />
sounds!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then there was a knock at the cabin door.  That meant
<br />
one of the grown-ups doing a bed-check.  Sure enough, a second
<br />
later the door opened and Julayla looked inside.  &quot;Is everything
<br />
all right?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh huh,&quot; Tails replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those aren't proper words, Miles,&quot; Julayla said.  She never
<br />
missed an opportunity to correct Tails' speech, just as she could
<br />
never bring herself to call Tails by his nickname.  She felt
<br />
nicknames to be improper, especially nicknames that were so...so
<br />
anatomical!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry.  Everything's OK.  G'night!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night Miles.  Good night, Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She waited until the two boys were in their respective beds.
<br />
She then extinguished the candle that burned on a nightstand
<br />
close to the door.  Once she closed the door, however, that was
<br />
no guarantee that Sonic and Tails would go to sleep.  In fact,
<br />
most nights it was their cue to continue talking.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where did Uncle Chuck live?&quot; Tails asked in the darkness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In Mobotropolis; in the city.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where in the city?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In a house, a place bigger than this one.  And not too far
<br />
from a park with a really neat playground.  I'll show you,&quot; Sonic
<br />
said as he pulled a flashlight from under his bed and turned it on. 
<br />
He then got out of bed and walked to a small table and chair in the
<br />
room.  He took a scrap of paper and a short pencil.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, let's say Knothole is here.  This is the Great Forest
<br />
and it comes out to just about here.  Right here's the park and
<br />
the playground in the park.  And there's a block of houses over
<br />
here.  And...THIS one, from the end, that's where Uncle Chuck's
<br />
house is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool!  Can you show me where it is for real some day?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can count on it, big guy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned out the flashlight and the two found their way
<br />
back to their beds.  &quot;Man, this is nothing like living with Uncle
<br />
Chuck!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What was it like?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In some ways it was kinda fun.  It was just the two of us,
<br />
nobody else.  He worked a lot, and that was kind of a drag, but
<br />
we still spent a lot of time together.  Maybe that's why he made
<br />
chili dogs: they were real easy and it was just for the two of us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess the worst part was cooking the chili, 'cause it
<br />
always took forever!  He had to get the spices mixed just right,
<br />
and he always used to sweat that part.  But that was cool, too,
<br />
'cause that's when Uncle Chuck and me, we'd just talk to each
<br />
other while it cooked.  Kinda like you and me are doing now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What'ja talk about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just about anything.  And Uncle Chuck never talked to me
<br />
like he was a grown-up and I was a kid--the way the grown-ups
<br />
around here do.  I think that's one of the things I miss most about
<br />
Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He tried talking to me about his brother a couple of times,
<br />
about the kind of life he led and stuff, but I guess I wasn't
<br />
paying all that much attention back then.  Now I wish I had. 
<br />
'Cause now I know he was talking about...about my Dad.  Only I
<br />
didn't know it and Uncle Chuck didn't want to come out and say
<br />
it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was about to go on, but he stopped.  Across the
<br />
darkened room he could hear the steady rhythm of Tails breathing. 
<br />
Sonic smiled.  &quot;Sweet dreams, little bro,&quot; he whispered.
