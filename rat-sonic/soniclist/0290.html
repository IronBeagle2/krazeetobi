&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 1
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a thick fog that morning, and that was good news
<br />
as far as Bunnie was concerned.  While it made it harder for her
<br />
to spot any incoming SWAT-bots, it made it harder for them to
<br />
spot her as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She reached the base of the tree where a lookout post had
<br />
been set up: little more than a platform that ringed the trunk of
<br />
the tree about 30 feet up off the ground.  Using a rope ladder,
<br />
she climbed to the top and began her several hours of sentry
<br />
duty.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the day had been clear, she could have seen, about a
<br />
hundred feet from where she was, the spot where the forest met
<br />
the Great Plain.  Far down along the southern horizon could be
<br />
seen a hazy spot.  This had once been Mobotropolis, the capitol
<br />
city of the planet Mobius.  Now it was called Robotropolis, a
<br />
dark testament to the evil genius of the planet's overlord, Dr.
<br />
Ivo Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie couldn't clearly remember the details of that day a
<br />
decade ago when the once-beautiful world had fallen into
<br />
Robotnik's hands.  She herself had only been a child at the time,
<br />
and the episode had the haziness of a half-remembered bad dream. 
<br />
That was why she enjoyed the fog: it was easy to pretend, if only
<br />
for a moment, that nothing had ever gone wrong.  That
<br />
Mobotropolis was not now a choking, blighted factory instead of a
<br />
garden city, or that most of its inhabitants hadn't been
<br />
roboticized, turned into living machines that live only to serve
<br />
at Robotnik's twisted pleasure.  To imagine that she could simply
<br />
toss aside her role as a member of the Knothole freedom fighters
<br />
and live a real life once more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was no forgetting for Bunnie.  She was reminded of
<br />
her life every time she looked at her left arm, or at either of
<br />
her legs.  For she had been partially roboticized herself.  Her
<br />
limbs were clad with metal and shot through with transistors and
<br />
relays and other hardware.  It had earned her the name &quot;Bunnie
<br />
Rabbot,&quot; and although the other freedom fighters meant well when
<br />
they gave her the name, there were time she sincerely hated that
<br />
name.  Wondering when she'd ever be whole again, she reached into
<br />
her pack, took out a range finder, began scanning the horizon...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and found herself looking at a SWAT-bot not three feet in
<br />
front of her.  Gasping, she lowered the range-finder, and could
<br />
barely make out in the fog one of Robotnik's hover units level
<br />
with the platform, silently hanging in the air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HALT, FREEDOM FIGHTER!&quot;  the bot ordered in its mechanical
<br />
monotone.  &quot;YOU ARE UNDER...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SWAT-bot never got a chance to finish the sentence, as
<br />
its head suddenly flew away from its body.  Someone or something
<br />
was standing behind it, holding a large tree branch in its right
<br />
hand.  The fog was still too dense for Bunnie to make it out
<br />
clearly, but in a moment, another SWAT-bot could be seen leaving
<br />
the hover unit and approaching the shadowy figure from behind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sensing the SWAT-bot's presence, the figure spun around and
<br />
delivered a solid punch to the SWAT-bot's midsection.  Bunnie
<br />
could see the bot crumble to the platform.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The platform!  Bunnie could sense other SWAT-bots leaving
<br />
the hover unit and stepping onto the platform, and it was more
<br />
weight than the platform was meant to hold.  The figure grabbed
<br />
Bunnie by the hand as the platform gave way beneath her.  A
<br />
second later, the two of them were dangling from a rope that had
<br />
apparently been tied to a branch higher up the tree.  But the
<br />
sudden stop caused the strange figure to lose its grip on Bunnie,
<br />
and she resumed falling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie made a grab for the rope ladder and missed.  There
<br />
was one chance now: sensing that a tree branch was just below
<br />
her, she tried righting herself so that her robotic legs would
<br />
bear the brunt of the impact.  They did, but they also snapped
<br />
the branch in two.  Her descent was slowed, but she continued to
<br />
fall to the ground with such force that she lost consciousness on
<br />
impact.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you all right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Bunnie slowly came to, the first thing she was aware of
<br />
was the voice.  It managed to cut through the pounding of her
<br />
head.  She was glad to recognize the voice as that of her friend
<br />
and fellow freedom fighter, Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, Ah'm OK, Sal.  Or Ah will be as soon as they stop
<br />
playin' them drums.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her head was beginning to clear as she felt someone helping
<br />
her to her feet.  She opened her eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first she thought that her landing was still affecting
<br />
her senses.  The figure before her didn't look like Sally at all.
<br />
It wore a long, tattered cape the color of a dead leaf. 
<br />
Clustered near the shoulders on either side were small metallic
<br />
buttons, badges and insignia of some sort; they appeared to have
<br />
been sprinkled on in random fashion.  The figure also wore a head
<br />
scarf of the same color, with a veil covering the rest of the
<br />
face and permitting room only for the eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, girl, what the hoo-ha you doin' in that get-up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Bunnie looked at the right hand of the figure, the hand
<br />
that had helped her to her feet.  It gleamed with the same
<br />
sickening metallic gleam as her own left hand and arm and her two
<br />
legs.  It was a robot hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh mah stars, you're not...Mmmmmph!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly the figure clamped her hand against Bunnie's mouth
<br />
to silence her, pinning her back to a tree at the same time. 
<br />
Bunnie could sense that her feet were no longer touching the
<br />
ground; whoever this creature was, she was incredibly strong. 
<br />
She could see the eyes of the stranger narrowing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You called me 'Sally' just now, didn't you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie nodded.  What was going on here?  The stranger's
<br />
voice sounded just like Sally's!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The next time you see this 'Sally' I want you to give her
<br />
this.&quot;  With her free hand, she reached up and pulled one of the
<br />
metal pins from her cloak.  &quot;If this means anything to her, have
<br />
her meet me tomorrow night at the foot of Dragonsnest at
<br />
moonrise.  Alone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cloaked figure dropped the pin to the ground, then took
<br />
her hand away from Bunnie's mouth.  In the second it took Bunnie
<br />
to look for the pin, pick it up and look up, the mysterious
<br />
figure had melted into the forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie picked herself up off the forest floor.  The fog was
<br />
beginning to lift enough for her to survey the damage.  The
<br />
remnants of the platform, and of five SWAT-bots lay around her,
<br />
and there was no telling how many there might still be on what
<br />
was left of the lookout platform above her.  The heads were
<br />
missing from two of them, robot arms had been detatched from
<br />
their bodies and lay scattered on the ground.  The hover unit was
<br />
nowhere to be seen.  Bunnie walked over to one fallen bot and
<br />
studied the hole in its chest.  She clenched her own robotic hand
<br />
into a fist and inserted it into the hole; it was almost a
<br />
perfect fit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was crazy, Bunnie thought.  She may have learned some
<br />
martial arts techniques but she'd never thought to try taking on
<br />
a SWAT-bot in hand-to-hand combat.  Whoever had done this was
<br />
either incredibly brave or incredibly foolish.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that Bunnie remembered the strange figure, the
<br />
one who sounded so much like Sally but obviously wasn't.  But
<br />
then again...she looked at the pin the stranger had left with
<br />
her.  It looked like some sort of a brooch, and there was
<br />
something familiar about the design...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Bunnie!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Over here, Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before it occurred to Bunnie that things had gotten
<br />
interesting the last time she thought she recognized a voice,
<br />
Sonic the Hedgehog ran up to her.  &quot;You OK, Bunnie?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah guess so.  Had me a little trouble with some SWAT-bots,
<br />
but....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa, check it out!&quot; he said as he picked up a SWAT-bot's
<br />
severed head.  &quot;Man, you've been kickin' some serious bot butt!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks, Sugarhog, but it wasn't me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell you later.  Right now we gotta get back to Knothole.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be continued
