&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's another of mine.  Adam is in it.  Yes, the person I mentioned in
<br />
&quot;Nano-Wars.&quot;  Ironically enough, the first one I wrote comes last.  This
<br />
one's sandwiched somewhere in the middle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam is a numbat.  (Don't worry, I didn't spoil anything.)  Knuckles is an
<br />
echidna, Gabriel is a pangolin, Adam completes the set.  (Hey, I thought it
<br />
was a good idea!)

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams had to work fast.  He knew if he couldn't react fast enough, it
<br />
would all be over.  His fingers reached to different parts of the terminal,
<br />
pressing buttons here and there.  A maniacal laugh came from a few buildings
<br />
down the street.  He was loosing and had to come back fast.  As he worked,
<br />
he tried to keep one step ahead of himself so he knew what to do next and
<br />
how to do it.  Finally, it came to him: he was loosing!  He quickly put his
<br />
plan into action.  After he was finished, he stepped back from the terminal,
<br />
took a sigh of relief, and waited.  A few seconds later, he received a
<br />
communication.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are evil!  Evil, evil, evil!  I HAD you!&quot;  It was his friend, Adam,
<br />
calling to congratulate him on a game well played.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was a simple procedure, really.  Something to keep for next time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Next time!?!  Next time you won't even have a chance--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can threaten me on the way back to Wespero.  It's already dark,
<br />
let's go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  I'll meet you at your terminal.&quot;  He started to walk down the
<br />
street towards Williams' terminal.  It was only a few buildings away.  &quot;So
<br />
what exactly did you do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As I was saying before, it was simple.  I just wrote a short program to
<br />
keep checking if I was okay and sent it to some other terminal.  If at any
<br />
time I went off-line, it would reactivate my terminal and deactivate yours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you DID lose!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, uh.  According to the rules, you must be off-line for at least
<br />
three seconds to loose.  I believe you're the one who made that rule.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah?  Well let's change it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine by me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you get by my defenses, anyway?  I had so many back-ups you
<br />
couldn't even begin--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams sighed.  &quot;You and your defenses.  You can't rely too much on
<br />
defenses.  No matter how good your programs are, there's always a way to get
<br />
by them.  All they do is buy you some time.  That's why--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently they almost bought me enough time.  I had you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll give you that.  But you could've won a long time before if you had
<br />
a better offense.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam met his friend and they began their walk back to Wespero, their tiny
<br />
village near the Great Swamp.  &quot;But YOU have the better offense.  You hit me
<br />
before I have a chance to attack.  That's why I need a good defense.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then work on speed.  If you hit me first, I'll be working on recovering
<br />
which gives you more time to work on better attackers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked along a bit more.  Williams waved as a squadron of hover
<br />
units passed by.  It landed and deployed its Swat-bots to capture the two
<br />
rebels.  They went peacefully.  As they were being loaded into a hover unit,
<br />
Adam made an obvious observation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, neat!  A prisoner!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams noticed it also.  In the corner was a tiny skunk, maybe nine or
<br />
ten years old.  They both sat down in the back, but no one said anything
<br />
for a while.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you get caught?&quot; asked the skunk, with a touch of anger in her
<br />
voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We didn't,&quot; explained Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried again, this time asking Williams, &quot;How did you get caught?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're just here for the ride.  When we land, we'll be on our way and
<br />
you'll be roboticized and live the rest of your life, which is a long time
<br />
since you'll be a robot, blindly obeying any and all orders Robotnik gives
<br />
you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was getting impatient.  &quot;Stop joking!  Listen,&quot; she started to
<br />
whisper, &quot;I've been figuring out how we can escape.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back up,&quot; Williams was whispering also.  &quot;First of all, the Swat-bots
<br />
can hear us.&quot;  He continued in his normal tone of voice, &quot;Secondly,
<br />
technically we are 'prisoners by order of Robotnik' or something like that,
<br />
but this is our stop and soon we won't be.  Adam.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam took his cue, &quot;Computer, change all the Swat-bots' orders in this
<br />
squadron so that they'll let us go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if nothing was wrong, the entire squadron of hover units stopped and
<br />
landed.  Williams opened the door and got out.  Adam soon followed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're welcome to come with us, or you could stay and see if your plan
<br />
works.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was outside in an instant.  &quot;How did you get them to do that?&quot; she
<br />
asked as they all walked away from the area.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Simple,&quot; replied Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Quite,&quot; added Adam.  &quot;How did YOU get caught?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess I wandered too far away from my village.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you get there from here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think so......but...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But it's dark and it would be better if you came with us?&quot; asked
<br />
Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;By the way, what might I call you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nina.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Nina,&quot; bowed Adam.  &quot;My name is Adam Lockard and I'll be your
<br />
hero for tonight.  This is my lowly apprentice, Xero.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Actually, I, Williams, lengthener of life spans and nullifier of
<br />
diseases, taught Adam everything he knows.  Speaking of which, I still need
<br />
to teach you more about a good, quick offense.  I've found that--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excuse me,&quot; Nina broke in, &quot;but what are you talking about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just a game we play.  Every so often we come here to battle each other
<br />
to the death.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You come here......to play games?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the best place.  Robotnik's the only one I know of who has a huge
<br />
network of terminals throughout an entire city.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina still couldn't believe it.  As they walked she got lost in the
<br />
conversation again, but absorbed as much as she could.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were arriving in Wespero when Kristen saw them coming and ran up to
<br />
meet them.  &quot;Where have you been?&quot;  She hugged Williams tightly.  &quot;You never
<br />
come back this late!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The game got pretty exciting, he almost won.  We even brought back a
<br />
present for you.  Nina, this is Kristen, our obsolete nurse.  Kristen, this
<br />
is Nina, a girl we met on a hover unit.  We thought it would be best if she
<br />
stayed here for the night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She can stay in my hut,&quot; invited Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Done.  I'll see all of you in the morning and we'll figure out what to
<br />
do then.&quot;  He kissed Kristen good night and then left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be retiring also.&quot;  Adam left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you can come with me.&quot;  Kristen led Nina to her hut.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina tried to get to sleep, but could not.  She snuck out of her room and
<br />
saw a light on in another hut.  Peeking in through the window, she saw
<br />
Williams sitting in a chair talking to someone.  She knocked on the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; called Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;May I come in?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you must.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can sit...&quot; he looked around his hut, &quot;...anywhere where there's
<br />
room.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found a place on the bed and started to move some equipment aside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh--  Put that--  Never mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She sat down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You couldn't sleep either?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, not 'couldn't' exactly.  More like 'don't.'  I go to bed after
<br />
everybody else and wake up before everybody else.  When nobody else is
<br />
around, I work.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you working on now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Three or four things.  Controlling other computers, nanites, that
<br />
terminal war game that needs a name, and the void.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nanites?  Void?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have time.  Remember about year ago when everybody got sick?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That happened to you too?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It happened to everybody on the planet.  It was caused by a few
<br />
octillion nanites.  I got rid of them all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU?  How?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't have that much time.  The void is something I found out about
<br />
in Robotnik's computer core.  Presumably, it's the gateway to another
<br />
dimension.  I'm trying to open it, or at least understand it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She thought about what he had said and, remembering what had happened in
<br />
Robotropolis, commented, &quot;You're much more interesting than anybody in my
<br />
village.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled.  &quot;I think you'll find that I'm much more interesting than
<br />
anybody here, also.  Besides Adam.  He's pretty interesting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you two brothers?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ha!  No.  He's just a friend who escaped the coup d'etat with me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about......your parents?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not your fault.  I'm not sure exactly what happened to them, but
<br />
I'm assuming they were roboticized.  If that's so, it's a simple matter of
<br />
deroboticizing them.  I just haven't been able to locate them yet.  Which
<br />
leads me to believe that they're dead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm so sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It...is...not...your...fault,&quot; he enunciated.  &quot;So, why'd you want to
<br />
see me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh.  I couldn't sleep and I saw your light on.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So I thought we could talk.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;About what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know.  You're making this very difficult.  I'm spending the
<br />
night in some strange village with people I've never met and everybody's
<br />
worried about me back home.&quot;  She sounded if she was going to cry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Calm down.  Just go to sleep and everything will be fine tomorrow.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded and started to get in Williams' bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No--  What're you--  Fine.&quot;  He cleared off the miscellaneous objects
<br />
from his bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina got into bed, got comfortable, and tried to go to sleep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll just sleep in my chair,&quot; he told her.  Of course, Williams stayed
<br />
up after she finally fell asleep, researching the void.  But he eventually
<br />
had to sleep also.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke suddenly to the sound of someone banging on the door.  Strange,
<br />
someone actually got up before him.  Williams didn't answer, so it was
<br />
opened from the outside.  It was Kristen.  She was breathing heavily and she
<br />
spoke fast.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nina's gone!  Have you seen her?  Where'd she go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams, half-awake, answered, &quot;Yeah, she's been here all night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!?!  You didn't tell me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She came in during the middle of the night, I didn't want to wake you.
<br />
Apparently, she wanted to sleep here, so I let her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Next time, tell me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Next time?  How many more times is this going to happen?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen walked over to Nina, sleeping soundly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you doing now?  Don't wake her, the sun is just coming up.  Let
<br />
her sleep a little more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen didn't hear him.  She gently nudged Nina, who woke up startled.
<br />
She let out a yelp, but soon recovered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's morning already?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not quite,&quot; Williams rhetorically replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is everybody up so early?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ask Kristen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You weren't in bed, I came looking for you,&quot; Kristen answered the
<br />
question.  &quot;Why did you sneak out like that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I couldn't sleep, I saw Williams was up so I visited him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You shouldn't run off like that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Williams, &quot;now that we're all up, let's go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where?&quot; asked Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To take Nina home, where else?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now is the perfect time.  We might be able to get there before anybody
<br />
wakes up.&quot;  He got up out of his chair and left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait up!&quot;  Nina followed him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen went to wake Adam up.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams and Nina were waiting as Adam met them outside of the village.
<br />
It was early and cold, the wind made things worse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where's Kristen?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's not coming.  Said she needed more sleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well she's the one who woke everybody up at this ungodly hour.  Which
<br />
way?&quot; he asked Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know where we are.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then we're going back to Robotropolis.  As soon as you recognize
<br />
something and can find your way back, let me know.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mentioned something about derobotization,&quot; Nina commented as they
<br />
were walking.  &quot;Can you really undo that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's just say that when you can manipulate molecules, you can do a lot
<br />
of things.&quot;  He didn't want to get into the finer points of changing the
<br />
molecular structure of metal to skin.  &quot;And if you can manipulate individual
<br />
protons, neutrons, and electrons, you're a god.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why's that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because then you can change anything into anything else.  Don't like
<br />
pollution?  Then change it into ice cream.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, huh.  And when you get down to quarks...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you know all this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You pick up some things when you hang around a physicist all day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked some more.  &quot;What about you, Adam?&quot; asked Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me about yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's not much to tell.  Robotnik took over, I came here with
<br />
Williams, the end.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about your family?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam didn't answer.  So Williams answered for him, &quot;Siblings: none.
<br />
Parents: dead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doesn't anybody in this village have parents?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kristen has her mother.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the deal with Kristen?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams laughed.  &quot;You ask that as if there was something morally wrong
<br />
with her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You shouldn't be.  You made a joke.  I'm proud of you.&quot;  He patted her
<br />
on the shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But I insulted your girlfriend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, come on.  THAT was not an insult.  Adam can do better.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course there's something morally wrong with her,&quot; Adam was back in
<br />
the conversation, &quot;she likes YOU.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See.  That was......  Actually, that was directed at me.  But it was a
<br />
good try.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Glad to be of service.  Shall I try again?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, thank you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you take anything seriously?&quot; asked Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But your parents are dead.  HIS parents are dead.  You don't find
<br />
that...serious?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope.  It's just a part of life.  No, wait.  It's a part of death.  But
<br />
it's the end of life which means it's a part of life.  But they're not
<br />
alive, so it can't be.  Wait.  When does somebody die?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina thought about it.  &quot;When they're not alive any more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, that's like saying 'the square root of negative two equals x where
<br />
x equals the square root of negative two.'  Of course they're not alive,
<br />
that's why they're dead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You should've seen him trying to explain the universe,&quot; Adam told her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I DID explain it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right.  Matter spontaneously popping out of nowhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the only explanation.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They walked for quite a while.  Robotropolis was pretty close by the time
<br />
Nina told Williams she knew where to go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, bye.&quot;  Williams began to walk back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!  Where are you going?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have to escort her to her village,&quot; Adam reminded him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can find your way to your village, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you don't need our help anymore.  We'll see you again sometime.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can't just leave her here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams pulled Adam aside.  &quot;If we take her home, they'll want to meet
<br />
us.  They'll ask us where we came from and will want to visit us.  I don't
<br />
want to have to deal with another village.  You can go with her if you want
<br />
but please, don't bring anybody back with you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Understood.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nina, go home and enjoy life.  Good-bye.&quot;  Williams continued walking
<br />
back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just...trust us, okay?&quot;  Adam followed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina stood there for a moment, deciding what to do.  She could run after
<br />
them and get them to take her the rest of the way, but she didn't.  Williams
<br />
was right, she didn't need their help anymore.  She wasn't scared of being
<br />
caught or getting lost, she just didn't want them to leave.  &quot;You're a very
<br />
interesting man, Williams,&quot; she thought to herself as she began her journey
<br />
back home.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End...
<br />
