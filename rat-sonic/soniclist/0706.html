Greetings All!
<br />

<br />
I know its been awhile since I posted, but I'm back!
<br />

<br />
For those of you who have been screaming at me for a new story (I forgive 
<br />
you :&gt;) here is part 1 of &quot;The Experiment&quot;.  A story loosly based on one 
<br />
of my favorite video games, &quot;Burn: Cycle&quot; for the CD-i system.
<br />

<br />
Opinions are always welcomed.  Enjoy!
<br />

<br />
Story:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lone shuttle flew through the night skies.  On board, Packbell 
<br />
sat in the pilots seat with a grim expression on his face.  He had been 
<br />
called back to Robotropolis to perform one of the lowest services anybody 
<br />
could be asked to perform, new prisoner orientation.  Normally, when a 
<br />
large group of rebels were captured, they were officially charged with 
<br />
treason against Robotnik, found guilty and sentenced to the robotizizer 
<br />
after an agonizingly long stay in the holding cells.  Normally, a 
<br />
Swat-bot was assigned to give the orientation, but, for some reason, 
<br />
Packbell had been selected for this duty.  As a First Class Commander, 
<br />
prisoner orientation was listed under his job duties, but he was rarely 
<br />
assigned it because both he and Robotnik knew there were better things 
<br />
Packbell could be doing with his time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell sighed as he set the shuttle down in a landing bay.  
<br />
Stopping by his quarters to grab his dress cloak, he headed to the 
<br />
prisoner orientation chamber.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chamber was massive.  It had fifty rows of benches facing a 
<br />
raised podium.  Behind the podium was a large screen on which could be 
<br />
displayed the many terrible robotization and interrigation recordings 
<br />
that were always made.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell stood behind the podium and waited patiently.  Soon, 
<br />
Swat-bots began escorting rebel freedom fighters into the room.  It was 
<br />
the typical scene that Packbell was so used to.  Some silent, some 
<br />
crying, some glaring at him in defiance, families holding to one 
<br />
another.  How pathetic, thought Packbell.  Soon, the entire group was 
<br />
sitting in front of him.  He began to speak from the script that sat in 
<br />
his memory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As a Commander in the Robotropolis Central Command, it is my 
<br />
duty to inform you that you have all been charged with treason against 
<br />
the Emporor of Mobius, Ivo Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those words, some leaped up and began shouting words of 
<br />
defiance.  Packbell rarely listened to such nonsense.  The Swat-bots 
<br />
quickly silenced them by shooting warning shots over the heads of the 
<br />
crowd.  When the crowd quieted down, he continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Haveing been so charged, you have been tried based on an 
<br />
evaluation of your general behavior, and have, consequently been found 
<br />
guilty.  You are therefore sentenced to the robotizizer after intense 
<br />
interrigation, and a stay in our holding cells until such time as we need 
<br />
more worker-bots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this some began trembling in fear, while some still haven't 
<br />
recovered from the shock of what was happening.  Suddenly, a raccoon who 
<br />
had apparently snapped from the stress, jumped up and made a desprate run 
<br />
for the door.  Before anybody could react, Packbell pulled a laser rifle 
<br />
and shot three blasts, each of which slammed into the prisoner, throwing 
<br />
him against the wall where he collapsed in a lifeless heap.  The 
<br />
prisoners stared in shock and terror at Packbell, who was still holding the 
<br />
smoking rifle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyone else feel like dying tonight?&quot; he asked, placing the 
<br />
rifle back under the podium &quot;if so, please feel free to make a run for 
<br />
any of the exits provided.  While you're here, there's one thing you need 
<br />
to understand.  I care nothing for your futile little lives, and I have 
<br />
no reservations about relieving you of each and every one of them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the Swat-bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take them away,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Swat-bots began to excort the prisoners from the room, 
<br />
Packbell suddenly had an idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; he yelled.  The Swat-bots stopped where they were.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a single sweep of the room, he analized each prisoner 
<br />
individualy.  After make delibrate calculations, he arrived at a conclusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take the twenty prisoners in the back row to my experiment 
<br />
holding cells,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Acknowleged,&quot; responded the bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell was getting tired of experimenting on worker-bots.  Some 
<br />
live subjects might just provide some better results.  He doubted that 
<br />
any of the prisoners would survive the proccess, but then, that was their 
<br />
problem.  Packbell left the prison block and headed for the Scientific 
<br />
Research Building.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Charles Hedgehog was widely know among the resistance for his 
<br />
logical attitude and somber manner when it came to getting a job done.  
<br />
What was not well known was that a part of him always craved living life 
<br />
on the edge, and playing the part of a Freedom Fighter spy deep inside 
<br />
Robotropolis was about as close to the edge as one could get without 
<br />
falling over completely.  Not that he took the job lightly, he was always 
<br />
very serious about it, because if he were ever found out, he'd be 
<br />
interrogated and either reprogrammed or sent to the scrap pile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having finished his duty cycle, he quietly slipped away from the 
<br />
other worker-bots and went to the his hideout to continue with a few 
<br />
things he had to do.  First, however, he sat down in front of his 
<br />
computer and tapped into the section were Commanders post their daily 
<br />
progress reports to see if anything remotely important had happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he scrolled down the list, everything appeared to be pretty 
<br />
much the same, that is, until he got to Packbell's entry:
<br />

<br />
REPORT #:548722226-457B
<br />
DESIGNATION: PACKBELL
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
1900HRS -- SUCCESSFULLY CAPTURED 165 REBELS LOCATED IN GREAT JUNGLE
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
END REPORT
<br />
AUTHORIZATION: 458-5874412-55
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ridiculous, thought Chuck, if this keeps up, Sally won't have
<br />
any freedom fighters left to contact even if she does find her father's 
<br />
list.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He connected to the prison block records to check on the status 
<br />
of the new prisoners.  Some could be rescued if they were being held in 
<br />
the right areas.  Looking over the reports, he noticed something unusual.
<br />
The number of new prisoners proccessed was 145.  Chuck stopped and 
<br />
thought a moment.  Packbell had reported a score of 165, so someone was 
<br />
off by twenty.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he thought, the more Chuck began to worry.  This was the
<br />
tenth discrepancy in the records regarding prisoners and worker-bots in 
<br />
the last four months, and, in every error, Packbell had somehow been 
<br />
involved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck realized that something was going on, and he was beginning 
<br />
to think that not even Robotnik might know.  Calling a messenger bird to 
<br />
him, Chuck dispatched a message to the Great Forest.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the Great Forest, in Knothole Village, the freedom 
<br />
fighters slept soundly.  The small bird flew, unnoticed, down past 
<br />
various huts until it came to rest in the window of the hut belonging to 
<br />
Princess Sally.  Sally lay in bed next to the window in a sound sleep.  
<br />
The bird began chirping rather loudly until Sally groggily woke up to see 
<br />
what the problem was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the window, she took the note from the bird and read it 
<br />
as the bird flew away.
<br />

<br />
To Knothole Freedom Fighters,
<br />

<br />
Prisoners have been disappearing en route between their orientation and 
<br />
the prison block.  Suspect Packbell is taking them to an unknown location 
<br />
for some purpose.  Request any ideas on what to do.
<br />

<br />
Respond ASAP
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at the clock on the wall.   No matter how serious 
<br />
such a problem was, no one was going to have good, suggestive ideas at 
<br />
this hour.  Folding the note and placing it on her nightstand, Sally went 
<br />
back to bed and would handle it first thing in the morning.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell walked into a chamber deep in his research center.  In 
<br />
the center was a long table with shackles on it.  Above it, hanging from 
<br />
the ceiling was a semi-circular piece of metal which appeared to have 
<br />
laser scanners attached to it, which could be moved up and down the 
<br />
length of the table.  At one end of the room was a large display screen, 
<br />
and at the other end was a large set of controls facing the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell went behind the controls and sat down.  Pressing his 
<br />
hand to a sensor on the panel, he powered the system.  For a few moments, 
<br />
he sat listening as the machine quietly sucked power from the Central 
<br />
Power Core to serve his secret, twisted purposes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the door to the room opened and two Swat-bots entered, 
<br />
escorting a frightened looking badger who they promptly strapped down to 
<br />
the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, citizen,&quot; said Packbell in a voice so friendly, it 
<br />
would fool all but the most cautious &quot;You might as well stop struggling, 
<br />
you can't leave.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badger calmed after awhile and simply glared at Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, don't be like that,&quot; continued Packbell, still speaking as 
<br />
though he were the badger's comrade &quot;Just because you've been found 
<br />
guilty of treason doesn't mean that we can't be friends.  In fact, you 
<br />
should feel honored that you're here instead of back in the prison 
<br />
block.  You see, you have been chosen to take part in an experiment that 
<br />
will change the way people think of computers and robotics forever.  
<br />
First, however, I despise having to call you 'prisoner' so why don't you 
<br />
introduce yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glaring at Packbell for a moment, the badger responded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My name's Hugo,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hugo?  Pleased to meet you, I'm Packbell, but you already know 
<br />
that,&quot; said Packbell, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now then,&quot; Packbell continued &quot;Let's get down to business.  All 
<br />
you have to do for this experiment is to lie perfectly still.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a few buttons on the panel, as the laser scanners 
<br />
began glowing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; said Packbell &quot;Good Luck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laser scanners came on and shot down onto the badger.  The 
<br />
scanners moved down the length of the subject, examining each and every 
<br />
inch of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Preliminary suject analysis complete,&quot; the computer reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Proceed to phase two, neural pathway analysis,&quot; ordered Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers changed color as they moved up towards the badger's 
<br />
head and stopped. They began an intense scan of the badger's brain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Analysis complete.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Begin Upload Processing analysis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers again scanned the badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Analysis complete&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a few more buttons on the panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Begin full upload procedure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers changed color to red and concentrated all their energy 
<br />
on the badger's mind.  On the screen at the far end of the room, was 
<br />
displayed a 3-D wire frame model of the badger and an imense amount of 
<br />
unreadable information.  All seemed to be going well for the Commander 
<br />
and he felt a slight tinge of joy at a possible success.  Suddenly, the 
<br />
information on the screen changed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING! NEURAL IMBALANCE DETECTED.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!!&quot; exclaimed Packbell, he joy turning to shock.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING! NEURAL PATHWAY COLAPSE POSSIBLE.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut down the experiment!&quot; screamed Packbell above the noise of 
<br />
the alarms that had sounded as he began frantically pushing buttons on 
<br />
the panel.  The badger's body began jerking about violently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING!  NEURAL SYNAPSE COLLAPSE IN PROGRESS&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING!  SUBJECT VITAL SIGNS FAILING.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell managed to shut off the system.  Walking over the badger 
<br />
on the table, he glared at the still slightly twitching body.  After 
<br />
standing there for what seemed like an eternity, he turned and went to 
<br />
the comm. panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Send some bots in here to dispose of the body, and bring me 
<br />
another subject in one hour,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning off the panel, he walked back to the system controls.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to get this experiment right if I have to kill every 
<br />
Mobian on the face of the planet!!!&quot; he declared, and began going through 
<br />
the program for the thousanth time looking for bugs.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the freedom fighters met in the war room to 
<br />
discuss Uncle Chuck's latest message.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The idea that Packbell is kidnapping prisoners for his own 
<br />
twisted purposes is a frightening thought,&quot; Sally was saying &quot;We've got 
<br />
to find out what he's doing with them.  any ideas?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just the obvious one, Sal,&quot; responded Sonic &quot;Jam to Robotropolis 
<br />
and find out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you know we can't go running to Robotropolis without a 
<br />
solid plan.  We don't even know exactly what we're looking for,&quot; Sally said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have you had any luck locating info on this, Bookshire?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not much,&quot; he admitted &quot;Packbell has always suspected that 
<br />
someone's been sneaking into the Core so he code-locks all his personal 
<br />
files.  I'm examining other areas to see if he forgot something, but 
<br />
it'll take time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, until we have a better idea of what's happening, there's 
<br />
not much we can do,&quot; said Sally &quot;Bookshire will continue work on on the 
<br />
computer system, but it might be a good idea to send one or two of us to 
<br />
Robotropolis to follow Packbell and see what he's up to.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, deep in Robotropolis, Bunnie and Sonic, both having 
<br />
volunteered to follow Packbell, arrived outside the main Command Center.  
<br />
After avoiding the guards, they managed to sneak inside through the 
<br />
ventelation system.  After taking many turns and searching many rooms, 
<br />
the team lucked out when they found Packbell.  He was in the main control 
<br />
room with Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You still haven't answered my question,&quot; Robotnik was saying to 
<br />
Snively &quot;Why are there prisoners missing from my holding cells!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I really don't know sir,&quot; responded Snivelly weakly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't give us that!&quot; said Packbell &quot;Do you have any idea how 
<br />
hard its been for me to capture these tratiors lately.  I've gone through 
<br />
a lot of trouble to get them and you lose them!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively glared at Packbell.  He knew that Packbell was at fault, 
<br />
but, with all the trust Robotnik had invested in his finest creation, he 
<br />
would never believe it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll keep looking into it sir,&quot; Snively said rather lamely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You do that,&quot; said Robotnik &quot;If you don't find out what happened 
<br />
to them, I'll give you to Packbell for target practice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes sir,&quot; said Snively, as he turned and left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do you keep him around, sir?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, sometimes I honestly don't know,&quot; responded Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do,&quot; said Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; replies Robotnik.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, walked from the room and out onto the side walk.  As he 
<br />
walked down the deserted street, Sonic and Bunnie followed close behind.  
<br />
They followed him to a small building.  AS he entered, Sonic and Bunnie 
<br />
stopped outside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; said Sonic &quot;I'm going to folow him in.  You stay out here 
<br />
in case he comes back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got it suger-hog,&quot; said Bunnie.  She crouched in a dark 
<br />
corner of the street as Sonic went into the old building.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic crept down the corridor.  He looked around, but saw no sign 
<br />
of Packbell.  He contiued down the corridor, certain that he'd catch up 
<br />
to Packbell eventually.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie waited patiently behind a garbage can for Sonic or 
<br />
Packbell to emerge.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, without warning, a metalic hand shot out of the 
<br />
darkness behind her, grabbed her by the back of her neck and lifted her 
<br />
easily off the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scream and die, rabbit,&quot; said a chillingly familiar voice.  The 
<br />
arm turned her around and she found herself face to face with Cmdr. 
<br />
Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you really think you could sneak up on someone with a 
<br />
proximity detector?&quot; asked Packbell, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without answering, Bunnie drove her robotic foot into Packbell's 
<br />
chest.  The Commander was unmoved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Such is the advantage of dent-proof alloys,&quot; continued Packbell 
<br />
&quot;Now, why don't we go find your friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping Bunnie in a tight grip, he returned to the building.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had searched the entire building and found nothing.  As he 
<br />
returned to the entrance, a figure appeared in the doorway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, hedgehog!&quot; said Packbell &quot;I believe this belongs to you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell held Bunnie firmly in his right hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let her go, metal head!&quot; ordered Sonic as he prepared to rush 
<br />
the commander.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you,&quot; remarked Packbell &quot;Your 
<br />
distance from me is such that you could never get to me in time to 
<br />
prevent me from breaking this beautiful rabbit's neck.  Now, I suggest 
<br />
you stay where you are unless you believe taking me down is worth your 
<br />
friend's death.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stopped where he was knowing that Packbell was right.  
<br />
There was no guarantee he could get to Packbell in time to save Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just the two of you,&quot; Packbell replied &quot;I've sent a transmission 
<br />
to my team at the Research Center informing them you are on your way.  
<br />
You will go there and allow them to escort you to a special cell I made 
<br />
just for you.  If you have any ideas of doubling back, just remember that 
<br />
all I need is to hear your sonic boom and Bunnie is as good as dead.  Now 
<br />
go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic wanted nothing more than to rip into Pakbell and tear him 
<br />
apart, but his logic finally won out.  He moved past Packbell and ran off 
<br />
towards the center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're friend appears to be a very reasonable person,&quot; Packbel 
<br />
remarked to Bunnie as they started for the center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll never get away with this,&quot; said Bunnie defiantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, well, another satisfied member of the cliche of the month 
<br />
club,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lightning move, he shifted his grip on her neck, robbing her 
<br />
of her conciousness.  He continued walking towards the Research Center 
<br />
where his experiment awaited.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the Center, Packbell proceeded directly to the 
<br />
holding cells where Sonic sat in a cell guarded by ten Swat-bots.  Still 
<br />
keeping the unconcious Bunnie in his grip, he gazed at Sonic through the 
<br />
force field.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the deal, Packbell,&quot; demanded Sonic &quot;What have you been 
<br />
doing with these 'extra' prisoners?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That isn't your concern at the moment.  However, you'll find out 
<br />
soon enough,&quot; said Packbell &quot;It was a tough decision, but I have decided 
<br />
that you will be the next subject for my experiment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a button on the wall.  Suddenly, Sonic cell was 
<br />
filled with sleeping gas.  Sonic collapsed to the floor.  Packbell turned 
<br />
to one of the bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take the hedgehog to the chamber,&quot; he ordered.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sonic began to wake, he realized he was strapped tightly to a 
<br />
long metal table in the middle of a large room.  Looking around, he saw 
<br />
Bunnie in the tight grip of a Swat-bot while Packbell began to power the 
<br />
machine.  Sonic struggled to break free, but something was holding him in 
<br />
place.  Watching him struggle, Packbell grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Force fields are wonderful things aren't they,&quot; he remarked 
<br />
&quot;Just relax.  I've worked out all the bugs this time so there shouldn't 
<br />
be any problems.  Granted, thats what I thought the last five times I 
<br />
tried it, but this time I'm sure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that what you do with those prisoners?&quot; demanded Bunnie &quot;You 
<br />
experiment on them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; answered Packbell, casually &quot;The worker-bots just 
<br />
weren't delivering the results I had hoped for.  They kept having neural 
<br />
breakdowns and had to be scrapped.  Some saved me the trouble by 
<br />
exploding.  Very intersting effects, but they were setbacks just the same.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're insane, Packbell,&quot; yelled Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, and you're fast.  Do you think I care?&quot; stated Packbell as 
<br />
the system powered up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THe system indicated it's readiness.  Packbell paused for a 
<br />
moment and gazes at Sonic, lying strapped to the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See you in infinity,&quot; he said, simply.  He flipped a switch on 
<br />
the panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, that was the last thing Sonic remembered. . .
<br />
