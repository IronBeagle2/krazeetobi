&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a list of descriptions of the three original characters 
<br />
that I created for my Sonic The Hedgehog stories.  This document's 
<br />
purpose is simply for reference when you encounter one of the characters 
<br />
in the story.
<br />

<br />
Profile: 01
<br />
Name:  Bookshire Draftwood
<br />
Species:  Raccoon
<br />
Sex:  Male
<br />
Age:  36
<br />
War Standing:  rebel sympathizer
<br />
Occupation:  Great Forest Freedom Fighter (unofficial)
<br />
Specialties:  computer and medical technology
<br />

<br />
Summary:  Bookshire is a middle-aged raccoon who, before the take over, 
<br />
made a living doing numerous jobs from computer hacking to doctor.  He was 
<br />
always bouncing around from one job to another because he had never been 
<br />
exactly sure what he wanted to do with his life.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was fortunate enough to be vacationing down on the southern 
<br />
continent of Mobius when Robotnik took control of the capital city and 
<br />
slowly began to conquer the entire planet.  He managed to slip by 
<br />
Robotnik's forces and return to the capital city which was then in 
<br />
ruins.  He was almost captured by a patrol when he tried to break into 
<br />
the computer system from a workstation.  By some miracle, he managed to 
<br />
escape and spent the next two years wandering about aimlessly, unsure of 
<br />
how to handle all that had happened.  During his wanderings, he had a 
<br />
few run ins with robotnik's patrols.  During one of these encounters, he 
<br />
fell and broke his right leg.  The break had never healed quite right 
<br />
and it left him with a permanent limp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two years he wandered into the Great forest where he 
<br />
accidentally ran into the freedom fighters who convinced him to stay with 
<br />
them.  Since then, he has proven to be a valuable asset, first busting 
<br />
into Robotnik's mainframe, as well as numerous other services.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Profile:  02
<br />
Name:  Packbell
<br />
Species:  Artificial Lifeform  (humanoid)
<br />
Sex:  Male simulation
<br />
Age:  8
<br />
War standing:  Robotnik sympathizer
<br />
Occupation:  Commander, 1st class, Robotropolis Central Command
<br />
Specialties:  offensive and defensive battle strategies, robotizizing 
<br />
people, pushing Snively around
<br />

<br />
Summary:  Packbell is the first android in the history of Mobius to be 
<br />
declared a fully functioning artificial lifeform.  He possesses 
<br />
intelligence, self-awareness, as well as basic emotions.  He was a 
<br />
prototype designed by Robotnik just after the takeover, but the fact 
<br />
that the android turned out to be as smart as he was caused Robotnik to 
<br />
scrap the entire project.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the takeover, Packbell has been personally responsible for 
<br />
the location and destruction of twelve groups of rebel freedom fighters and 
<br />
the consequent capture and robotization of over 400 citizens.  He track 
<br />
record is flawless, and he never loses.  Despite having basic emotions, 
<br />
most freedom fighters throughout the globe know that he never shows 
<br />
anyone any mercy.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he's not terrorizing rebels, he hangs around the 
<br />
Robotropolis Command Center either goofing off or finding ways to annoy 
<br />
Snively.  He is considered to be arrogant and conceited.  What is not 
<br />
well known is that, under his loyal exterior, he waits patiently for the 
<br />
time when he can overthrow Robotnik and rule Mobius himself.
<br />

<br />
Profile:  03
<br />
Name:   Sandra Nightweaver
<br />
Species:  Fox
<br />
Sex:  Female
<br />
Age:  29
<br />
War standing:  neutral
<br />
Occupation:  Global informant and spy
<br />
Specialties:  breaking into places, ability to get information out of 
<br />
anyone or anything.
<br />

<br />
Summary:  Sandra is a loner who, before the take over, made her living 
<br />
getting and selling information to whoever made it worth her while.  She 
<br />
has even had brief run ins with the authorities before the take over.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in this time of rebellion, she has found that her profession 
<br />
has escalated and she has been known to do espionage and spy work for 
<br />
both the rebellion and for Robotnik.  She doesn't care who is in charge so 
<br />
long as she's allowed to go about her business.  When she's not spying, 
<br />
she's usually found around places such as the Mystic Caves, the 
<br />
Mountains of Peril, as well as several other locations.  She is 
<br />
constantly on the move and contacting her for the first time has be 
<br />
known to be quite a chore.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither side trusts her much, in fact, there is a rumor among the 
<br />
freedom fighters that she had helped Robotnik steal the Robotizizer plans 
<br />
form Sir Charles Hedghog's database.  This rumor has yet to be proven.
