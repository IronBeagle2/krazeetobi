<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knothole apeared empty when they arrived, for everyone was
<br />
inside fast asleep.  Sonic skidded to a halt.  He didn't dare let
<br />
go of Sally, who was still trembling like a leaf in his arms. 
<br />
&quot;Hey!  Somebody!  Anybody!  It's Sally!  She needs help!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We need help!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Assistance!  Assistance!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Light came on in some of the huts and freedom fighters came
<br />
running.  A crowd gathered around Sally, who seemed to be unaware
<br />
of what was going on around her; she was aware only of her pain. 
<br />
Finally, Bookshire Draftwood managed to push his way through the
<br />
crowd.  &quot;Get back!&quot; he yelled.  &quot;Give her some room!  Sonic, what
<br />
happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It happened all of a sudden.  We were walking away from the
<br />
badger village when it hit her...WHATEVER it is!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's holding her stomach.  What did she eat when she was
<br />
there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing that Ant and Sonic and me didn't have as well,&quot;
<br />
Bunnie answered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, so it's probably not food poisoning.  What else
<br />
happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal got in a fight with a badger.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What kind of fight?&quot;  So Sonic gave a short account of the
<br />
wrestling match.  When he spoke of the use of the Claw, however,
<br />
Bookshire became even more interested.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you notice if the spikes on the Claw were coated with
<br />
anything?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, with some kind of water.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was afraid of that.  Sonic, Rotor, Bunnie, Antoine,
<br />
you'll have to hold down Sally's limbs.  If I'm right....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four of them dropped to their knees, pinning Sally's
<br />
arms and legs to the ground.  Bookshire called for someone to
<br />
bring a light, and Rotor handed him a flashlight from his
<br />
toolbelt.  Then the raccoon began gently parting the fur on
<br />
Sally's belly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately Sally started screaming at the top of her lungs,
<br />
as if she were in the worst agony of her life.  Bunnie was so
<br />
frightened she was on the verge of crying herself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Bookshire found what he was looking for: three
<br />
superficial scratches on Sally's abdomen, each one not more than
<br />
an inch or two in length.  The skin around them was a fiery red
<br />
and blistered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought so.  We've got to get her to the pool!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool where the power ring generator was located was fed
<br />
by several streams.  The largest and most powerful stream
<br />
cascaded over rocks rounded to smoothness by years of wear.  It
<br />
was to this point above the pool that Sally was taken.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On Bookshire's orders, Sally was laid in the stream so that
<br />
her body bore the full brunt of the stream.  She gasped for
<br />
breath for the first two minutes as only her head remained above
<br />
the cold water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Easy, Princess,&quot; Bookshire said gently, &quot;try to slow your
<br />
breathing.  You don't need to hyperventilate.&quot;  Gradually her
<br />
breathing eased.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, what was THAT all about?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When you told me that they poured some sort of liquid on
<br />
the Claw, that was the clue.  The badgers call that liquid 'fire
<br />
water.'  It's distilled from a mixture of woodland leaves and
<br />
berries and yields a powerful neurotoxin....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, you're starting to sound like Nicole!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is she gonna be all right, Booker?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She'll be OK, Bunnie, but she'll have to stay in the stream
<br />
until we're sure that the Fire Water under her skin has been
<br />
diluted or flushed away.  That could take a day or two.  There's
<br />
no known counteragent and no medicine strong enough to overcome
<br />
the pain of the fire water.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not like a...poison or anything, is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, it's used to disable an opponent by distracting him
<br />
with pain.  It's not powerful enough to kill you, but just
<br />
powerful enough to make you WISH that you were dead.  It's
<br />
probably not all that strong if you're a badger.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well after seein' what they did to Sally, all Ah can say is
<br />
Ah'm glad Ah ain't!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, you'd better stay with Sally until her condition
<br />
stabilizes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Try keepin' me away, Booker!&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie didn't sleep the rest of that night as she kept watch
<br />
over Sally as she lay in the stream.  Sally's body might have
<br />
adjusted to the cold water, but her mind was still overshadowed
<br />
by pain.  Occasionally Sally would cry out after moving too much,
<br />
but she would soon settle back down again.  Finally, toward
<br />
morning, Sally was worn out from her physical ordeal, and the
<br />
pain from the fire water had subsided enough to allow her to
<br />
drift off to sleep.  Even then, Bunnie kept watch over her
<br />
friend.  It was midday when Sally awoke.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, where am I?&quot; she murmured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doctor's orders, Sally-girl.  Booker wants you to stay here
<br />
until that fire water they put on the Claw is out of your system. 
<br />
How you feelin'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like Robotnik's been sitting on me.  I also feel incredibly
<br />
stupid.  How could I let Sophocles get to me like that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Girl, Ah'd have done the same if anybody'd trash-talked
<br />
about MAH kin like that.  Ah'm just glad to have you back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the rest of the day, the two spent their time in
<br />
conversation.  So much of their lives was taken up in the fight
<br />
against Robotnik that time to simply socialize was a luxury they
<br />
couldn't always afford.  Bookshire was their only other visitor,
<br />
for he had cautioned the others to leave Sally alone until she
<br />
was well enough to return to Knothole on her own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the next morning, Sally was looking and sounding like
<br />
her old self.  Bookshire told them that Sally had apparently
<br />
weathered the storm and could return to Knothole.  Sally stiffly
<br />
rose up out of the water, climbed to the bank where Bunnie had
<br />
left Sally's boots and vest, shook herself as dry as she could,
<br />
then lay down on a flat rock in the sunlight to finish drying
<br />
off.  Sally began to chuckle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What're you laughin' at, Sally-girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was just remembering the last time I was here.  It must
<br />
have been...four summers ago, wasn't it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, Ah remember.  That had to be the hottest summer
<br />
Mobius ever had!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I remember feeling so miserable in the heat, and I knew
<br />
that my fur wasn't going to get any thinner.  Finally I couldn't
<br />
stand it any more and I came up here to lay down in the water. 
<br />
I'm not a water animal myself, but even I have to admit that it
<br />
felt so good just to lie here and be out of the heat!  It was so
<br />
comfortable I must have drifted off to sleep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The next thing I knew, Sonic and Tails came by to collect
<br />
the day's power ring.  I was so startled when Tails said 'Hi!' I
<br />
jumped up out of the water.  And then I saw Sonic staring at me
<br />
like he'd never seen me before.  Then I realized why: my fur--or
<br />
what was left of it--was clinging to me like another skin.  I've
<br />
never been so embarrassed in my life!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah guess poor Tails was too young to appreciate what he was
<br />
seein'.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about Sonic?  He couldn't look me in the eye for three
<br />
days after that!&quot;  And both Sally and Bunnie dissolved into
<br />
laughter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Bunnie,&quot; Sally said at last, &quot;I needed a good laugh!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After what them badgers put you through, Ah'd need one,
<br />
too!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't get it, though.  I've been going over the whole
<br />
situation with the Clan Wars in my mind.  There have been clashes
<br />
in the past and misunderstandings, but there have also been
<br />
individual badgers who have been fiercely loyal to the Royal
<br />
House and who served it with honor, even to the death.  But even
<br />
during the Clan Wars, no badger ever went so far as to suggest
<br />
that the monarchy be dissolved!  I just can't get over Sophocles'
<br />
saying that the Acorn Throne was corrupted and might as well be
<br />
smashed.  Something about his words just doesn't sound right, but
<br />
I can't figure out what.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, like Sugar-hog said, it's all ancient history.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;By the way, where IS Sonic?&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was walking at a slow pace.  That in itself was a
<br />
novelty.  But he didn't feel like running.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was walking back toward the clearing on the edge of the
<br />
Great Forest where he had met with Spartacus.  He remembered how
<br />
happy he was to be reunited with his childhood friend; then he
<br />
remembered how everything had gone sour in the badger camp.  Even
<br />
if the news was good and Sally was going to recover, Sonic still
<br />
couldn't understand why things had gone so wrong.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He approached the clearing, so depressed that he didn't look
<br />
to see if anyone was in there.  He stopped short, because someone
<br />
was in there.  It was Spartacus, seated on the trunk of a fallen
<br />
tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spartacus?  What're YOU doing here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I was hoping you'd come.  Is your friend Sally all
<br />
right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, she's gonna be OK.  How long you been here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Since yesterday morning.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I feel just awful about what happened.  I had no
<br />
idea that Sophocles had become so inflexible.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well, I didn't know Sally would get in the ring with
<br />
your brother.  How's he doing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's fine.  He told me that he respected your friends'
<br />
abilities in combat.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He said that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, what he said was: 'Too bad they're not badgers.' 
<br />
That's the closest he's ever come to paying a non-badger a
<br />
complement.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyone else feel that way?&quot;  Spartacus' silence was all the
<br />
answer Sonic needed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here,&quot; Spartacus finally said, &quot;give this to Sally when you
<br />
see her.&quot;  With that, he handed Sonic a rough-woven canvas bag,
<br />
tied with string at the top.  A paper tag hung from the end of
<br />
the string.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's in this thing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd rather you give it to Sally as is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh. OK.&quot;  Sonic turned to go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...I'm truly sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, it's cool.  Later.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic arrived back at Knothole a short time later, but
<br />
nobody seemed to be interested.  Instead, everyone was clustering
<br />
around Princess Sally, whom Bunnie had accompanied from the pool.
<br />
Even though Bunnie and Antoine had each answered dozens of
<br />
questions about the badgers and about the fight, everyone wanted
<br />
to hear about it from Sally.  What she said wasn't exactly good
<br />
news:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I don't think we can rely on the badgers of that clan
<br />
as freedom fighters.  Not only do they live pretty much to
<br />
themselves, but their hatred of the House of Acorn appears to be
<br />
as deep as ever.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Sal!&quot; Sonic called out.  The crowd of Mobians
<br />
surrounding Sally parted and Sonic walked toward her.  &quot;You
<br />
feeling OK?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Much better, thanks.  Where have you been?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was talking with Spartacus in the clearing.  He was
<br />
really bummed by what happened, and he said for me to give you
<br />
this.&quot;  Sonic handed the bag to Sally.  She spotted the paper tag
<br />
at the bag's neck.  She tore it off and set the bag down on the
<br />
ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, how come there's no writing on this tag?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's in that bag, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He didn't say.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyone else smell that?&quot;  Bookshire asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Tails said.  &quot;What IS that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor sniffed the air.  &quot;Smells like...pine tar.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pine tar?&quot;  Bookshire picked up the bag.  He placed his
<br />
hand against it and immediately jerked it away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everybody back off!  This thing's hot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone backed away.  Everyone, that is, except Sonic. 
<br />
Taking the bag from Bookshire, he bolted from the clearing,
<br />
returning two seconds later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No problemo, guys.  I pitched that thing into the Great
<br />
Swamp.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone started to congratulate Sonic, but Sally seemed
<br />
lost in thought.  Then, borrowing a rangefinder from Rotor, she
<br />
ran toward a nearby tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where do you think you're going?&quot; Bookshire called after
<br />
her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You SAID I needed some exercise after all that time flat on
<br />
my back!&quot; she called back as she began climbing.  In a few
<br />
seconds she was lost from sight, only to reappear a few more
<br />
seconds later on her way down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What was THAT all about, Sal?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've got trouble, Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, I ditched that bomb, remember?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wondered why we hadn't heard an explosion if that really
<br />
was a bomb, so I went up to have a look.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what'ja see?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw a huge column of black smoke rising from the Great
<br />
Swamp.  I also saw two of Robotnik's hover units converging on
<br />
the site, and another two on the horizon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I don't think that bomb was meant to blow up and
<br />
harm anyone.  I believe it was a smoke bomb, meant to betray our
<br />
position to Robotnik and to lead those hover units straight to
<br />
Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was sobering news to the residents of Knothole, for
<br />
whom the secrecy of their location was a tactical strength. 
<br />
Sonic took the news hard.  His expression went from shock to deep
<br />
hurt to boiling anger.  &quot;OK, THAT'S IT!!&quot; he yelled, and tore off
<br />
into the woods without a word of warning.  The others began to
<br />
pick themselves up off the ground, having been left in Sonic's
<br />
wake.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; Sally said, &quot;I've never seen Sonic so angry
<br />
about ANYTHING before!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah'd hate to be those badgers when Sugar-hog gets there!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think Sonic's going to be the least of the badgers'
<br />
worries,&quot; Bookshire observed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because if that smoke bomb was indeed Robotnik's idea, and
<br />
if Robotnik has four hover units loaded with SWATbots in the
<br />
area, those badgers are going to have some explaining to do.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;INCOMPETENT!&quot; Sophocles roared at Spartacus.  &quot;Your mission
<br />
failed!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophocles stood in the center of the assembled badgers of
<br />
the clan.  That morning, when Spartacus had returned without the
<br />
sack, the badger elder had issued a call to arms for all able-
<br />
bodies badgers of the clan.  The call went through the clan like
<br />
a bolt of lightning.  Weapons were gathered and sharpened,
<br />
anticipation ran high.  But now two young scouts had reported
<br />
that the smoke column they had been sent to follow originated,
<br />
not in some village, but in the heart of the Great Swamp. 
<br />
Sophocles didn't take the news well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It failed!&quot; he repeated.  &quot;How then are we to have our
<br />
revenge against those who sympathize with the House of Acorn?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Revenge!?&quot; Adonis spoke up, as all eyes turned to him. 
<br />
&quot;Revenge for what?  They harmed no one here except myself, and
<br />
even then the damage was only to my pride.  What cause have we to
<br />
fight them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because they represent the House of Acorn.  They are an
<br />
impediment to the rule of Mobius by its rightful overlord.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And just who is this rightful overlord, Sophocles? 
<br />
Yourself?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I speak of...Ivo Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were several seconds of stunned silence.  That name
<br />
had never crossed the lips of Sophocles before.  Adonis, baring
<br />
all his teeth in a snarl, picked up a nearby ax.  &quot;You withered
<br />
old traitor!&quot; he yelled as he hurled the ax at the old badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophocles, however, tossed aside the two younger badgers who
<br />
had been supporting him as if they were nothing.  He caught the
<br />
ax in mid-flight before it could strike him.  Then, with no
<br />
warning, he hurled it back at Adonis, where it struck him in the
<br />
chest.  He was dead before he hit the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diana began to scream, as did every other badger.  Anyone
<br />
who could pick up a weapon did so and began to rush toward
<br />
Sophocles.  It was a badger melee.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the melee was short-lived, for suddenly the woods
<br />
surrounding the badger encampment erupted with blaster fire. 
<br />
SWATbots began emerging from the woods, shoulder to shoulder. 
<br />
The melee ended as swiftly as it had started, with five more
<br />
badgers dead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophocles now strode to one of the SWATbots with a youthful
<br />
vigor the badgers had never seen before.  The SWATbot carried a
<br />
communicator, and Sophocles began speaking into it: &quot;Can you hear
<br />
me, Dr. Robotnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those badgers close enough to Sophocles could hear
<br />
Robotnik's malevolent voice on the communicator: &quot;Have you begun
<br />
the attack on Knothole yet?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Negative.  The smoke bomb was diverted to the Great Swamp,
<br />
and resistance to you among the badgers is still strong.  I had
<br />
to order the SWATbots to attack the village.  Your plan appears
<br />
to be infeasible.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;BLAST IT!&quot; Robotnik cursed, then spoke in a more measured
<br />
voice: &quot;Never mind, then.  Select the strongest of the badgers
<br />
and roboticize them; if they won't fight for me, they'll at least
<br />
slave for me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And the others, Dr. Robotnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a pause.  &quot;Do you think I really care what happens
<br />
to the others?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Understood, Sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Handing the communicator back to the SWATbot, Sophocles
<br />
strode to Spartacus who, like Diana, was bent over the fallen
<br />
Adonis.  He seized Spartacus by the throat and lifted him to his
<br />
feet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now you shall pay for your incompetence!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He released Spartacus, who was grabbed by two SWATbots. 
<br />
Spartacus was too overcome by shock and grief to resist.  The
<br />
SWATbots took him to the edge of the village, where a portable
<br />
roboticizer unit had been set up.  They began to raise the glass
<br />
chamber to place Spartacus inside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly the glass shattered into a thousand shards as
<br />
something passed through it at incredible speed--something
<br />
indistinct excerpt for its color.  It was a deep blue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it was didn't stop as it ricocheted off one SWATbot
<br />
after another with sufficient force to knock it to pieces.  The
<br />
SWATbots found it impossible to target the object in order to
<br />
blast it.  None of the badgers could follow it with their eyes.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, all of the SWATbots lay in pieces on the forest
<br />
floor.  The blue blur came to a stop a few feet in front of
<br />
Sophocles.  It was Sonic.  Sophocles swiftly took up a nearby
<br />
battle-ax.  Sonic simply fixed a stare filled with hate at
<br />
Sophocles.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take your best shot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sophocles raised the battle ax above his head.  The instant
<br />
he did, however, Sonic went into spin mode and ran not just into
<br />
but through Sophocles' body.  And now the badgers could see that
<br />
Sophocles was no badger, but a replicant--a mechanical likeness. 
<br />
The body twitched and sparked and leaked hydraulic fluid onto the
<br />
ground.  Sonic returned to the body, took the battle ax from
<br />
Sophocles, said: &quot;This one's for Acorn!&quot;, cut off the replicant's
<br />
head and drop-kicked it into a nearby fire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badgers were silent as Sonic looked around him.  &quot;Don't
<br />
everybody thank me at once!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He might as well have said: &quot;Don't anybody thank me at all,&quot;
<br />
for that's just what the badgers did.  They paid no attention to
<br />
Sonic.  Instead, they looked to another elder of the clan, named
<br />
Eumenides.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We must leave this place.  We will establish a new home in
<br />
the Great Forest.  Let us be off.  Leave no trace.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately, silently, the badgers began gathering their
<br />
weapons and their household goods, dismantling their lodges and
<br />
extinguishing their fires.  Sonic couldn't believe it!  He turned
<br />
to Spartacus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus' eyes--eyes full of anguish--met Sonic's.  In his
<br />
hand, Spartacus held a small hatchet, its blade dulled with fresh
<br />
blood.  And across his chest a fresh scar bled freely.  Then, as
<br />
if there were nothing more to say, he bent down next to Diana and
<br />
helped to bury his brother.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stayed in the clearing for the entire five minutes it
<br />
took for the badgers to break camp.  Spartacus, with Diana
<br />
leaning on his arm, was the last to leave.  He looked back at
<br />
Sonic as if to say something, then turned away.  Sonic was left
<br />
alone, surrounded by pieces of SWATbots and by the graves of the
<br />
badger dead, buried where they had fallen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sound could be heard inside the hut except for the
<br />
scratch of a pencil on paper.  Sally was at work decoding a
<br />
message from Uncle Chuck.  When she had finished, she took the
<br />
piece of paper and went outside.  The first person she saw was
<br />
Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know where Sonic is, Tails?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh-huh.  He's at the pond.  You want me to get him?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I want to talk to him myself.  I just got a message
<br />
from Uncle Chuck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think it'll cheer him up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hope so, honey.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally found Sonic sitting by the pool, looking at nothing in
<br />
particular.  Just as he'd been doing for most of the past seven
<br />
days, ever since he walked sullenly back into Knothole with his
<br />
account of the fight in the badger village.  Sally sat down next
<br />
to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I just received a reply to my message from Uncle
<br />
Chuck.&quot;  Sonic continued staring at the pond, as if he hadn't
<br />
heard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He says that according to the computer records he was able
<br />
to search, a badger answering the description of Sophocles was
<br />
apprehended by SWATbots three months ago.  And he reports that
<br />
Robotnik had indeed prepared a replicant to take his place in the
<br />
clan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic continued ignoring Sally.  She seated herself directly
<br />
in front of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, this means that Robotnik fooled all of us, including
<br />
the badgers of the clan.  He must have wanted to infiltrate the
<br />
clan, win them over by persuasion, and have the makings of an
<br />
army of roboticized badgers at his command.  You broke up his
<br />
plan just in time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic continued to ignore her as he simply sat and stared. 
<br />
Sally realized that Sonic wasn't about to reply.  She decided to
<br />
sit next to him.  He'd talk when he was ready, which was a couple
<br />
of minutes later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, I...I can't figure out why.  I thought we could be
<br />
friends again, like when we were kids.  He must have known about
<br />
the smoke bomb.  I...we were supposed to be friends.  Why did he
<br />
do it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know, Sonic.  The Sophocles replicant probably
<br />
convinced him that what he was doing was for the good of the
<br />
clan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sal, that's a bogus reason to do anything like....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like betray a friend?&quot;  Sonic nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe to us it is, but I think I know what he must have
<br />
been going through.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, yeah?  How?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Remember, I grew up being told that I'd one day have to
<br />
make decisions that would affect all of Mobius.  Even in
<br />
Knothole, Julayla wouldn't let me forget.  Believe me, it's not
<br />
as easy as it looks.  I don't think it was any easier for
<br />
Spartacus, either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get real, Sal!  It's not the same thing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When you get right down to it, it is.  It all comes down to
<br />
making choices.  And some are more difficult than others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally got to her feet.  &quot;Come on, let's rejoin the others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, Sonic got to his feet and began walking with
<br />
Sally back to Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sal, you never told me you knew how to wrestle like
<br />
that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reply, Sally hooked her right arm around Sonic's left
<br />
arm, and swept his left leg out from under him with her right. 
<br />
They both fell backwards onto the ground, but while Sonic was
<br />
still recovering from the surprise Sally sprang to her feet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You never asked,&quot; she said.  Then laughing like a
<br />
schoolgirl, she began running back toward Knothole.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, so you want to play!&quot;  Sonic got to his feet and
<br />
prepared to run rings around the Princess.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!  Sally!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Tails, heading toward them from Knothole.  From the
<br />
tone of his voice, Sonic knew something was wrong.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's up, big guy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The bridge.  Hurry!&quot; was all Tails said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic didn't waste time with further questions, but sped
<br />
toward the bridge.  When he got there, he stopped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A small cluster of freedom fighters stood near the end of
<br />
the bridge.  On the other side across the river stood a stranger.
<br />
This was an alarming development, since Knothole was supposed to
<br />
be a secret.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the figure at the far end of the bridge just stood
<br />
there.  And he wasn't a stranger to everyone there.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Spartacus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sally, there was something intensely sad about him; he
<br />
looked smaller and more vulnerable than when she had seen him
<br />
before.  He had two hatchets hanging from his belt and held a
<br />
battle ax in his hand, but the battle ax trailed behind him like
<br />
the tail of a wounded animal.  In fact, that was the word that
<br />
flashed across Sally's mind as she looked at him: wounded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, however, bristled at the sight of him.  Pushing his
<br />
way through the crowd of freedom fighters gathered at the near
<br />
side of the bridge--a discourtesy he had never shown before--he
<br />
strode across the bridge.  Sally, sensing what was about to
<br />
happen, motioned for Bunnie to follow her back to her hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do YOU want?&quot; Sonic asked Spartacus.  There was no
<br />
mistaking the contempt in his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer, Spartacus knelt on the ground before Sonic, a
<br />
gesture no badger would make to any other animal.  &quot;Your
<br />
forgiveness.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think you can get off that easy?  You sold me and my
<br />
friends out to Robuttnik, or you TRIED to!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know; I don't deserve...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What I deserve is the Fathead of the Year Award, for
<br />
thinking we were still friends.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, please....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You KNEW there was a smoke bomb in that bag!  You KNEW that
<br />
Robuttnik was looking for us!  And you still acted like...like we
<br />
were still buds!&quot; Sonic's voice began to choke up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I admit I knew about the bomb, but...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No 'buts.'  Get out of here and go back to the rest of the
<br />
badgers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean, you can't?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...I've renounced the clan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's this supposed to be, another scam?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is no trick, Sonic.  I've renounced my ties to the
<br />
badgers of our clan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I suppose that made Diana real happy!&quot; he said
<br />
sarcastically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was for her sake that I did it.  The clan elders were
<br />
preparing to denounce our family as sympathizers with the House
<br />
of Acorn.  My self-imposed exile was the only way to prevent
<br />
that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gimme a break!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the truth!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So now you found us.  What're you gonna do, rat on us to
<br />
Robuttnik the first chance you get?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How...how can I trust you anymore?  I've got a whole
<br />
village full of people here I've come to trust.  And if I thought
<br />
there was a chance of you betraying us one more time, I swear
<br />
I'd....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic let the sentence go unfinished, not only because he
<br />
struggled with what he was going to say--that he would kill
<br />
Spartacus himself to keep him from betraying Knothole--but
<br />
because he noticed that Spartacus' expression had changed.  He no
<br />
longer looked forlorn and helpless; now he looked like he had
<br />
just seen a ghost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned around and followed Spartacus' gaze.  The crowd
<br />
of freedom fighters gathered at the other side of the bridge
<br />
parted and Sally walked through them.  But this was a Sally Sonic
<br />
had never seen before...or, if he had, it was only in his dreams.
<br />
She wore a long blue hooded robe lined with scarlet and
<br />
embroidered with gold thread.  The wind caught the cape and
<br />
swirled it around, and Sonic could see that embroidered on the
<br />
back as well as over the heart was the symbol of the planet
<br />
Mobius: a serpent embowed about to bite its own tail.  On her
<br />
head was a simple golden tiara.  These were items that Sally
<br />
hadn't planned on wearing until her coronation, but she wore them
<br />
now with a gravity that filled everyone with awe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally approached the two, then brushed past Sonic as if he
<br />
weren't there.  She looked hard at Spartacus and said nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean you're...?&quot; Spartacus began.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are addressing Sally Alicia, Princess Royal of the
<br />
House of Acorn and heir to the throne of Mobius.&quot;  It was the
<br />
formal language of the court.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus was at a loss for words.  &quot;Princess, I...I didn't
<br />
know....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Silence!  You sought to deliver the Princess Royal into the
<br />
hand of our enemies.  Your actions have been treasonous.  How do
<br />
you plan to atone?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus said nothing.  He reached to draw an axe from his
<br />
belt and several Mobians gasped.  Yet Spartacus offered the axe,
<br />
handle first, to Sally, before kneeling on the ground before her
<br />
with head bowed low.  He bared his neck in the process.  Just as
<br />
suddenly, without saying a word, Sally raised the axe and brought
<br />
it down with a resounding thud...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...an inch from the badger's head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please get up,&quot; Sally said gently as she touched Spartacus'
<br />
shoulder.  The badger lifted his head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You were ready to give your life to prove your sincerity,
<br />
and I accept the offer.  You have a home here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus rose to his feet.  &quot;If you wish it,&quot; Sally
<br />
continued, &quot;we can get a message to the new badger settlement for
<br />
Diana, telling her that you are well and that you have joined our
<br />
fight against Robotnik.  Your mother shouldn't have to mourn the
<br />
loss of both her sons.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you,&quot; he whispered.  &quot;I only wish I knew of a way to
<br />
persuade the other badgers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's only one way: by fighting together against
<br />
Robotnik, we'll prove the elders wrong.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made their way toward Sonic, still standing dumbfounded
<br />
at the end of the bridge.  &quot;Until we can find you permament
<br />
quarters,&quot; Sally said, &quot;you'll need to lodge with one of our most
<br />
experienced freedom fighters: Sonic the Hedgehog.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, Sal, I don't think I...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll learn!&quot; Sally snapped.  Without another word, she
<br />
strode back across the bridge, passed the stunned freedom
<br />
fighters who had gathered on the far side, entered her hut and
<br />
closed the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Quick,&quot; she said to Bunnie once she was inside, &quot;tell me
<br />
what they're doing?  I can't bear to look.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, neither of them are saying anything.  They're just
<br />
kinda lookin' around.  Now Sugar-hog is saying something Ah can't
<br />
make out, and Spartacus is sayin' somethin' back, and now Sonic
<br />
is saying something.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute.  Now they're crossing the bridge. 
<br />
Together.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed with relief and let herself lean backwards
<br />
against the door.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You wanna tell me what the hoo-ha you were doin' out
<br />
there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I remembered something I said to Sonic a while ago: that I
<br />
should have trusted his taste in friends.  Something told me that
<br />
Sonic would never have befriended a badger who was an undying
<br />
enemy of the House of Acorn.  I needed to know for myself, and to
<br />
demonstrate to Sonic, that that was so.  So I put these on to
<br />
gauge Spartacus' true feelings.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Ah'm just glad to see Sugar-hog not lookin' like he'd
<br />
lost his best friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He almost had.  Now help me out of these things.  I really
<br />
don't feel comfortable wearing them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you ask me, Sally-girl, they fit you perfect.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE END
<br />
