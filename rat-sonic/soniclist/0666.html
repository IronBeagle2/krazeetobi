<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 7
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was difficult to say whether any day in Robotropolis was
<br />
a &quot;good day.&quot;  It was difficult enough to tell if it was day at
<br />
all.  A pall of pollution perpetually hung over the city,
<br />
produced by Robotnik's various factories and generators.  To
<br />
fight against this darkness, lights blazed continually across the
<br />
city.  The result was that the city knew neither day nor night in
<br />
the accepted sense; instead, it existed in a sick, perpetual
<br />
twilight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it wasn't easy to say whether any day was a good day in
<br />
Robotropolis, but for one of its two human inhabitants, it was
<br />
shaping up to be a very bad day indeed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had started out well enough for Snively, nephew of Dr.
<br />
Robotnik and now his longsuffering lackey.  The day before had
<br />
been the day to test a new development: a &quot;whisper technology&quot;
<br />
filter that could be retrofitted to Robotnik's hover units.  With
<br />
the filters in place, the hover units would be almost completely
<br />
silent.  With this advantage, it was thought that Robotnik could
<br />
get the drop on the Knothole freedom fighters once and for all. 
<br />
Even Robotnik's arch-nemesis, Sonic the Hedgehog, would be caught
<br />
completely off guard.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was Snively's hope, and it appeared that that hope
<br />
would be realized.  The onboard camera recorded the hover unit's
<br />
approach to the Great Forest where, somewhere, the freedom
<br />
fighters had their hiding place.  Luckily, there was a fog that
<br />
morning, so Snively let the hover unit come in on instruments. 
<br />
And in another stroke of good fortune, a recent reconaissance
<br />
photo showed something like a lookout post in the area.  And most
<br />
fortunate of all, that morning one of the Knothole freedom
<br />
fighters--the files showed that her name was Bunnie--was filmed
<br />
on infrared climbing onto the platform, completely unaware of the
<br />
hover unit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was too much of a temptation to pass up.  Snively
<br />
ordered that the hover unit with its compliment of eight SWATbots
<br />
should pull up to the platform, take Bunnie prisoner and return
<br />
to base.  This would be a crowning moment: a successful test of
<br />
the hover technology would be sweet enough, but the capture of
<br />
one of the Knothole renegades would be even sweeter.  Snively
<br />
watched with mounting glee as he switched to the outboard camera,
<br />
recording the first SWATbot's moves to apprehend Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then something went very, very wrong.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next thing Snively knew, all eight SWATbots had left the
<br />
ship but none had returned.  He set all cameras to record what
<br />
was happening and watched the monitors as best he could.  It was
<br />
apparent that the weight of the SWATbots had collapsed a portion
<br />
of the platform, but that only accounted for some of the eight
<br />
bots going offline.  Something had happened to the others,
<br />
something that was so unplanned for and that happened so fast
<br />
that it served to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Snively realized that all eight SWATbots were offline,
<br />
he quickly scanned the forest floor.  There was not enough room
<br />
for the hover unit to maneuver and with the fog he wasn't able to
<br />
see as much as he'd wanted to.  He thought he recorded an image
<br />
of Bunnie on the ground, either unconscious or dead, but the fog
<br />
made positive identification hopeless.  There was nothing left to
<br />
do but to manually recall the empty hover unit and examine the
<br />
film.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively had just finished doing so and, still not quite
<br />
believing what he had seen, was on his way to report the news to
<br />
Dr. Robotnik.  This was not, he said to himself, going to be a
<br />
good day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the threshold of Robotnik's briefing room he paused to
<br />
make sure his clothes were in order.  No point compounding
<br />
ineptitude with shabbiness.  He stepped inside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've read your preliminary report,&quot; Robotnik said in a low
<br />
rumble of a voice, which came out as a kind of growl.  &quot;Why did
<br />
you fail me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It wasn't quite a failure, Sir.  The whisper technology on
<br />
the hover unit worked beyond all expectations of....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't care about the whisper technology on the hover
<br />
unit; I want to know what happened to my SWATbots!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y-yes, Sir.  Beginning analysis of surveillance film, Sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The image from the film filled a large screen at one end of
<br />
the room.  The image was a little grainy and monochrome, but it
<br />
clearly showed Bunnie climbing the rope ladder, unaware of the
<br />
hover unit not far from her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the sight of her, Robotnik clenched the fist of his own
<br />
roboticized left arm.  He didn't like any of the freedom
<br />
fighters, least of all the hedgehog, but the sight of Bunnie
<br />
particularly vexed him.  She represented unfinished business.  He
<br />
*hated* unfinished business.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The film rolled on, the camera drawing closer and closer to
<br />
the unsuspecting Bunnie.  There was a jump in the film as the
<br />
outboard camera clicked in.  They could see the first SWATbot
<br />
advancing towards Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a blur as someone or something dropped down behind
<br />
the bot.  The shadowy figure could then be seen holding a tree
<br />
branch and swinging it at the bot.  The SWATbot's head came away
<br />
from its body cleanly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a second SWATbot stepped into the camera, obscuring the
<br />
sight of the figure.  But not for long; the figure was soon
<br />
visible again, through a hole punched into the bot's midsection. 
<br />
The bot then crumbled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other bots filled the camera's field of vision, though most
<br />
of them dropped out of the picture as the platform section they
<br />
were standing on gave way beneath their collective weight.  The
<br />
shadowy figure, on the other hand, appeared to be dangling from a
<br />
rope around its waist.  It seemed to make a grab at someone,
<br />
Bunnie probably, but could not hold on.  The image was lighted by
<br />
a SWATbot blast, and the figure swung out of camera range.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The camera followed her with an unsteady movement.  By the
<br />
time it settled on her, there were two SWATbots standing in front
<br />
of her and two more in pieces at her feet.  Maybe three seconds
<br />
had passed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik studied the view screen, his brow furrowing above
<br />
his dark eyes.  Suddenly he sat upright.  The figure on the
<br />
screen had shed her cape, but had left her veil and headdress in
<br />
place.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!  Freeze that image!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rushing to the controls, Snively halted the action on
<br />
screen.  The figure was a blur, but some things could be made
<br />
out: it wore a belt from which hung a number of objects, only a
<br />
few of them recognizable to Robotnik.  She also wore boots, which
<br />
were little better than yards of rags wrapped around her feet.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there was that right arm.  Even on the surveillance
<br />
film it was clear to tell that it was a robot arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!  Enhance the view of that arm!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right away, Sir.&quot;  He adjusted the controls and the image
<br />
was blown up to twice its size.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Larger, Snively!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Sir, we're starting to lose resolution as it is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik studied the image for a few silent seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind, then,&quot; he said with a casual air that stunned
<br />
Snively.  &quot;Continue showing the film.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y-yes Sir.&quot; Bewildered, Snively complied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only took another five seconds for the figure to disable
<br />
the last two bots: the first bot had one of its legs torn off,
<br />
and the other crumpled after a maneuver that caused both Robotnik
<br />
and Snively to wince in pain.  Then she was gone.  The last
<br />
minute of the film was only surveillance of a foggy, and
<br />
apparently empty, forest.  Snively hated to see the film end, for
<br />
he knew that the wrath of Robotnik was sure to follow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively,&quot; Robotnik said calmly, &quot;continue surveillance on
<br />
that part of the Great Forest and inform me if anyone comes to
<br />
rebuild that platform.  You may go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stunned, Snively was not about to question his good fortune.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Very good, Sir,&quot; he said snappily, and left.  Amazed at having
<br />
survived the briefing in one piece, Snively thought that maybe
<br />
this was going to be a good day after all!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the conference room, Robotnik spent the next half-
<br />
hour playing and replaying the film.  At the end of that time he
<br />
was certain of what he had seen.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; he mused, &quot;it would appear that the little princess is
<br />
back, and in one piece.&quot;  He began to consider how best to deal
<br />
with this unfinished business.  He *hated* unfinished business!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
