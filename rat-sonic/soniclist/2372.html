<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I was typing this article out, I was noticing that the majority of the

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over the fact that Satan's child, a.k.a. Bill Clinton, who may be defiling

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the oval office with his presence but was never and will never be my

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; president, (Rush Limbaugh is, you damn fools!!!) has signed the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Telecomunications Bill that makes cybersmut a crime and demands Violence
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chips on TVs.  You might think that I'm joining in on this &quot;party,&quot; because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; some of my pages are black, expecially the ones with the big pictures of my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; artwork on it.
</em><br />

<br />
Mine are black, to protest against censorship, which is Bad.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They are *not* black for the above reason.  They are black so you can see the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pics better.  No other.
</em><br />

<br />
As with my Transformerspage, to give the black TF look.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I find myself IN FAVOR of *somebody* controlling the availability of material
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hazordous to minors on the Net (That's *smut* you dumb_at_$$!!), because I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; believe that there is just too much Sexual Material crammed into their lives
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; all at once.  Whatever happening to having fun, just making friends, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; getting to *know* your net.lover before you go to the back seat of your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 486DX2-66?  Surely Nodoby on the net will pass a law to outlaw *that*!!!  I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; will discuss this further later on in American Kitsune.
</em><br />

<br />
No smut is going to jump up on their screens. You have to actively search 
<br />
for it. OTOH, what is bad is censorship. Especially trying to censor an 
<br />
international medium. A net.lover is a completely different thing than a 
<br />
picture.
<br />
Is AK a fanfic of yours?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would like to assure to my little rest stop on the Information Superhighway
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the Telecomuniation Bill *will not in any way* affect this page.  I do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not allow such crap to even touch my page, and therefore do not have anything
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for whoever's playing net.police raise a stink about.  The same goes for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rat.org, now that the hentai ('Perverts' to those who aren't in Anime)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; department was removed, half a year before this Bill.  The same goes for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; remainer of the Sonic Pages.  We're not www.playboy.com here.  We're just a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bunch of guys and gals discussing a Video Game universe for Pete's Sake!  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a network the size of the entire cosmos, to boot!!  You think that anyone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outside our little world *cares*?  I don't.
</em><br />

<br />
I don't care at all what people do in 
<br />
alt.binaries.pictures.erotica.bestiality.hamsters.duct-tape, and noone 
<br />
should. It's their business, and on the net you mind you own business. If 
<br />
you drag your kids online, then you have to take responsibility for them.
<br />
I think I'll put up a page with the images from the perv directory, once 
<br />
I find them all, just for the Pete of it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The average Joe Cyberjock will not be affected by the Telecommunications bill
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which is trying to keep NC-36 rated crap from people who don't need it in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their lives.  All this laments of censorship is just hysterical parinoia
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; brought on by pinko commie liberals with tiny minds who think primarily with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their penises.  They can have their little pics of doing dogs and naked ugly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; performance artists with a bullwhip in their anus.  I just don't want them,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the same goes for most of my fans!!!  That's all.  The Net is NOT dead!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Long live the Net!!!   And The FoxFire Studios will still be trucking down
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Information Superhighway, no matter *what* Exon will think about it.
</em><br />

<br />
This is quite a fatal blow to freedom and the net. Most of the most-read 
<br />
groups on the net are in fact groups with either the word &quot;sex&quot; or 
<br />
&quot;erotica&quot; in them, and the most searched-for word in the Web search 
<br />
engines are &quot;sex&quot;. It isn't their business what people do with their 
<br />
computers. Hopefully, the saying &quot;Internet interprets censorship as 
<br />
damage and routes around it.&quot;. There are still many countries and servers 
<br />
from which you may post your pictures and stories, so this will only make 
<br />
the people it wants ti get to go underground or route around it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Remember:  The only way to stop me is to kill me, and if I'm dead tomorrow,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clinton did it.

Nah. Never liked the Crocket guy.
