<br />
Considering how many planets there are, it seems inevitable that at least 
<br />
one other is supporting life.  Perhaps (probably?) not life as we know 
<br />
it, but still life.  Although some out there disagree, no one on Earth 
<br />
has encountered extra-terrestrial life, and without a standard for 
<br />
comparison, we can't really say what would be life that is not as we know it.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But what makes me believe that Mobius is part of another universe primarily
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fact that pure magic (the Time Stones, the Chaos Emeralds) exists.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; At the same time, however, I like to believe that the universe that Mobius
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; exists in is parallel in many aspects to our own, and that Mobius is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that universe's Earth.  Mobius and Earth share many of the same animal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and plant species (albeit at different points of evolution), they have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; chili dogs :-), and, assuming that we're not hearing translations, even use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the same languages.
</em><br />

<br />
It seems unlikely that another planet in this or another universe would 
<br />
have developed both English and French in a form so close to what we know 
<br />
-- and that Sonic would even identify Antoine as from the French section 
<br />
of Mobius.  For that to hold true, there would have to be a France on 
<br />
Mobius with the same language and culture (remember Snively torturing 
<br />
Antoine with escargot and margarine?).  That close a parallel is so 
<br />
unlikely that Sonic would probably have mean to draw for us a comparison 
<br />
we can understand to a place on Mobius quite similar to what we know as 
<br />
France.
<br />

<br />
As for translations, we do hear the voices of Jaleel White, Charlie 
<br />
Adler, etc., not the voices of Sonic, Snively, etc.  So maybe those are 
<br />
translations after all.  And the other choice would have been subtitles 
<br />
(which I don't think would have done much for ABC's ratings).  But then, 
<br />
we'll need to track down who on Earth learned their language so that we 
<br />
can all learn it too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another thing that makes me dismiss the idea of a future Earth is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HUGE improbability that many species on Earth could evolve from where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are now into sentient beings in just under 2000 years, nuclear accident
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutations or not.  So far it's taken humans 2.5 million years!
</em><br />

<br />
There's one more thing to remember about time.  Even on Earth, not 
<br />
everyone considers it to be 1995.  There are some cultures who use their 
<br />
own calendar and consider the current year to be something else, although 
<br />
they do use 1995 when communicating with the rest of the world.
<br />

<br />
So who says 3730 on Mobius couldn't be 19xx (or even 18xx) on Earth?  It 
<br />
all depends on when you want to start counting, and Mobius probably has 
<br />
its own special event from not quite 4000 years ago to begin counting from.
<br />

<br />
And then we can get into the question of whether it takes approximately 
<br />
365.25 Earth days or xxx Mobius days for Mobius to revolve once around 
<br />
its sun.  Or does it orbit at all?  We know Knothole had a big snowstorm, 
<br />
so Mobius probably does tilt on its axis towards/away from its sun.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And now for something completely tasteless...
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if Sonic has ever eaten any of his friends when he had chili
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dogs.  Is that why we don't see Porker Lewis in the Archie comics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;shudder&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
I never could see a name, but a pig is in Sally's mini-series #1.  But of 
<br />
course Sonic isn't, except in the intro and the adverts.  And he could be 
<br />
eating one of those artificial 'dogs where probably no one is quite sure 
<br />
what the thing is made of.
<br />

<br />
But as long as you had to bring up a tasteless point....
<br />

<br />
He may just be eating those who were about to (for whatever reason) 
<br />
defect to Robotnik's side.
<br />

<br />
I guess everyone has a few skeletons in the closet, and Mobius is no 
<br />
exception.
