<br />
Back to eliminate any more rumors about Sonic...
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Kiken here, um, which Saturn Sonic game?  There are three on the way.
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, there is one definite.  Sonic Fighters will probably be released 
<br />
in Japan (release in the States &amp; Europe is still under debate).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;V Sonic:  Being programmed by the same members of Sonic Team (Japan) who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  programmed the Mega CD version, which oddly enough means that Yamaguchi
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Yasashi-san will probably be in charge (instead of Naka Yuji-san).
</em><br />

<br />
No word on this one.  Folks around here believe you must be misinformed.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Fighting Sonic:  Being programmed by the absolute deity of 3D, Suzuki
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  Yu-san of Sega Enterprises' AM2.  True, the arcade release will be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  first, but SOJ did announce the home version.
</em><br />

<br />
SOJ might have announced a home version, but that will be for Japan only. 
<br />
&nbsp;The debate is still going on whether we will bring it to the States or not. 
<br />
&nbsp;It will probably be solved after the E3 Show in mid-May.
<br />

<br />
By the way, why do you refer to them as Last name First name Mr. (Suzuki 
<br />
Yu-san, for example)?  That is an incorrect way to refer to someone.  It's 
<br />
like saying &quot;Smith Mr. Joe&quot;
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;3D Sonic (tentative title):  Programmed by team Sega Tech (SOA).  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  same team who prgrammed Sonic Spinball and Sonic 3.
</em><br />

<br />
How wrong you are!  First, it was never referred to as 3D Sonic.  The 
<br />
tentative title is Sonic X-treme.  Second, none of the same members who did 
<br />
Sonic Spinball or Sonic 3 (two different teams for the most part) are 
<br />
working on Sonic X-treme.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, anyway, make sure that Sonic doesn't get dumped.  I know that Sega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Enterprises (Japan) have been rumored (hopefully, that's all it is) that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they will ease Sonic out of the spotlight in the near future.  Chances
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are that VF2 has something to do with that.  After all, there's a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continuous running anime series based on VF2, while Sonic was only given a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;two part OVA release.  Hmmmmm.
</em><br />

<br />
Again, Sega letting Sonic fade away would be like Disney letting Mickey 
<br />
Mouse fade away.  Not gonna happen.
<br />
VF2 is HUGE in Japan, while it is only carries a moderate appeal here. 
<br />
&nbsp;Sonic is big in both Japan and the States.  There's plenty of room for both 
<br />
to co-exist peacefully.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;-Mike
<br />
