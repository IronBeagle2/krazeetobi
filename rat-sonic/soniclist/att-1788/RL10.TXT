Hello everyone, well here it is my Sonic story. Though I would like
to tell you before you read it that there are a few things I didn't like,
for one Sonic didn't speak enough, and the story couldn't be modified
to give him big scenes. :-(

But, the rest of the story is pretty good, so READ on.

                     RL10- Tortured Freedom by Simon Howes
******************************************************************************

"The universe is so dark and evil" Jonathan Righter thought to himself
that night as he stood in the communications room, staring out at the stars.
"And" he added, "..so unpredictable.."

It was the Earth year 1997, though he was standing amass technology so 
advanced that it would take his homeworld some one and a half thousand years
to achieve it. He smirked as a ship raced by in the void outside the huge 
three meter perspex window of the base he was on. 

This was GRB-II, "Guardians of the Reality, base two.."  Though it was based
on GRB-I it had a few major revisions. For instance this was a starbase, 
while the original was a planetary base, this base was outfitted with shields,
had fifty-eight fighter ships, two-hundred and ninety six weapons turrets,
four thousand seven hundred and fifty three warheads onboard, was outfitted
with a main weapon capable of tearing a small moon in half, and could
detect a ship all the way across the galaxy.

Yep, the GR didn't want a repeat of GRB-I to occur, he dropped his eyes. 
That evening four years ago was still locked in his brain, and haunted 
his dreams. 

Back then he was still a rooky, flying small missions to all parts of the
universe. Nothing really big or exciting ever really happened, until
on one return flight he came back to the smoldering remains of
what the Cinz had left of his base. There were few survivors, from a group
of six-hundred only a dozen remained. 

He'd sworn revenge, heading back to a bar in RL8, finally the truth dawned
on him. The Cinz yolk now ruled the universe, and those who supported the
GR were rebels.

"So be it", he said, joining up with others sharing his view, they made a
suicidal attack run on the Epsilon Mysadness system. An attack that went 
down in history as the day the rebels became the law. 

Not long after that , he came into a confrontation with the Cinz emperor, 
Mmmammaris. 
And in a cold battle of bitter revenge he drove a shard of crystal through
it's heart. Before the last drop of blood had fallen, the dying emperor had
a chance to hurt once more. "By CALA, we will be victorious!"
And with that he died, striking a blow to the human's heart that could never
be healed.

A blow that drove him on further, made him cold, even at times as evil as the
Cinz in the quest for revenge. Once he had found a Cinz nursery, and 
destroyed it--with little regard for emotion and in an atire that would make 
Mmmammaris himself shirk. He coldly destroyed Cinz ships feeling no pain,
nor gaining no pleasure from it. He ravaged Cinz planets, throwing every
weapon at his power down on them below, coldly killing the empire.
His weapon accuracy was so high from the killing of the 116 he personally
had overseen, that he could take a leaf out at a range of three hundred 
meters with his pistol, and there was more.. he seeked them out wherever
they hid, no matter who they were, peacefull or hostile. To him, if they
were Cinz.. they were his responsibilty. At times they even begged for mercy,
mercy that he delivered quickly, coldly and effectively--with super-ionized 
gas.

Yet, this was not him, his friends always knew his as a caring, soft,
honourable person. The same person who had titled the RL god "Cala" 
seven years ago. "Computerised Advanced Linear Accelarator", extremely
crude and very far off, and he was the only one who knew that, everyone
else used the name without ever knowing what it meant.

But he knew CALA was a computer, it's logics unknown, and it's boards
forever hidden. It was a moderator, it chopped and spliced situations
with it's particle tools. It could make madmen out of hydrogen and flesh 
out of dust. In it's own way.. it was a god.

And like a god, it had it's own stars, it's own worlds and realities--this
very area of space he was now in was dubbed RL8. Which stood for "reality-
level eight"  A place of high technology that even when removed from 
'Cala-space' would remain functioning. 

The other realities all had their own odd attributes, depending on the
involvement "Cala" had in them, the lower the reality level. In reality
level one, you might find yourself stretching lakes around, like in some
mad cartoon, while in Rl9, life was very much 'Real.'

RL10, was called the untouched reality, this included Earth, and all areas
of space Cala didn't control. Whether Cala left them, or couldn't control
them it would never be known. 

He glared out into the void, one of those stars out there somewhere was Sol,
his home system. It's exact spacial co-ordinates he would never know, after
all he travelled to and from Earth via a gateway.. or the science-fiction
classic a port'al.

He turned his head to get more of a view, so many stars, but out of all of
RL10, he knew of only one race.. the humans.. Whatever or whoever had built
the moderator would never be known to him, "besides" he though, there were
more important things to do--like cleaning the galaxy.

******************************************************************************
                           Time : 10:30 AM on GR base 2
******************************************************************************
"Damn", he shouted out, "damnit all to hell", where have those suckering low
swine run to this time, Jonathan slammed the one metre radar screen as if 
though it would reveal where the Cinz ship had so suddenly disappeared to.

Marken, his partner and friend, also from RL10, who had joined him in the 
service of protecting the realities after he had proven their existence to 
him in late 1990, was unable to think of anything to calm his friend down
with. This case was indeed very rare, and the concept of a ship just 
vanishing of a sub-space radar was indeed odd.. in fact, it was almost 
impossible. 

Jon whirled around to face Craig, the super genius, almost super human, brain
of the GR. "Explanation.. if you please, has our antenna dropped off" He found
himself wondering about peering outside to see if it really had, though, they
would have been informed by the computer had that really happened. 

Craig gave a blank stare for a moment, his mind racing through all the 
possibilities, but carefully selecting the most likely. He was from RL9, a 
place of human dominance and incredible technology, also, amazingly a place
that including RL8 was scientifically compatible with RL10, meaning anything
built there could be ported to RL10, and used without the need for CALA to
emulate it. Whereas a RL3 flying machine would probably explode before you
could throttle it enough for takeoff.

Finally, he stopped, nodded his head attracting Jonathan's attention, 
collected his thoughts for a moment then began. "The most likely possibility
is that their ship headed out of CALA's range, or as such into RL10 space."
Then he walked over to the monitor and began explaining, " after all, they
were at the furthest in the sector I have ever known a ship to be in, and
as you already established to us three years ago, CALA throws ships at the
border of CALA RL's at lease fifteen light years away. If you think
about it, it's a kind of protection system really isn't it?" He glanced
back up at the two partners, "I'll bet, that if anything came too close to 
the borders from outside, CALA would toss them just past the border at the
other side, making our place in space eternally hidden."

Jonathan looked blankly up at him, stunned, he could see it now, Earth, his
homeworld shattered by Cinz ships, houses burning, the smell of human flesh
only too common.. "Earth, they may find Earth, we have to stop them!"

Craig reasuringly looked back up at him, trying his best to comfort him,
"Jon your universe is many times larger than ours, with so many combinations
of possibilities that the chances of them ever finding your homeworld would
so minimal that.."

But Jonathan was already running, with Marken tagging behind him, he squeezed
out as he dashed.. "Now or ever, my first loyalty is always to my reality!"

Fifteen minutes later, their ship was spewing it's fiery plasma out as it
blazed to it's jump position, then instantly, as the gravity fields, those 
from nearby stars, and those from his jump drive overlapped one another,
his ship was gone, slingshotted at a speed not capable of being measured, not
by light at least, into the great beyond of realspace.

******************************************************************************
                      Time : 19:00  on the Planet Mobius
******************************************************************************

Robotnik was annoyed again, and nothing he had access to could relieve it,
already he had beaten a few of his earlier model robots into scrap metal with
an iron bar.. However the only result of this was that he had damaged his
wrist and was in fact now even more irratated. To make matters worse he had
a cold, something that he had not thought he could get on this planet, 
apparently the Mobian virus had mutated to be compatible with one of the very
few of his species on the planet that it would effect - him. 

"Suck all the atmosphere away", he mumbled to himself, a plan which he wished
he had initially followed, it was too late now however, as his factories 
had need for that air. Had he only not been so arrogant to assume he could
have taken Mobius without any difficulties, he would be free of that 
blue pest now.

A sick though came to his mind, the hedgehog lying all bloated from the 
effects of the vacuum, an evil smile crossed his face. Even with all the
mechanics latched onto his body, he still retained his ability to
have dreams. 

The door behind him shooshed open, a metallic drone of a service 'bot, he 
had once designed, echoed out to him. "..Sir..is..there..anything..I..can..get 
..for..you.."  

He pushed the button on his chair and reeled round to face the bulk of junk, 
"actually there is something, I would like one hedgehog, on a plate."

The baffled droid responded, "I..am..very..sorry..sir..your..order..cannot..
be..completed..now..as..I..have..no..ingredients..of..type..hedgehog.."
He interrupted it, with a short question, "why not?"
 
The droid, reeled for a moment to adjust it's servos that were slipping under
it's own weight. "..sir..you..either..robotized..or..killed..all..hedgehogs..
we..have..ever..had....except..for..one..that.."
He didn't want to hear anymore about Sonic, "Destroy yourself" he dictated.

And the droid tore itself to pieces with it's own servos, but from it he
gained little pleasure, just the stopping of that terrible word that 
haunted his days and destroyed his factories by night.

******************************************************************************
        Time 19:30 Mobius Time, aboard the Cinz Ship "Eternal Victory"
******************************************************************************

Commander Myponda of the Cinz Ship "Eternal Victory", stood proudly
on the bridge, he talked over the plan again, it was good to hear success,
and even if they had to repeat it to him a hundred times, he would still never
get over that tingling feeling of a soon to come victory. After all he was 
a Cinz warrior, one of the Elite. Victory, success and chivalry 
reined in every particle of his blood.

Sub captain Myroda, spoke to him, like all honourable Cinz pilots, he had
changed his name to begin with an "M" when he had gained his high rank, "M"
a sign of incredible honour.. "Sir, those GR fools cannot stop us now, and.."
he tensed his mandible in a sign of pride, honour and success,
"I was right about sending that probe out nine months ago, for it has 
succesfully found life on a nice planet. Safe in truespace from those GR 
fools, we will be able to build up the ultimate armada there, then sweep back
and show them what real power entails. "

"Excellent, but one thing, what life is there on this planet?" 
Myroda laughed, "our scanners have shown only factories, run by machines, 
and maybe one or two humans, but, these factories are built to make droids!"

Myponda reeled his neck backwards and forwards , the custom way for a high 
ranking officer like himself to show his happiness.

But there was more, "also, sir, forest makes up twenty percent of the planets
land mass.. TWENTY PERCENT SIR!"  Myponda smiled," well, that will 
speed up the process of making it preferable to our needs." He stopped for
a moment, then dictated to Amaropolis, "Have the biological pods prepared
for launch, we'll have need for them after we purge the planet of the 
inferior life that inhabits it."

The Cinz could best be described as "Psycho Gardners", anybody who
knew a Cinz would tell you that they LOVED nature, after all, it was 
part of their honour. Unfortunatly, this honour also said something 
about the Cinz being the rulers of all creatures, sentient, non-sentient,
silicon and plant. So, while they would really fix up the eco-system of 
a planet they took, their was a slight problem for you if you were 
not a Cinz yourself. Though, the Cinz were not cruel, they would give you
two choices, instant painless death, or retro-engineering (A process in
which sentient beings were made non-sentient.) However the GR really
didn't like this at all, after all only 4% of their members were Cinz. 

They crew laughed as their ship neared a few hours at full speed to
what they believed would be their new home.

******************************************************************************
 23:00 Aboard GR Fighter of Jonathan Righter, GR Base 2 Time 
******************************************************************************

Marken and Jonathan sped through space at the fastest speed their
ship could effectively go, they had passed into RL10 just seconds ago, but
their speed still held solid.. "Made in 8" joked Marken as they passed through
into ten without tearing into pieces.. 

Marken targetted a ship some fourteen million blips away, then typing some 
jargon on the keyboard predicted it's destination.. A planet somewhere in 
a constellation they may have never seen, he fiddled a bit more, and a 
jerky wireframe image of a spherical planet came onscreen. Slowly data on it
began being calculated, spin time, 20-30 hours, atmosphere type, "life planet".

Jonathan rubbed the gun he carried on him, then whispered softly, "Earth, they
are going for Earth.. intolerable, for which they must be punished..."

******************************************************************************                              
                                 Time 20:30 Mobius
******************************************************************************

Tails was lying in bed looking up at the stars, Bookshire had told him that
every star, however small it was, probably had planets the size of Mobius
revolving around it. It was hard to consider this, they seemed so small, even
to him, so far, they would never be reachable. Then something caught his eye,
in a constellation he knew only too well by it's shape, there was a new star.

An odd star, not flickering like the others, but staying permanently bright,
it couldn't have been a sattelite, he had seen plenty of them, smoothly
moving across the sky, doing their evil jobs for Robotnik..

Perhaps it was a planet, but, it didn't really matter now, as he drifted off
to sleep, feeling secure with his friends. Unknown to him a ship of mass
destruction bore down on their little world.

Outside Sonic was chuckling to Sally about the new nets that they had 
installed.. he concluded finally as the laughter began dying down, "Yeah, it
sure was nice of old Robuttnik to lend us all those nets.."

Nets all across the forest had beed repositioned by Sonic, and when the 
droids went scouting in the morning to see what they had brought them, they
would be quite amazed.. with any luck Robotnik himself would step in one, 
that and the cold would put him on an all time low.

****************************************************************************** 
                 Time 8:30 Aboard Cinz Ship (Mobius Time)
******************************************************************************

They all looked down on the blue planet, Yes, this would be their new home, 
the gunners locked weapons on the factories, already fifteen sites had been
selected, upon firing, all artificial power sources on Mobius would be shut
down. One of sites included a pond, the commanders sneered, did the fools 
really think they could hide a power source like that.. in a pond, how 
ridiculous!

The ship locked it's weapons, dropped their shields, and began loading 
and arming thermonuclear torpedoes for launch.

******************************************************************************
                             Time 8:32 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Tails had noticed that the star he had seen the night before was still there,
only bigger and brighter than before. Grabbing his binoculars he flew up into
a tall tree to get a better look. 

Was it a planet? The fox's mind boggled at the possibilities, then, all at 
once he realised, it was moving! 

Flying from tree to tree to get a better look at it, he gradually headed 
farther and farther away from the village. 

******************************************************************************
                             Time 8:50 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Myponda looked over the controls, "Okay, open the hatches!"  An adlib voice
echoed. "OPEN!"  Then he smiled, "Check final launch statistics" 
"CHECK!"

He reeled back in morbid desire, "Fire!"

Suddenly there was almighty explosion, Myroda, Myponda, the crew and all  
fifteen armed thermonuclear torpedoes turned to vapour. They had paid the
price for being arrogant, in failing to raise shields or monitor their radars,
Jonathan and Marken had brought their small ship to bear on them, firing a 
single missile. 
Now, where the "Eternal Victory" had sat proudly just a few minutes ago, a 
rapidly expanding show of ionized gas entertained the dead. Jonathan's craft 
sped on rapidly through this gas, an unfortunate result of inertia. The shield
monitors jittered as the occasional piece of debris ablated against the blue
aura two meters away from the ship. 

A clanging resonated through the hull as a huge piece of inactive structure
puffed through the shield, impacted up against the main viewport and fore 
antenna. The perspex window cracked, hissing as the atmosphere tried to 
normalise. The debri, shuddered as it bounced up and went scraping back 
across the top of the hull, tearing cables, antenni and top mounted units of
all kinds into the eternal residence it was promised.
Systems aboard went haywire, the little fighter plummeted towards the
blue-green planet below. On contacting the atmosphere, the collision with
air particles and the fact that shields were inoperative (the generator 
floating around a few kilometers away), caused the GR ship to temporarily
become a ball of fire. In the heat, systems began to malfunction, the 
main plasma engine imploded, sending super ionized gas throughout the ship.

For a microsecond, as it streamed just over his body, the thought of eternal
danger raced in Jonathan, seconds later, there was no trace of him or his 
friend, save a burning comet falling to earth. 

An awestruck Tails watched the display, and excitedly flew towards 
where the ball of fire was heading.

******************************************************************************                             
                               Time 10:30 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
He had flown as fast as he possibly could to get to the crash site in time,
but, by the time it was actually in view, Tails saw it was crawling with 
droids. He abruptly stopped, sat on a branch in a tree and tried to work out
what they were doing.

Through the binoculars he could see them scavenging the mutilated flesh of
machinery that manifested as the engines just minutes before. Then, as one of
the 'bots removed a glowing orb from it, he leaned forwards to get a better
view.

All of a sudden, the new vectors acting on the branch he was on overcame the
weight threshhold, it snapped, and in an instant he was laying on the
floor. The fall had not in fact been fatal, his mass combined with the 
softness of the leaves below reduced most of the impact, leaving him only 
slightly stunned.
But the noise had been sufficient to arouse the droids attention, two of them
raced towards him, frantically he stood up, disoriently running for a 
clearing where he would be able to take off from, not more than meters away.
The droids servos thrashed behind him as their tracks cracked over leaves and
threw up dust. The clearing was less than two meters now, he began 
spinning his tails, and then suddenly there was an immense amount of upward
lift.

But, it was not his, his tails had not even began to produce enough lift to
get him airborne yet, and he was now hanging in one of the net's 
Sonic and he had moved around to play havoc with the droids.

******************************************************************************                             
                           Time 11:30 Mobius 
******************************************************************************
Jonathan stood stunned and shocked on a small hill amongst the grasslands,
alongside him Marken brushed his fingers through his hair, trying to keep 
his normal cool collected image. "Well, I guess 'auto teleport out' was made
in RL8 or we would be so wasted now, kinda like those toasties you make." 
He laughed, but his counterpart couldn't bring himself to share in the humour,
lost in shock and thought he stared off towards the blue horizon. This 
annoyed Marken, he didn't like people who kept to themselves. They 
reminded him too much of how he used to be, before he'd created his
new image. Now, everyone believed he was an open person, and in
a way, this is what he was. If anything bothered him, he would 
disguise it in a joke and post it.. Instant removal of problems.

Finally Jon' rotated his head, he slowly spoke, his voice trembling from the
shock he had had, "we should have died, it was only luck that saved us, do 
you realise that?" Pausing for a moment to allow his rhetorical question to  
detonate he continued "I only just had enough energy to teleport out, if we 
had been just a few hundred meters away..." his throat closed up, choked by
the harsh brutality of reality, he was unable even to make eye-contact, fearing
the pressure around his eyes would relieve itself. He was a man, he would
not expose himself as being like that.

Marken mused, "but, hey, we had a brill pilot.. we were never in danger, 
hey, he intended to do that!" His friend smiled at his joke, but the 
joke-maker himself did not. There had been plenty of times in his life
that he'd cheated death... The attack run on Barotis, if it hadn't been for
that silicon wonder planted in his head he would be just another gas
cloud so common to Cinz space. 

Ah, the "device" as they called it, a wonder of RL8's scientific community.
It basically was a body management system, but to any normal person,
you might as well call it magic, as the electronics inside it were so 
complex that Magic was close to what it was. It supplied a whole series
of features each one responding differently to what RL the user was in.

Yes, the device demonstrated once more their dependance on it, as far back
as he could remember ever since that device was implanted there had never 
been a day he hadn't used it. After all, that was impossible, since it 
dynamically overlayed text on his vision, displayed menus of options, played
back video clips, stored data errorlessly on his brain, and gave him  
abilities ranging from an external shield to a database on recipes. 

But all this didn't matter right now, his friend was far too shocked to do
much, so the first move would be his. Removing a radio from his belt he 
tried to call Paxis (their Earth connection), naturally, due to the fact 
this was not Earth (even though they assumed it was), there was no 
connection at all. He played around with it for a while, but in the end 
decided that it had to do with them being at such a remote location.
This didn't really worry him, encouragingly he spoke his thoughts out loud
in hope of inspiring his friend. "Well, this stupid hill-billy land doesn't 
seem to have any sattelites.. So, I guess we'd better just use a phone."

He obtained the desired effect, Jonathan looked up, then in a recharge of 
will he burst out, "yes, let's find and borrow some nice swedish
farmers phone." Marken looked at him funny, "Geesh, your geographies not
very good is it.. I'm telling you, this is Scotland, look at the hills.."
They chattered on about their ineffectiveness at being human as they 
passed by a rather furry tree and up into the forest.

A few seconds later the tree shook as princess Sally dropped out of it, 
she had been on lookout, when suddenly they had seemed to pop out of nowhere. 
Spies - Robotniks spies, for sure, she'd seen them transmitting information 
to him, pointing, planning, then heading off to scout out the forest.
As she ran towards the forest to warn her allies, she reminded herself to 
keep a better eye out in future..

******************************************************************************
Robotnik's mood had taken a swing for the better, the blue hedgehog was not 
going to be meddling with his plans in future, not if he valued his little friends
life.
Tails hung in a cage suspended from the ceiling, occasionly making feeble 
threats about how Sonic would render bodily harm to him. But to Robotnik, 
there was no immediate danger, for the cage that he had crafted had a series 
of preserving features built in. For one, it was made out of solid titanium, 
no hedgehog would be cutting through it--ever . Secondly, there 
was no doors or locks, the only movable part in it was the base which snapped 
on to the bars, each one acting as a padlock. Finally, and this one he really 
liked, the only way it could be opened was by a code known only to him, 
any other numerical combination he had told Tails would cause a small nuclear 
device housed in the base to detonate. 

Though this wasn't the truth, he preferred not to have easily activated 
nuclear weapons in his near proximity, it served to further tighten the rope 
that he would strangle the blue blurr and his friends with. 
"Yes" he mumbled to himself, today was going to be a good day, he had 
configured a trap that there was no escape from, 
at least not any method concievable to him..

                         Time 12:30 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 
For an hour now they had been walking, the forest seemed to eternally drag on,
making their quest seem all that harder. Marken kept up his encouraging views
of life, making jokes about everything Jonathan could possibly say.  
Jonathan now had given in to the irratation, and simply took the bad 
jokes with the eternal journey. Every now and again though he would make a 
comment in vain attempt to make the babbling torture less by changing the 
subject.

"Mark, we must be miles away from any civilisation" he burst in a 
hyperbolic tone, "where on Earth are we, the Australian wastelands?" 
Like a automatic weapon his friend spat out long streams of fiery replies and 
bad jokes. "Come on, we must be near to something, have you seen any animals
around?" Jonathan hadn't thought about that, these woods were as deserted as
his cupboard on the day before payday, his mind wondered into long thought 
about the enviroment they were wasting so badly on his home planet. 

But his loss in thought was not tolerable to Marken, who's constant streams 
of text once again revived his mind from the pit of serenity. "Just follow 
the smell of pollution Jon. There's carbon monoxide not far off, trust me, my
senses are better than.. than .. than.. Well, whatever, but believe me, I 
notice everything, see everything, smell everything and sometimes I even.."

Almost as in response to his boasting, an unnoticed trap they had sprung now 
levitated them in a net about fifty centimeters above the ground. Marken 
quickly appended a line to his boasts. "See, told you I would find 
civilization!" Jonathan couldn't help laughing at the sheer will his buddy 
had. "Great Mark, now next time, let me do the navigation", he pointed to the
dirty chimneys spewing out smoke across the valley. 

Suddenly however their attention span was pricked by a group of creature not
very native to Earth, standing assertively around them. Jonathan for a moment 
was shocked, "Psantis, I thought we were in RL10?" A blank stare from his 
colleague showed that his thoughts were indeed not altogether unique. He 
looked at the "device's" overlay, as it confirmed they were in true space.
In awe he tried every test that his little onbrain computer had to offer, 
each time being slapped in the face by the same answer- RL 10..

Marken however had already began to initiate communications, whether it was 
RL10 or RL3, it was all reality to him. "Uh hi, I'm Marken Psantis from.."
His speech was cut short as one of the leaders of the biased crowd stepped  
forward and terminated it by begining his own. "Well looky what the hedgehog
dragged in, two of Robuttniks monkeys.." The crowd made happy laughs and 
sarcastic comments, all of which Marken didn't exactly catch. 
He didn't like this potentialy explosive situation, mistaken identity can
be humourous.. at times.. this was not one of them. And looking at those 
splines the blue hedgehog masqueraded one thought came to mind - impalation.
He tapped his shocked comrade on the arm, trying to suggest that he take over
but whether he was busy running diagnostics or just plain scared, he did 
nothing. 

Next, the net delivered them into the merciless hands of the crowd, and ropes
from all around bound the two next to one another. All the way round, right
down to their knees. Then, with a hasty push, the crown maneuvered them 
off towards the unknown. Jonathan, didn't like this situation at all, 
if they were in RL10, and this was Earth, some world-wide constitutions had
sure changed since he was last here. If this wasn't Earth, they were in more
trouble than he had ever imagined.. trapped without ships, lights years away
from ANYTHING.. anything but this. 

Something was hurting him as it rubbed up against his side, he strained under
the ropes to try and move it. Upon contacting it, he realised all at once 
what it was ... his pistol! Squeezing his hand to all flexible limits he
forced it onto the trigger. 

Then the party stopped, the blue hedgehog came forward and began speaking 
to them, whatever he said, neither of the GR men heard. Marken was trying to
get reasonable grasp on the situation to build up a rescuing speech. Jonathan
was trying to find the power/safety button on his pistol. 

Sonic looked at the pitifull servants of Robotniks, squirming, trying not to
look suspicious the blondehead was consumed in his attempt to escape. Sonic
walked over to him and jabbed him in the side, shocked, he looked at him.
His comrade started up, 
"Excuse me Mr Hedgeporcupinepersonniceguyswhostoonicetoconsiderimpalingme,
 but uum, what planet are we on.."
Sonic was baffled, why did they want to know something like that, he was
about to  answer when suddenly a high pitched tone rapidly increasing it's 
frequency emmanated from under the ropes. 

In a burst of light a loud explosion of gas answered the whining, the rope 
around Jonathan exploded. People screamed, diving behind trees to avoid 
crossing the path of that weapon.

As they did, fate revealed the grim testament of what plasma can do to flesh,
Jonathan's right leg was morbidly trimmed, the flesh on his thigh stripped
away. He screamed and realed back, gun harmlessly pointing towards the sky.

To Sonic that was the only opening he needed, thrusting forward he was 
suddenly suprised by the lack of traction. By the time he had realised that
Marken had plucked him up from the ground it was too late, something cold
wrapped around his neck - sending a chill down through his body. 
He desperately tried to struggle, his power being clipped by the 
luminous-pink restrainer collar. 

Marken quickly evaluated the situation, took the gun off his friend and held
it to his captives head. "Look, everyone.." his voice uncertain, "we don't
want any trouble, now.. we're just going to take a little walk off somewhere,
and if you are all good, we'll.. we'll just drop off your friend.. OK?" 
But there was no reponse, so he added his own, "Ok, Ok, so it's cool, we're
just going to drift back off down here. Ok? And.. nothing's going to happen
because we're all cool.. Right? Yeah.. Ok?" 

Jonathan gained support by leaning on his shoulder as they hopped off 
backwards into the trees. After a few meters they came to a path. Mark
dropped Sonic, slipping his hand round the collar, increasing the
power, slowly until his captive was too deep in sleep to cause further
complications.

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 14:30 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan groaned, the leg was a goner, he layed down between the bushes  
looking at the cooked meat. If only the gun had been a few centimeters 
further away, the "device" could have raised shields, if only HE had used the 
gun when they were hanging in the net. But no matter how much he regretted 
the situation, it would have no effect on it. They were in a world where
humans were outlawed, a world from which there could be no possible escape.
Even now, "the device" was running down on energy, soon, as the energy 
orbs situated on the inner of spine discharged, his limited special abilities
would go with it. Starved of food and without allies they would die on this
planet, just like Craig had always said: "you will die in RL10."

Marken Psantis looked over his injured friend and partner, despite his 
advanced medical training, there was no way he could make flesh out of air,
morphing would help, had they sufficient energy to "fusion morph" where
nearby particles are converted into the required substance. But, they didn't,
then energy required to even fuse hydrogen together was so high that only
Cala alone could perform it. 

But, there were alternatives, "Jonathan, what if you transform into something
smaller?" A horrified stare replied, "in RL10, do you realise what that would
be like?" No, he had no idea.. so he let him continue. "While Cala simply 
lets us flash into another form, the RL8 morpher involves physical and 
emphasis on physical morphing... have you ever wondered what it feels like to
have your spine collapse?"

Mark, edged closer, "what other chances do we have", he pointed to the 
scorched leg, "anyhow, in a few days we won't get another chance.." Jonathan
shifted on the floor, letting out a softened cry of agony.. "Well, I guess",
 turning his head away his voice began to tremble, "we have to do what we
have to do.. right?" Mark continued hastily, "well, shall we do it then?" 
"No, we'll be vulnerable for hours, we take it in turns, if anything occurs,
we protect one another or lead off the enemy.. OK?" Psantis stalled for a
moment, "You go first.." pointing to his comrades leg.

A chill ran down his spine, there was no way out, he selected the morph 
command, put up two-orbs for use, leaving the last one, then, "the device"
gave him a list of rotating images, each one the creature he could try change 
into, he let "the device" select for him that which would be the most 
effective. The selected image flashed over his mind too quick for him to
register what had been chosen, and then , a little dialog came up.  

Calculating internal paths..

The percent done slowly increased, every percent freezing his heart more, he
stared at Mark. "Well, I guess this is it.. see you on the other side.."
thirty-two percent. Marken smiled at him, "good luck.." 
Fourty-eight percent, the andrenalin gland that was soon to be rocked pumped
out it's load under the "device's" orders..
Sixty-five percent, heart racing, Jonathan took a deep gulp.
One hundred percent...
For the few seconds the 'device' did it's last calculations, Jonathan gave a
grim smile. 

Then he rolled forward, mouth hanging open, drooling from it as a loud gut 
wrenching snapping from his spine resounded, he dropped face down, tears 
streaking from his eyes. His leg made a crackling sound, and with an abrupt
burst, blood flew up against the bushes as the bottom of the limb detatched
itself. Marken grasped his hand, holding it reassuringly while the crackling
noises of morphing bones like splintering wood continued. Standing on his 
knees, he tried the best he could to comfort his friend. 

Suddenly there was a shout from the distance, "There he is!" He rotated his
exposed head around to see it, they had found him, and they were coming his
way rapidly.. "Jonathan.."   The bloodied body replied, "Go.. leave me.. save
yourself.. "  Mark couldn't, gripping his hand, he pleaded, "Jonathan.." 
But Jonathan had been given the mercy of the gods and did not respond, he 
looked back, they were closer now, then, he felt some of the weight taken 
off his hand... Clutched in his hand was a broken off part of his comrade,
he knew what to do.

Tears of sheer determination raced down his heart as he charged toward the
oncoming. Several darts hit him, but his body kept on, his only goal to lead
them away. As the drug in the darts touched his heart, his body pathetically 
thudded to the ground, his only consolation the rescue of his friend.
For a moment he lay there, before darkness led him down a loomy passage.

****************************************************************************** 

Apart from the white overlay from the 'device' and the little energy-low icon,
the world was silent to Jonathan Righter. Lying on the floor, his eyes closed,
his new body's skin fizzed as it completed the last part of the morph. 
His perception was static and chaos, the neurons in his brain not fully 
rerouted by the 'device' yet.  He had come to the eye in the storm of chaos,
disoriently he stood up, muscles moving incorrectly in spasms. He opened his 
eyes, a luminous bright image came to them, in the far-off distance some 
figure moved. He had to get away from this spot, storing it's coordinates, he
stumbled forth, collapsing some meters away in a bush as the 'device' 
restarted it's configuring process. 

******************************************************************************

****************************************************************************** 

"H.. h.. hh. he's awaking r..r..Robotni.. SIR!"
"I hope so Snively.. for your sake."

He opened his eyes, looking straight up at a metallic ceiling, around him
shadowed forms stood, one less digital than the others. Tired but not beaten
he started the ball rolling, "uh, where am I." 

A man trivially replied,
"why in Robotropolis my boy.."  
"Robotropolis, damn, guess my cellphone won't work here.." 
Robotnik was not amused, he pulled Mark up by the collar quite 
surprising him with his strength, then burnt him with a dark stare. Mark
panicked, "Yip, okay, I get the idea," scanning the room to avoid eye-contact. 

Robotnik held him there, allowing him to notice the plastic restrainer collar 
he had used earlier that day, cutting into his neck. The situation was getting
critical, from what he could tell, this guy was the very very serious type. 

Choking now he spat out, "Ok, I see you want to speak, I seem to have a lot
of time suddenly.. honest.. really.. you know once.." Robotnik jerked him,
"you are the pilot right?" He nodded timidly, with a thump he was thrown
back into the metallic arms of the droids. 

He caught a breath for a moment as the local threat fetched something from
the bottom of the room. This allowed him to make a quick survey of the area,
dark, full of monitors, hyraulic doors, control panels, an empty cage hanging
from the roof. Mmm, cosy, basically a classic mad scientist who would....
Suddenly his thoughts were cut as Robotnik masqueraded a device looking
something like an old SeaGRATE harddrive, "well, pilot, you are going to help
me, you see there is a little a something I want off here.. " The ship's
data backup unit flashed as it was rotated, then stepping closer and undoing 
the collar he smiled evily. "and you are going to help me get it.. "

Marken looked at him for a moment, "uuhm, just one small point I would like
to know.. That scientist..guy..person called you Robotnik earlier, and well, 
uum, you see the people that kinda nabbed me didn't seem to work for you..
So I was wondering, why am I here?" 

Robotnik walked over to the now-empty cage, he had exchanged the fox 
for the curiosity that killed the cat. When Sonic boasted he had a hostage
he had immediatly become interested.. and what a surprise it was.. to have
the pilot of a ship with unknown powers.

He smiled at the pilot, "Well, let's say I did a trade. And I'm about to do
another one.. considering I traded something valuable to save you from
the free.. terrorists, you in exchange are going to give me information to
build the weapons on your ship.."
Marken stared amazed at him, this guy sure was evil, he probed a bit.
"And what if I refuse?"
Robotnik exploded "You ungratefull pest, I saved your life, and this is 
how you repay me?" 
He probed a bit deeper.
"And what if I wanted something more?"
The professor grew a grin, "I could gave you anything you want! I could
build you a new ship.. I know you want that!"

He smiled, "Sorry, no deal, a GR members life is worth less than a 
citizens in danger... and I don't see you using my ship's design for airshows!"

Robotnik faced away, "No matter," he punched a button on the comms
system, "Packbell, I need you to persuade someone up here.."

The monitor continued to dictate death, "DTA LOST", Kate looked at Craig.
"Damnit, we have to go after them, I just know something terrible has 
happened to them.. "  Craig rotated his head to look at her, "Kate, 
I understand your anxiety, and that you believe you have the ability to sense
happenings across the vacuum of space.. But you should relax, they have
flown many missions, many of them to Earth before.. " Kate stopped him,
"What if they're not on Earth, after all Paxis didn't hear anything about a 
crashing ship or a great space battle... Craig, what if they are lying on 
some alien ship somewhere, being played with by some evil Cinz soldier?"
He could sense her emotion, but, he was the base commander, and 
a matter in truespace was no matter of his.. in fact.. losing a ship to
true space could prove a rather embarassing situation.

"Kate, we don't want to go jumping into affairs that are not our own,
but, if by the end of the week we haven't heard anything, I personally
will launch.. Okay?" He was good with people, she embraced him--
standard practice for a female human of her culture. 

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 21:00 Mobius Forest 
****************************************************************************** 

Sonic and Sally sat side by side watching the slumbering fox that the scout  
party had brought back. Sleeping beauty, trapped in the realm of dreams.
Bookshire after various examination concluded he had been drugged, though 
there was little proof to support this, but he could offer no other 
explanation. His temprature normal, heartbeat regular and breathing good, 
if by some weapon he had become stunned, it had left no trace -- there
wasn't a sign of any trauma to his body, his furr unsinged, his skin 
unpunctured. Leaving only the possibility of poisoned food. 

And what a poison it must have been, nothing they had tried to rouse him 
had worked, not the three kilometers he was dragged back to Knothole base,
nor the prodding, shaking or yelling. 

Now they had resorted to the last method known, wrapping him in blankets and 
leaving him to come out of his slumber to them. This was something neither 
Sonic nor Sally enjoyed. For Sonic it was the worst, minutes to him felt 
like an eternity, and nothing he could do would make it pass, his mind had
long since passed wondering -- considering every thought he ever had. The war,
the king, his friends, Robotnik.. and this very odd person.

How would this smoothish-furred fox look when their was life in his eyes and
motion in his limbs? What type of person was he, what did he do? And what  
would he do when awake? 

Abruptly he stood up and paced over to the window, looking up at the stars,
the little scene change altered his "prison-sentence" for a while, making it
slightly shorter. He turned his head to look at his prosecutioner, the
sleepy aura pulled him in, sooner or later, probably sooner he too would 
pass out. 

Princess Sally stared endlessly at the fox, it reminded her of someone, 
someone she had once known, many, many years ago. Though if it was him, had 
he not been killed or roboticised, age would have surely taken it's toll. 
And from his skin she could see age was an unpayed debt, as unpayed as 
Robotnik's deeds to the land, deeds that one day in maroon light and 
crimson reflection would be repayed.. with the same coldness he had issued 
them. 

But now was not a time to think, for whoever the fox was it would soon be 
answered, he groaned into life. Sally stood up-- too quickly, and had to wait
a moment as her blood flow equalised, in the meantime however Sonic had not
wasted any time at coming to his side. 

The fox groaned.
Lifting an arm to his face he surveyed it, as if to make sure it was still 
there, as though he expected something different. He grasped his hand in the
air then dropped it to his chest, sighed, took a deep breath, layed back and 
looked up. 

Sonic edged closer, alarming him, he jerked for a moment, closed his eyes
for two seconds, opened them again and slowly began to speak, his voice 
golden and ambient like a warrior or a prince. "My name is Jonathan Righter,
if I may enquire where am I?"

Sonic started, "I'm Sonic, Sonic the hedgehog.." forcing in an answer, "and  
I don't think I could tell you where you are.. " carefully hiding any data. 
Sally paced over to him, "hello, Jonathan, don't worry, you're safe now." 

He flung his head over, causing them both to jump back in caution, 
then, slower this time turned his head up to face her. Mumbling softly and 
apologetically "uh sorry, umm, muscle spasm ..." The two freedom fighters
edged closer, Sally braving to talk to him again. "What happened to you?" 
This time his voice a lot more wavering and uncollected he began his story.
"Well, you see, I was walking along, and then.. uuuhm, well uuh.. actually 
I can't really remember much after that.... uuhm.. not much before it either,
just lots of trees and some factory... and someone.. uuh I hope she's Okay.."
Sonic rolled his eyes, this was the most generalised story he'd ever heard, 
and every moment it went on he trusted this... this outsider less. Sally 
however was paying a lot of detail to the points of it. "Where did she 
live?" 

He paused for a moment, then continued to toil with the thread, "uuh, um, 
well, all I really remember was this big room with her sitting across from me, 
on that greenish chair.. Now, what was that place called, geeesh, I'm sure 
it was the capitol.." Sally's eyes lit up, "Mobitropolis?" Again he stumbled
around thoughts, "uuhm, not sure, uuh, but I would know her place if I saw 
it.." 

Sally extended an arm and patted him on the head, changing her voice to hide 
as much emotion as possible, slowing it, and rubbing his head, "Jonathan, 
if she lived in Mobotropolis... then .. there is a chance that.. the battle
has caused.. the battle.. that she has lost to the battle.." He closed his
eyes, letting out low moans, "No, what has happened.. why? What has become
of .. of.. everything?" 

She hugged him softly, Sonic didn't like this at all, but he let her continue
on about hope and losing people. It ended minutes later with them leaving him  
to sleep and silently closing the door, stepping out into the chilly fresh 
forest air.

As they walked away from the hut Sonic began warning the princess about how
he didn't trust him, and how they should keep an eye out, and Robotnik's 
agents. Inside the hut however Jonathan the Fox reopened his eyes.

They were gone, for now the interrogation had ended, soon they would stop for
good, either accepting or rejecting him -- he had seen it plenty of times 
before. He voted for the former, and with the 'Device' helping him it would
be easy enough to convince them of his good intentions.

A new line overlayed on his vision: "New PDB entry created."  He smiled as 
the "device" did some more calculations, already he
was beginning to know these people, as he gradually built up his 
"Personality Dictator Base" he would be able to predict them, even act like 
them. A sparkle of static overlayed his vision as the videoclip player 
reconfigured itself to the new architechture of his brain, it's luminous 
colours mutating until finally they made up an image. 

It was from the day, the lady... Sonic's friend who had been 
trying to soothe his "most unfortunate loss" was being compared to the 
personality she dictated earlier. Back then, as they hung in the net, she
transmitted negative body language, asserting a level of leadership in the
group. Obviously she was an absolute against this war she'd talked about,
yet she still mantained a softer side.. 

Another PDB was created for Sonic, in a few moments he gathered up 
information on him. A leader, from what he had seen so far, also feeling
strongly about the war, also some type of hero or a holder of a high 
morale/ego -- the way he said his name revealed it. From what he could tell,
the hedgehog doubted him, and/or liked whoever she was.. which reminded him 
to ask her name next time he saw her.

The 'device' added it immediatly to it's list of priorities, wonderfull
little thing he thought. From the day he'd had it installed, after the
'accident' it had served him well, and it could continue to do so for another
two years on the single orb that still retained it's charge. Within that time
he would have to recharge it, not a critical issue, but something he could
begin working on.. tomorrow. 

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 22:00 Robotropolis 
****************************************************************************** 

Huge arcs of energy surged over his skin, enough energy to kill any 
other lifeform instantly with pain, but the "device" protected him from this
by simply filtering any erratic signal going down his neural lines out. 
Marken looked across to Robotnik and Packbell, in his normal relaxed
sarcastic voice he began to torture them. "Geesh, this is terrible, I''ve 
never been so bored in my life.. PLEEAAASE Stop..." Chuckling in 
humour he began to make horrid cracks about androids and drinking
glasses of water.

Commander Packbell was less than amused, this human was beginning 
to really annoy him. To make matters worse nothing they could do would
hurt him, and it seemed that everything they tried only allowed him to 
torture them more. 
On an even worse note Robotnik was beginning to become destructive,
and with him not being able to hurt the prisoner he would sooner or later
begin on him -- a definate problem.

He cranked the power up more, he could almost see the lights dim, 
this human was either mad or simply had no nervous lines. Mark 
smiled up at him and in an impersonation of Robotniks voice started
again. "Carefull Packwell my boy, you'll shock yourself.." He cranked
the power up again.

The voltage reached such a high level that it found it easier to arc 
across to the android than pass through Mark. It struck him on the
arm reeking havoc and chaos across his systems -- he strained 
for a a moment as servos went wild. Then with an heir of finality 
shut off the machine. Once again bringing the human back online.
"Geesh, are you stupid or something, I warned you, but hell no! 
I'm a android, I'm so clever yeah... and you know, I'm not scared 
off anything.. Because I'm so damn clever.."

Robotnik exploded, "roboticize him!  I've had enough of it, just 
robotocise him.. NOW!"

Packbell undid the straps, and pulled him up, once again he 
cracked another line, "Wow, have you heard of decaf out here? 
Geesh, You don't have cell-phones, you don't have decaf, what kind
of stupid planet is this anyway?"

Packbell didn't listen, he simply stuffed his hand into the humans 
offensive mouth and carried him down the hallway to the set of 
cylindrical tubes that layed dormant, just waiting for something to 
do.

They stuffed him into one of these tubes, lowered the glass, and
glared at him. The computer began it's boot sequence, powering
up the giant capacitors that would be his fate. Inside the machine
he gunned out comments like usual. Joking about Microsloth and 
Windoze and the computers they were using. 

Suddenly a giant beam came bearing down on him, but it never 
struck him, terminated by an energy shield not milimeters from 
his skin, the "device" showed it's ability once more. Abruptly the 
beam stopped and the computer echoed a message.

LIFEFORM NOT DETECTED, ABORT, RETRY, FAIL ?>

Mark Yelled at them, "What are you trying to do, just remember
pops, if I go, you'll never get the designs you want.. and if you
tamper with it too much there's a thermo.." 

Robotnik rudely interrupted, folding his hands together in front of
him and pacing forward while grinning evily. "On the contrary my 
dear boy, I will have all secrets after you are my slave!"
He pointed towards where the beam would have hit Mark, "and,
while you may do your little tricks, they won't protect you forever..
Sooner or later, your power will run low, and then, then.. you will be 
MINE!"

Mark reeled back, the "device" abruptly moved all data concerning
reading the data recorder from his mind to it's own 7GB data storage
where it would remain encrypted. In turn he began, "You'll never 
succeed, if your toy even touches me, some thrirty grams of plastic
explosive in my mind will detonate, turning your stupid little fantasy
of me as a slave into potato salad like Jonathan's mom used to make!"

Though he knew this was not the truth -- there was no explosive, it
was still partly true, the "device" had all the information concerning
the SeaGrate drive now, and if he for some reason should come to the
end of organic functioning, the "device" would fail to operate with 
the new systems. To top it, the encryption method it used for 
storing data was "shift bits and play tetris" also, the data was
stored in 14bit bytes, and representations of human storage. Thus,
even if they did decrypt it, only a human mind could read it, only
a human mind like his had similar references to pockets of 
data. Any other human would get garbage.. it was significant only
to his mind mapping.

Robotnik turned away, "carry on Packbell.." Once more the beam
flashed down on him, this time however the "device" was far better
prepared. Having analysed the beam earlier it knew it's type -- 
electromagnetic. Two energy poles formed over his head, deflecting
the beam, which refracted through the glass and passed just 
by Robotnik's head.

Again Marken burst into comment, this time however far more worried.
After all, he should have been, he could deflect the beam only so much
longer before all the orbs lost their power. Right now he had only three
of them left, the third one only semi-charged, it's true energy level 
unknown because of his incapability to test Silicon capacitors which 
kept their power constant until they ran completely out of energy.

"Ok, I feel worried now, I'm willing to tell you how to use the drive,
but.. only if you can sponsor me a ship to take me off this dumb
planet.." He knew they wouldn't keep their promise, but hey, he
wasn't about to keep his either.

Robotnik waved his hand in a motion telling Packbell to cut off the
robotocizer... The android then regained his grip on the human and
carried him back to the main control centre. They sat him down
in front of a computer. "There.." commanded Robotnik, "now, you
will give me the information." Marken smiled, "certainly.. but.." he
pointed to where a keyboard would normally be, "I would prefer an
asci keyboard... please.." 

Suddenly he began shaking his head in small convulsions that soon
became dominant all over his body as he fell backwards off the chair
and smashed his skull against the floor. Packbell looked down at
the crumpled-up pathetic malfunctioning human. "Apparently the
'persuaders' have had a most unforseen side-effect"

Robotnik rolled his eyes as the convolsions ended and cross-faded
into sleep. "Put him in my sick bay, and have two swat-bots guard 
the door. We'll see what we can extract in the morning...." 
Packbell siezed the body and headed towards the door when he
was interrupted again, "Oh, and Packbell my boy, see about getting
a keyboard.. " He nodded and passed out the door carrying the 
limp body.

Marken opened his eyes, he was quite amazed that his little program 
had actually worked, he wasn't one of those .. "coder guys" but, hey, he
could also "grive" at that weird "funk." He stood up and took a look
around, from what he could tell, he was in private quarters. This was
definately not a cell, sure, it had barred windows, but how often do
cells have air conditioning? 

Nice, a vent in the roof, possibly a good exitway, though it posed
a problem as it was rather small. He would find it rather hard to 
squeeze through there while he was human... 

"Well Jonathan, looks like RL10 is about to lose another human, 
but, hey.. who better to become a furry than me.." he humoured
himself as he selected "morph." Then he layed down on the floor,
it had a nice blue carpet, too bad he would mess it up, well, maybe
human blood would wash out of it..

A few moments later he wasn't all that concerned about it any more
as he writhed in crackling agony.

****************************************************************************** 
                          Time 04:00 Robotropolis 
****************************************************************************** 
Mark looked over the mess on the floor and up the walls, nope, 
cleaning this mess off would require a laser weapon. Too bad they hadn't
heard of that fangled "new non-stick paint", but seeing that he wasn't going
to be cleaning it, he looked up at the ceiling. Yups, this would be a real 
breeze, climb up into ventilation duct, destroy SeaGrate drive, exit via 
duct, steal ship and get off the planet. He wondered for a moment if his 
plan would allow him time to eat, as his stomach's contents had been 
ejected around there somewere, huh, too bad to let all that nutrition go 
to waste.

He stepped forward but was stopped by a squishing noise, he looked down,
amazingly the "device" had even scavenged enough material to give him 
some "smooth-smooth cool-cool" shoes.. or sneakers as the Americans
called them, below them was some internal organ, he picked it up and 
looked at it for a moment wondering exactly what it was, maybe his liver,
or spleen.. hmm. how extremely fascinating. Another pity he didn't have a
jar to put it in, otherwise he would, the thought of bringing out a morbid 
bottle filled with inards every time someone ate curry REALLY appealed 
to him. 

He scaled the wall, and hanging upside down on the nicely textured 
ceiling, clambered towards the grating, after a bit of messing with it 
he finally opened it and clambered inside. Slamming it back down, a
surge of pain went through him, of all things he had managed to close
his tail in the grate. Cursing, he rectified the problem, then took a moment 
to observe this odd piece of cartlidge. "Great" he mumbled to himself
"what in the hell am I? Some kind of Racoon? Geesh, as if it isn't 
enough trouble having a tie fall in your coffie.."

Now he would be able to enjoy a whole series a interesting activities,
including shutting his tail in car doors, getting his tail caught in elevator
doors, getting shocked to hell when his tail picked up static electricity
from persian carpets. Getting his tail stood on by someone wearing high
heels! And finally his personal favourite, having his tail fall in his coffie.
"Way to go Mark-han.. " he concluded as he scrambled off down the
air-way.

Eventually he arrived in a vent looking down into the control room, 
from what he could see Robotnik wasn't there. So, cautiously he 
removed the grating, lifted it above his head, dropped down, and 
let if fall back into place. 

On the floor he quickly scampered underneath a control panel, inside
it had a metal overhang on which he sat. No sooner than he had become 
comfortable, the doors hissed open and Robotnik resumed his place in a 
chair not two meters away. 

>From Mark the Racoons point of view, this guy never slept, unlike
him, even at that moment the power drain of morphing had begun
to affect him. Repeatly in his mind he odered himself. "I will not fall
asleep, I will not fall asleep.. I ... will not.. fall asleep.." then as 
his new body asserted itself " I will .. not snore.. while .. I sleep."
In a few moments he was a warm bundle of slumber.

****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan was awaken by Sonic and his friend, who, he quickly found
out was called "Princess Sally", they invited him to breakfeast, and
he openly agreed.. after all he hadn't eaten for an entire day. 

At the table he was once more asked about his origin, this time 
however he was far more prepared and confident, he claimed that 
he knew little of where he came from, and that all he could remember
were brief moments of his life... which he preferred not to think of.

In turn he was told the story of Robotnik, the kingdom, the roboticizer, 
armada's of robots and evil plans. The whole time the "device" monitoring
everyone, adding new personalities to his database. Because of this 
ability he was able to detect the negativity coming from the hedgehog.
It seemed no matter what he did or said would change his mind, this
brought to the top of his mind that sooner or later their would be a 
conflict in the group -- Something he would prefer to avoid if possible.

****************************************************************************** 
                              Time 08:00 Robotropolis
****************************************************************************** 
Marken was awakened by violent yelling, apparently Robotnik was having a
little tiffy. "What do you mean.. he just exploded?"  There was a type of
wimpering as one of his subservients tried to explain. "Sir, take a .. look
for yourself.." 

There was a metallic clang as something or somebody was thrown up against
a wall, then a hiss as the door opened and someone walked out, and a type
of subsiding wining softening slowly as it was dragged further away. 

Mark popped out of hiding, "alone at last" he looked around, yupsyipee, they're 
gone. Now, to do something about recharging. There was a type of metering device
on wheels in the corner of the room. He dived at it.

Setting it onto resistance he was amazed that both Earth and Mobius used
Ohms. Then, plugging one probe into a hundred volt DC power supply,
the other on his chest, and the power supply ground on his back, he began to
maneuver them around. The resistance twitched, 6.3MOhms, he moved it a 
bit more, then suddenly, 0.2 MOhms.
"Bing, one hundred volts point five amps, don't let me down now orbies.." he
chuckled to himself. 

A few minutes later the resistance had risen back to normal, he moved the 
electrodes a bit, again the resistance dropped as another power hungry 
orb attained it's charge.. at this rate he would be fully charged in an hour.

Suddenly with a hiss the control room doors opened, in waltzed a very 
peeved Robotnik, who fortunately didn't notice him. The racoon looked frantically
for a hiding place, but there was none. Sooner or later he was going to be noticed,
and he didn't want to stick around to see the consequences. 

Suddenly an image of the android appeared on a large VDU, he spoke with
satisfaction in his voice. "Sir, the new Swat-bots will be quite effective at 
purging them from the planet. I have sent a sweep of them to the Great-Forest."
The hairless rulers voice changed, "excellent.. carry on commander.. carry on.."
With that the image collapsed in on itself. 

The last orb reached it's charge, causing the power supply to emmit an 
exposing beep, with it Robotnik rotated his chair. "Well, well, what have we
here, a little freedom fighter.."

His blood froze, but the "device" didn't, it issued a set of escape sequences 
to his suggestive mind. With it he grabbed a scanner off the table he was on,  
and threw it at the exposed circuits of a computer all the way on the other side 
of the room. The two collided with a spark, instantly the lights went out.
 He ran for the door, pushing the 'open' switch, then scuttled back past 
Robotnik in the dark. 

Robotnik dived out into the passage, screaming orders to his droids, 
"Find him, he can't have got far! Search every room on this floor and triple the
patrols outside." Then a lot calmer.. "I have you now.."

Marken resumed his position below the control panel while the search went on,
the droids searching out every possible room, every possible hook, crack, pipe 
and shaft.. except for one place -- this room. 

Suddenly the doors hissed open, something or somebody entered, and then a
voice he knew as "Packbell" resonated, "we've found him sir."   There was a 
thud as some whimpering creature was dropped to the ground. The result, 
Robotnik detonated.. again.. "this is not him!  Find him, and bring him back here!"

The android responded by picking up the creature and heading for the door, 
Robotnik stopped him.. again. "You can leave him here.." The droid aknowledged
and dropped the prisoner on the ground.. again. 

For a few moments there was a silence as the door hissed shut and Packbell
moved off.. and for a few seconds afterwards the silence remained. Then finally
Robotnik broke it with a calm, collected voice. "I find it difficult to deal with people
when I don't know their name.."  The creature paused, fear in the air. "b..b..b.Barney"
Again there was a chilling silence before the toiler continued. "Tell me Barney, if you
had a switch with three settings on, 1-2-3 respectively. Which one would you select?"
Barney knew what the switch manifested as, for it resided on the rifle that Robotnik 
was now fingering, so as a safety measure he took the neutral path. "Well, it 
d...d..depends on wh..wh.. what you.. wh...whh..want to do w.w..ww.ith.. it.."

Suddenly the chair rotated, there was a scrambling noise of shoes on metal, an
ear-piercing blast followed by a cut-off scream, and finally after the impact of
flesh against metal, a noise that sounded like a fire being extinguished by
water. The grim smell of burning flesh floated over to Mark, he wanted to be 
sick, but the andrenalin rushing through him wouldn't permit it.. "I'd select three
and blow the living crap out of you, you bloated toad!" he yelled to himself.

Robotnik's chair swung back around, "Dispatch, remove a body from here.."

******************************************************************************

****************************************************************************** 
Princess Sally pointed at Robotropolis from the rocky outcrop the three
were now standing on. "There.." Jonathan stopped, in the distance the sickened
image bubbled. It reminded him of a return flight to GRBase-I, a return that had 
shown him the true power of evil. Evil of such magnitude that's even Earths 
agents of eco-destruction would be awed. 

Unclogging his throat and pulling a rich voice he looked at the two freedom 
fighters. "So, there it is, the poisoning blister that juts out our own life-force and
festers on it's own evil.." He liked to speak in a poetic manner, and was usually
quite good at it. Sonic rolled his eyes, he still didn't trust this guy, and knew 
sooner or later they were going to see his real mettle.

The fox sat down on the edge of a large rock overlooking the valley below, 
staring at the city in amazement--it never slept, continually boiled and bubbled
like a witches brew, stirring up chaos for the primary inhabitants of this world.
In the smoke little dots were darting around, supply ships, war ships, whatever,
and every single one of them was a potential threat. 

Sally sat down next to him, she'd accepted long ago the destruction on her world,
and what her mission was, to bring it to an end.. oneday. But from this fox 
emmanated feelings of sadness and loss of such energy that they pulled her back
into the thoughts she had the first time she saw Robotropolis's cloud of evil. 

Sonic sat down too, partly because he could mutually feel the pain, and also, 
because Sal had. He was the first to break the silence, "Jon bud, don't you 
remember this?" The fox faced him, "I know why I would want to forget it.."
Sonic looked down to the forest below, there was nothing more he could say.

For a few more moments there was silence, even Sonic sat perfectly still, 
the fox broke it with a frightened yell. "What in the hell is that?"  Pointing at
a fast moving blob getting rapidly larger and heading to more or less from where 
they had come. The two freedom fighter stood up, holding their hands over their
eyes to get a better look without the glare from the sun. Sonic spluttered. 
"SwatBOTS!"

He sped on ahead as fast as possible to warn the others, while Jonathan 
and Sally ran side by side back to base. It was going to take a miracle to prevent 
them from being crackled and crispied by the end of the day. In the distance they
could already hear bursts of weapon fire. 
 
Running to the max they came to the centre of the chaos, rebels were diving in 
every direction trying to avoid beams of energy. In the panic a small fox had 
stumbled and was now lying crouched down hands-over head futily hoping it
would save him from a blast. Above him one of the droids wasted no time in 
taking aim, in a moment of andrenalin and digital panic, it was all over.

Jonathan's body lay crumpled up on the ground, having used all his speed to
save the fox.. and succeeded, but a price had to be payed.  A few seconds 
later the droid tore as Sonic ravaged through it--In turn, a few minutes later the 
action was all over, the remaining droids either returning to base or lying 
non-functional in scrap heaps all over the forest.

When the blue-disk-of-droid-death finally slowed down he went off in search for
Sally. He found her cuddling a frightened but otherwise okay Tails. "Hey, Sal,
where's Jon?" he enquired, relieved that she was okay.

Princess Sally faced him, a tear running down her soft face, pointing at the
smoking heap with the burning grass around it, she forced out between even 
more tears. "Th.. there.. he saved Tails life, ... pushed him out the way.. and ..
and.. took.. took.."  

Sonic faced away, "No.. No.. NO!" he slammed his fist against a tree "NO!!!"
His mind rapidly boiling with guilt, regret and anger,  if only he'd been faster, 
if only at least he'd got to know him, he was wrong, Jonathan Righter WAS 
a hero. And then finally, Jonathan Righter went out like a hero.. He stopped,
walked over to Sally and Tails, and embraced them both. 

He was about to begin speaking when something stopped him. The body 
moved, the body groaned, the body stood up, and screamed in a voice 
that echoed across the mountains. "NO!  WHY? MURDERERS!  YOU 
WILL PAY FOR THIS!  EVERY LAST INCH OF ME THAT BORE 
TESTIMONY TO WHAT I ONCE WAS WILL BURN YOU!"

Sonic ran over to Jonathan, "Jon? What's up?" But Jonathan just pushed him
to the side and dissapeared off into the bush. Sonic stood up, looked at a very
confused Sally and Tails, and let his mouth drop in awe. Sally looked back at
him even more amazed, beams that size killed people if not cut them straight
in half, and apart from surviving, what was he talking about?

"Revenge?" asked Rotor curiously "but why?" Sally glanced at all of them,
"well, he talked about someone he once knew, maybe when that defective beam
hit him he remembered something.." Bookshire butt in, "good concept your highness,
only one thing point, that beam couldn't have been defective.. When weapons 
fire, they fire with constant power, a few seconds after it shot him, it tore a tree
by me straight in half.."  Sonic spun his head in amazement, "Are you saying that
he's a Robot?"  A bubble of mutter came from the group, Bunnie added to the end
of it, "well, what if it just missed him, I mean it wouldn't kill him, but it sure would
shake him.."   Again a mutter from the group. Sonic finished this time, "well, 
whatever he is, or whatever happened, he's gone of looking for Robotnik, and if
we don't stop him.. " he slammed his hand on the table of the war room to show
what would become of their mysterious new friend.
Sally, added, "That's why we need volunteers.."

Marken crawled back through the air system again, geesh, he smiled to himself,
putting on a ladies voice, "huh, I though he'd never leave.." He pulled forward,
his movements dampened by at least two-centimeters of dust. He looked down
at it, good thing sinusitus can't follow you through morphs, but still, the least 
the search droids could have done, when they searched the system about an 
hour ago, was to clean up a bit. 

Whatever, right now he had to find a way out of here, he'd never believed those
statistics that nuclear plants have twenty-miles of copper wire in then or 
something like that, but whatever this building was, it had enough ventilation 
shaft in it to make.. to make... hmm.. well something with a lot of pipes. 
He imagined sooner or later he would bump into the "Marie Brothers" and "King
Glooper".. 

In the distance he could barely make out a fan, a fan sucking in outside
(and not altogether pleasant) air.

The fox crashed through the woods, in his opinion Jonathan Righter 
died when he was hit by that beam, died when the "device" sucked 
every last bit of power to shield him, died when without the "device"
the last part of his brain it was keeping human lost the battle to the cells
of his new body. Now he was a fox.. his emotions had become that of a
fox, the one bit of his mind that humanly manifested as his conscience--
giving him human feelings was gone. Robbed by Robotnik, stolen by 
evil, leaving him like this.. a tear rolled down his face.. only serving to make
him more angry.. this was not him..

He cursed the instinct of direction he now had that took him back towards
where this had all began, where he'd transformed, and .. where his pistol 
lay..

"Damnit Craig, I can't wait any longer, I'm telling you, he's in pain!" 
around Kate in the operations room, people of every race, type, species
and sex monotonously continued their work of monitoring the Star-base's 
functions. Craig spoke again, "Kate, I feel guilty, but I refuse to authorize
you to take a ship out into the unknown." This time calmer, "Kate, we do
look after our own, and, my ruling stands firm, if they don't reply in a week,
we will scout for them."

Tears of frustation began to roll down Kate's face, "Craig.. The pain I can
feel is so intense, so intense, when ever I sense him, I feel pain, pain
all around him, in him, through him. Craig.. He is pain, anger and frustration
burning like I've never felt before.. Not even on my own homeworld.. "
Her voice began trembling,"MY OWN HOMEWORLD, CRAIG.."

He looked at her again, "Kate, you only serve to make me feel guilty,
you are hurting me, you are hurting yourself.. But we can't live by
emotion, we have to live by logic.."

Kate's eye sparkled, her voice changed, it became calmer, then 
wiping away the tears she continued. "Craig, can I speak with you..
alone.."
"Certainly.."

She led him out to the hangar, and pointed to the Draconis-II, a prototype
jump ship -- designed primarily for true-space flight. Among other things
it was armed with warheads that could 'jump' using gravity to fields 
to almost any location in space. 

"Craig, if on friday we haven't heard from them, we would be using this
ship.. right?" Craig smiled at her, "Yes, if for some reason they don't
respond.. which would be unlikely.. wouldn't it really?"

Kate cut her words into him, "You're afraid, stop hiding it and do something
about it.. You're human for God's sake, even though you doubled your
metabolic rate, you are still a human, a human with feelings. Stop 
behaving like an android."

He stared at her, "feelings cost lives, and I have chosen to run by 
logic."

But once more she was prepared, "Craig, you are afraid! It only takes
an hour to configure the ship, but you configured it yesterday, 
slightly illogical don't you think?" 

He froze, she was right, and he admitted it, "yes, I felt anxious, but
I control my feelings.. A practice you should learn."
"Well", she beamed happily, "your feelings have cost you dearly.."

Before he was fully able to grasp the situation, it had befallen him, 
he'd been shot. Her hand blaster crumpling him up in a stunned
heap on the floor. She stood over him for a while, then, dropped 
something down to him, a shiny silver badge. "Sorry Craig, I guess
I always have been a rebel, you see, I value people more than law.
On my homeworld, against the Cinz, now and forever.."

With that, she walked over to the ship, got in, and took off.

Jonathan the fox picked up the pistol, checked it's energy.. there it was
ready.. ready to rampage, destroy and murder in an atire that would make
Satan himself shirk. He looked at the gun, it felt odd in his new hands, it 
all felt odd, everything about the situation was odd. He didn't quite feel like
killing anymore, if he did start killing.. logic told him, he would be blasting 
people's robotocized families away. Eventually, his power would run too 
low to permit him to fight anymore.. he would either be killed or 
Robotocized, and if the latter came about, he would end up an unthinking
slave, granting his power of information to the side of evil.

No, he could, would never do that, he would stop it all now.. He pointed the
gun to his head, a brain may die a hero, a body is but flesh. 

He never pulled the trigger though, he just sat there, wondering, 
wondering what Marken's fate had been, pehaps now, he 
wasn't a carbon lifeform.. maybe silicon and plastic, bursting with
evil. 

The "device" would normally have warned him about now.
He was becoming far too depressed.. and every moment he sank deeper 
in the swamp of despair, the pressure increased, until sooner or later he 
would implode. But, no digital overlay had anything to say about it, 
it's power used up on protecting him.. He dropped the gun to face the floor 
as tears ran down his face, his emotions pouring out slowly.

Softly a voice called out, "Jonathan? Is that you?" Out of the bush 
climbed a teenage racoon who glanced over the fox, "Geesh bro, 
what in the hell happened to you?"   But Jonathan didn't answer, he simply
grabbed Mark and embraced him, making his comrade feel even more 
confused.

Grabbing him around the chest and forcing him away, yet still holding him 
within an arms length, Marken began trying to figure out what had 
happened to his friend. "Okay, Jonathan, now I don't have time for the full 
story, so just give me the latest.." 

The fox began, his voice wavering,
"They.. shot .. me.. the.. device.. lost.. it's .. power.. and now... my mind.. 
is.. no.. longer human.." Mark, looked into his eyes, amazed.. "So?"
The fox spluttered out, "So, don't you see? My human mind has died, my
consience is dead.. And.. I feel ..like this.."  Mark, stood for a moment 
digesting the data, then spoke softly, "You don't die with the same cells
you are born with. Your whole life, weak cells die, but the strong suckers
carry on. Our life doesn't work on single cells, but all of them working as a
team.. Can't you see what's happened here? Your cells were just replaced
with those little chemical blops that outnumbered them. Sure.. you might 
feel odd, hell, you might be totally psycho, but no matter what.. you are 
still you.. a bit crazier.. but the same guy who flew against the Cinz forces
three years ago.. and the same guy who's my friend."

Jonathan embraced him.. again. He let out a sigh of relief, "thanks Mark..", 
and kissed him on the cheek. Marken didn't like this, but "whatever", he thought
to himself,  those dudes in the bible used to do that a lot, and as long as his
friend just kept it to that, it would be okay with him. 

A few minutes later whatever tears had fallen had vanished into the ground,
and while Jonathan's new emotions were a bit odd, they were generally 
back to their normal selves.. As such, Marken grabbed his comrades tail,
and began cracking all the jokes about persian carpets, high-heels, 
car-doors, elevators and coffie. 

Suddenly, out of his laughter Jonathan stopped, putting his hands on Marks
shoulders and looking straight at him. Mark hoped he wasn't going to hug him 
again. He didn't, he spoke instead, worriedly: "Shit, we've gotta get back to
base, they'll have a search party out looking for me by now.."
"What? And where are we going to get the ship?" he replied in a low tone.
"No, I mean the guys who chased us.."
"Those morons, what the hell did they want?"
"Actually, they're quite nice, and thought we worked for the guy that 
they swapped you for one of their friends with.."
Marken smiled, "Jon, you are and always will be, no matter how morphed,
terrible at that communication stuff."
"Shut up, I'll explain to you on the way!"

The fox and racoon ran off into the forest, leaving the pistol in the bushes,
heading for Knothole.

From this postion in truespace she could detect nothing, the scanners
on her ship were the best available, but even they couldn't pick up any
intelligent signal out of the electromagnetic chaos of space. 

She locked scanners onto 'Gravity Magnitude Modulation" mode, they
searched for a moment, only however coming up with current GR
transmissions. [Note: GMM is the standard the GR use for transmission,
as gravity fields travel instantly, allowing realtime communication. For
example: it would take 271 Years for GRB-II  transmissions to reach
GRCentral via normal radio, while GMM is naturally instant.]

"Computer, search for all possible life planets within 24 hours at 
speed 150C.." 

The computer seemingly did nothing for a moment, she smiled, 
Marken used to joke that they did it to seem impressive. 
"157 Possible planets found.."
"Oh, shit!"
"Computer, scan current planets for engine traces, or non-standard
entropy."
Once again the ship's computer went to work for a moment,
"Three planets found.."
"Plot otimal course using all three planets.."
"Done."
"Go nav1 to nav3, speed 110C."

From amongst the bushes, Bunnie and Rotor spied the fox and
raccoon, they called up Sally on their communicator, and then 
quickly rushed towards them.

Jonathan was speaking, "..and then it's own army turned in on itself... led by...",  
when suddenly, out of the bush ahead of them Bunnie appeared. For a quick 
instant the two got a fright before the fox finally spoke, "hiya.. what's up?"
Bunnie smiled, "you are hon' if you keep on going down this path.." He 
stared at her shocked, "..and, why would that be?" 
"'Cause" she smiled, "that ain't the way to Knothole.."

Jonathan sighed, "you had me worried for a moment there. If just for a 
short one... Just one thing, who are you?" She beamed, "why, they 
call me Bunnie around here.. Bunnie Rabbot." 
"Aah, well, my name is Jona.."
"..than Righter, I know hon', I know.."
Rotor pointed to the raccoon, "who'd you bring back?"

Before he could answer however, Mark began, looking at Bunnie 
and ripping off her voice he began, "well 'hun they call me Mark,
uum, Marken Psantis that is mind you.." They all smiled, even 
Bunnie, all except for Rotor, "Marken Psantis, I'm sure I heard 
your name some place before.."
Jonathan quickly changed the subject, "well, I guess we'd better 
see the princess?" 
They headed off the path and into the bush, back towards Knothole.
Eventually, after a rather long journey, they arrived at Sally's hut.

Outside they met with Sonic and Sally, who asked a whole 
series of questions, all of which Jonathan either lied about, 
or "toiled the thread" with.   

Then came the introductions, Marken met a whole series of
people, some of them hugged him. He didn't like that.. but
he took it in his stride, "after all" he thought to himself, "you
could be stuck on this planet for the rest of your life Marken Psantis,
natural life that is though.." 

Aftterwards, they stood around in groups talking to one another,
Mark was involved in a very heavy conversation about "anti-static
spray" for his tail, with Rotor when Jonathan broke in. "Excuse me,
Mark, have you met Princess Sally?"
"Princess?"
"Yes."
He reeled around to face her, performed a beautiful bow, 
dropped to his knees, took her hand softly, kissed it, and then 
after a short moment, spoke. "Your highness, I am Marken Psantis."
Sally was amazed, Sonic and Jonathan both rolled their eyes.  

Later on as the sun began to set, Mark found Jonathan sitting alone 
on a log, he walked over and sat down next to him. 
"What's up bro?"
The fox took a deep breath, "depressed, just depressed.."
"Aaaahh... you not still going on about that fox-brain thing are you?"
Jonathan squeezed a blank smile, "thanks for reminding me.."
"Oh come on, geesh, I mean, apart from the fact that we are 
trapped billions of miles away from any other GR planet, stuck
in bodies we weren't born with.. and having to put up with a mad
scientist.. Doesn't mean things are all that bad, it means that 
things are terrible.." the raccoon chuckled, "terrible.."
But Jonathan couldn't let himself be humoured, "we're stuck here..
we're really stuck here.. There's no way out, and we can't trust 
anyone."
"What about these guys.. don't they qualify?"
"That's what I mean, I'm lying to them all.. Spinning lies that
are going to get me back.."

Mark smiled, "Want to see instant solution?"
"You have one?"
"Marken Psantis, always has a solution.. "

With that the raccoon jumped up and headed towards the hedgehog,
Jonathan trailing behind him, hoping he wasn't going to do something
stupid.. "Princess, Sonic, my friend an I want to have a chat with you.."

Jonathan's eyes exploded with fear as the four headed off into Sally's hut.
Siiting across from each other on beds, Sonic and Sally on the one, 
Jonathan and Mark on the other, Mark wasted no time in starting.
 "Jonathan here, is going to tell you a story about a universe far-far away..
aren't you?" 

The fox smiled awkwardly. 
"Well" he said, energising his voice, "there is a group of fighters in a 
universe far-far from here, they are called the GR, or 'Guardians of Reality',
their task is to uphold law an order." 
"And?" asked Sonic.
"And, Jonathan is about to continue" smiled the raccoon.

"And, well, they have these ships, star-ships that can jump from one 
universe to the other with their advanced technology. But they had an 
enemy called the Cinz, who believed that.."
Marken butt in, "who tried to attack a little planet.."
The fox went a sickly colour, "..uuh.. but they failed, as the GR stopped
them just before they could fire their weapons.."
"But.. then.. the GR ship.."
"Then the GR ship gained intolerable damage by being hit by some of 
the explosion's debri. This forced them to land..."
"This caused them to crash into the atmosphere of Planet Mobius..
where their ship turned into a ball of fire.."

The fox went white, he couldn't say anymore, he just looked at his
friend. But his friend just looked back, eventually, the poor fox had to
continue. "They managed to get out of the ship before it crashed.."

Marken sensed that his now-furrry friend could continue no longer, so
he looked at the two freedom fighters. "You probably don't like humans..
can't say I blame you seing what that Robotnik guy is like. Well, the 
pilots were humans, and you caught them with your net. They escaped,
but then you caught one again, you gave him to Robotnik in exchange
for something.."

"Tails", Sally murmurred.

"Yeah, they're a problem, got mine caught in a grate.." Mark smirked, 
"but anyway, this human kinda got on ' no-hair-day's ' nerves, who then 
decided to robodigitize him, or whatever.."

He smiled sweetly at them for a moment, "well, I can tell you, that 
I didn't entirely like him trying to turn me into a robot!"
 
Sonic stood up, "You're a human!?!" 
"No, and yes, mentally yes, physically..", he pulled his tail, "..no!"
Sally stared in amazement at him, "What happened to you?"
"Well, after I refused to give him information on weapons and
stuff, and after they TORTURED ME! Again note that I REFUSED..
I woke up in a room where I was too big to get through the 
vent in the roof..."

The hedgehog looked at him strangely, "Yes?"

"Well, then I kinda did some magic.. and... well here I am!
Oh, and I'm also not cross you nearly got me killed, so you
can calm down Mr Hedgehog."

Sonic dropped back onto the bed, then Sally looked at 
Jonathan, "Are you?.."
Marken spat out, "Come on, you can say it HUMAN. Geesh why
is it that everyone hates humans so suddenly?" 

Jonathan looked at her, "No.. not any more.."
Marken looked at her, "He's a full real-real, fox, aren't you Jon?"
"Well Yes, you see, it started today when that..."

And the conversation went on until the early hours of the morning,
with stories of adventure, daring-raids, crushing attacks and rescues
from both sides. They explained the universe of RL's, the "device"
and the Cinz, and were told about the rebellion, the king, and the land.
Finally the two GR pilots grew tired, Sonic showed them to a hut,
where they collapsed onto it's beds.

Packbell sifted through the data on the backup unit, though what he
was getting was less than usefull. He may have cracked the code 
on it, but the data itself was different. Apparently, all the diagrams
were stored in some format called BMP. From what he'd noticed
so far, two words, always located in the same position in the file,
when multiplied made up a value just smaller than the file by 
1024 bytes-- It had to be some powerfull encryption method!

He'd tried decoding it with every method he knew, fractal, 
LZW (Lorri, Zippie and Wimpie lossless compression), 
run length, 7bit, and even truecolor raw. But nothing
seemed to work. He was sure that the table of 768 bytes had
something to do with it.. but what?

He flipped to another listing, now a file called, VIEWBMP.EXE was
visible. "EXE" his mind boggled, it couldn't be the terrible 'EXCALIBUR'
encryption he had heard about, could it? 

No point in trying that file.

He changed the listing area again, now he was in the listing
called WINDOZE, from it there was another listing called
SYSTEM. He listed the files, a new file type caught his
eyes. "COM"  He'd never heard of 'COM' files before, 
perhaps it had to do with file compression, or maybe even
communications.

No point in trying that file.

Robotnik broke in, "So, how's my favourite android tonight?"
Packbell shrugged his shoulders,
"This isn't all the data, I was unable to find any programs that
would view the data files.. The only file I could even 
consider.. which was hidden, "WINE386.SWP", was
small at 21MB  for a program, failed to run on, 
  "AND", "DIMTEL", "CIRAX", and "NEXGEL" processors."

Robotnik faced the window, there was a dark black cloud
forming on the horizon, he stared at it for a long time, 
then finally turned around, walked over to his seat and sat 
down. "Packbell my boy, it's moments like these that make
me wish I hadn't robotocized all of my prisoners.."

                             Time:Night, Dreamland
****************************************************************************** 

Jonathan liked it here, there was a brook he could drink from and every tree
was laden with fruit. But from this little eden however, he could still 
find evil, for in this garden of fantasy there was a cave.

A dark cave, a cave that frightened him, a cave that held some primal fear,
whether human of vulpine. He had never been in this cave, he didn't
know what was inside. But in the darkness he knew there was enlightment. 

He stepped closer, a smell like rotten meat came to him, a hinderimg smell,
but something he had learn to bear. After all it was just an excuse to stop,
and he knew, that even if he did turn around to face back to the eden, it
would no longer be there. For intrigue ruled the night and his soul, his 
quest for power.

Heading down the dark bellows of the earth he saw a greenish ambient glow
ahead. A cold glow, a glow that spelled the truth, almost a dark glow.
Coming closer he found it to be the remaining shards of a soul-crystal, like
the one that once hung around his neck when he was in the house of "Righter."  
Alike the one he had left to the 'cave of voices' when he began his quest 
of vengeance on the Cinz. 

He picked it up, a cold chill went through him, in his sleep he whimpered,
and in his dreams a voice called out to him. He reeled around to face 
Katicha. 

He stood in the tweenworld, staring at her, "You're here.."
She smiled, "I always have been Jonathan Righter, I always have.."
"But, the Cinz.. they.. the cave.."
"Bodies are only flesh, collections of protons, neutrons and electrons,  
what makes us who we are is a soul.. The biostream, the power that inhabits
all cells in your body.. even those cells you don't want.." She pointed to
her head.
"I guess you know what happened?"
"Yes, I know.. how do you feel about it?"

He turned away for a moment, then brought his eyes back to her, "I have 
accepted it.. I don't like it.. but.. what else can I do?" 
Her voice went grim, "What is it then that bothers you?"
There was no escaping her, she knew him too well, so, he began.
"I am frightened, I don't want to stay here, I don't want to die..."

She smiled slightly, "Jonathan, a body may live forever, but a soul can't
stay in it for eternity.. You have to face the fact that oneday you too will
be released from your grip on matter.."

A tear ran down his face, "That's what scares me, my whole life I've been
free from the pincers of death.. But what happens after this?"
"Jonathan, that is something you must accept that you will never know, it
is best that you don't know it until the time is right. By questioning it, 
you only poison your body.."
"What do you mean, poison?"

She walked over to him and put her arm over his shoulder, "Your quest for
knowledge must have a limit, without it you rupture the flow of the biostream.
Even now, your body has began to die.."
He stared at her, "dying.."
"Yes. Dying.."

She bent down and picked up a large shard of green crystal on the floor, 
from it came little stars of light, they all formed together to make a 
wall of image. 

It was the hut he was sleeping in, around him stood his friend, frantically
taking his pulse. A middle age raccoon looked over him glumly, then 
turned to Marken, "I don't know what it is.. I've never seen anything like
it, he's burning up, his heart-beat is erratic.." and then, walking over,
putting a comforting arm on his shoulder, "Mark, I don't think he's going to
live long.."
Mark showed his emotions in a way never seen by anyone, "NO!" he shouted, 
"No.. there has to be something we can do?" Tears rolling down his face,
he went over to pat his comrades head. "What if his body is rejecting it's
cells, you know, like when they do heart transplants?" Booksire looked at 
him, "well, that is a possibility.."   
"And's it's one I'd like to play by, what can we get him to help?"

The image disintegrated. Jonathan looked at her, "what can I do?"
She looked into his eyes, "Jonathan, look at yourself, what are you?"
"A human" 
"Exactly, but Jonathan, what are you there.." she pointed to where the
projection had been. 
"A fox?"
"Right, you are what you are, you have to accept yourself.."
"But I have! I have!"

"No Jonathan, you tell yourself you have, in reality however, you despise 
yourself..."
He looked to the floor.. "but.. but.."
Then the lady took his hand, "Come it is time, for you to leave your body..." 
"But, will I ever come back?"
"That" she smiled, "that is your choice.."

Chaos rushed his mind, thoughts, emotions, memories, loyalties, images, faces,
people, time..      Wrapping themselves into his inner thoughts his soul
shuddered, there was so much pain.. So much torture, he could see it all now,
from the day he was born, pain, pain when he wanted to be with Clare, pain
when the Cinz killed her, pain, pain everywhere, pain in his friends, his
homeworld.. but pain in him.. Pain which turned to desire, desire that no 
matter what, told him he had to survive.

It stopped. Lying on the floor of the tweenworld, he looked up at her, "The
pain.. I have so much pain.." She grabbed his arm and lifted him up,"And only
now you have noticed it.."
"But why?" 

She walked over to the far end of the cave, then digging into the ash floor,
she removed a mirror, she brought it over to him. "Because, you have never
before been in a world of such pain.."
"What do you mean, Mobius?"
"Yes.."
"But Mobius.."

She lifted the mirror so he could see himself in it, he stared into it as
she continued. "This planet holds enough pain in it to tear itself in half,
you may have not noticed it, but your soul did. Inside every one of your 
new friends there is a driving urge, friends, family.. Pain Jonathan, more
pain than even you have ever known."

The mirror moved, the image pulled him in, faces all around, faces screaming,
bursting with pain. There were so many people, so many, he couldn't help
looking into them, their memories becoming his. Blood, tears, futility, 
they were all there. Amongst them though there was something else, the cold 
desire for revenge, the same type of desire that drove his sword through the 
last emperor of the Cinz. 

But beyond that, there was something, something he hadn't felt in years,
happiness. Happiness blossoming like a flower in a grave of skulls.

The mirror flashed, it now showed an image of a teenage fox -- him, 
he quickly looked at his body, but it was still human. He looked at the 
reflection again, it was human. Then suddenly, it changed again, reverted
back to that of a fox. The mirror cracked, it's pieces vanishing from
existance before they touched the floor.

He was a fox, and it didn't matter anymore, for whatever he became, he 
would always retain his soul. He turned to Katicha, she grinned, "Now go,
you have a task."

His mind flicked across space as his soul found his body once more.

"He's waking up.." cried Bunnie as the fox groaned out of slumber.
Rotor and Bookshire raced over to him, Bookshire being the first to speak.
"Jonathan, are you okay?"
He nodded, "uuhh, but I've got a mega headache.."
The raccoon smiled, "I might think so, you almost died lastnight.."
Jonathan went a sickly colour again, "it wasn't a dream!"
"No, I wish it were, you really had us worried.."
"Uhuu, um where is Marken?"
"Well, the Princess, Sonic and he all went to Robotropolis,
Mark said something about some backup or a ship or something.."
"Damn, I've got to help them.."
The fox tried to roll over to stand up, but Bunnie stopped him, "wait, sugah,
you ain't well enough to get up yet.."
Bookshire sympathised, "I understand your feelings son, but you have to 
get some rest.."

Jonathan looked at them futily, then with a sparkle of cunning in
his eyes began, "yes,  maybe you're right.. I don't want to die or anything.."
And with that he rolled over and closed his eyes, the three friends watched him
for a while. Eventually Bookshire spoke to them, "well, it looks like that medicine
did it's job, he's going to be just fine." Then picking up a bottle of pills, "just give
him one of these every two hours." With that the raccoon left and went back to
his hut.

"One down, two to go." Kate smiled to herself, that last planet had been
a fat load of use. How the computer ever identified it as a "LIFE-PLANET",
she would never know. The whole surface was charcoal, and floating on 
top of that there were liquid-oxygen lakes. 

Suddenly, something beeped, she looked over the controls, apparently
the computer had picked up some kind of carrier wave. "Computer, 
find source of transmission.."  She waited a moment, "Found,
signal is 200-300 years old, and originates from nav point two." 

"Well, well" she smiled," looks like I found something sentient.." 
"Computer, increase speed to 150C, and direct for Nav Point two direct.."

******************************************************************************

****************************************************************************** 
This was the last thing he wanted to do, apart from the fact that his head
was pounding, he was damp with sweat and moisture he had picked up
from dashing through the forest. He was back in the clearing, Jonathan
looked around for a moment, then stooped down to collect his pistol.
It was still there. 

He looked at it for a moment, then rubbed it dry(er) against his chest fur,
took a deep breath and looked in the direction of Mobotropolis. What was
going to ensue, he was not likely to enjoy.

Pausing for another moment, he inhaled as much air as his lungs 
could hold, and then belted off for the horizon.

****************************************************************************** 
                         Time 12:30 Outskirts of Robotropolis
****************************************************************************** 
Mark looked up at the city, then turning to Sally in disgust began," all 
this, and you can't even order a pizza.." They all chuckled for a moment,
it broke some of the tension.

Abruptly however they stopped, Sonic pointed to a tall building in the
distance.. "That one, Jon?" 
"Yipsyappie, that's the one."
"He's got to have at least a dozen swat-bots over there."
Mark gave Sonic a sickly smile, "uh hu, uh, don't look now, incoming 
6 o'clock"

The hedgehog ripped around to face three swat-bots, as he started up into his
blue-rotor, metal began to fly. More swat-bots came in, Mark began to get  
worried as they came dangerously near to him and the princess, eventually
surrounding them. 

He looked at her quick, "oh gee.. I feel so threatened.." Then picking up a 
piece of rubble and holding it near his chest he gave the "device" a command,
which he said out loud for effect, "explode shields UP!" His shield exploded
into existance--propelling the rubble at a velocity so high that if it
hadn't hit the swat-bot standing five meters away, it would have disintegrated
on it's own accord.

He smiled sarcastically, "Hey, what can I say, I'm a trained professional!"
Even the princess rolled her eyes this time, but not for too long, as more
foolish droids were trapped between the blue-blade of death and the  
particle accelarator raccoon. 

However, all good things have to come to an end, and soon both Sonic and he
found themselves out of playmates. "Too bad, I was just getting to enjoy 
that.." Marken remarked as they headed into the building.

Jonathan staggered into town, he wasn't feeling good, his brain was 
overheating while his body was flushed of energy. But he still kept 
on going, he had a mission, and he was going to see it through, even if
his vision was becoming blurry.

In the far-off distance he could see smoke, someone had been at work retro
engineering Swat-bots under a very short time factor... 
He took another deep breath, switched his pistol on, and then headed off 
towards the battle scene.

"Damn, why couldn't they encode their TV with PAL or NTSC" Kate complained to
herself. She'd moved into range of Mobius's old television transmissions 
about half an hour ago, however, due to the fact that the Mobians employed
an alternate encoding method, she was unable to get anything. 

"Computer" she dictated, "attempt do decode format.."
The computer waited a moment then replied, "Carrier signal lost."
"Damn, why did they have to close down, Computer find another frequency!"
"No carrier signals of sufficient bandwidth to store analog unencoded video
on..."
"Computer, try digital video.."
"No carrier signals of sufficient amplitude found for decoding."
"Computer, identify carrier signals.."

"Signal consistency, one low power 10.3Khz AM band, one low power digital 
128.0Khz band, one GMM digital 3.5Ghz band."
Kate's eyes exploded, "Computer, identify GR signal.."
"GR signal is of type 'data poll' from node titled "Marken Psantis", 
warbling is enabled, node is active."

"Computer, increase speed to 335C, and land at closest site to signal."
"Warning, warbling on node is enabled, would you like to continue?"
"Yes, just go!"

Princess Sally carefully cut wires as she removed the ship's data back up unit
from the computer. 
"Whoa, relax, just cut all the suckers, it's not one of those 'cut the blue 
one bombs'"  
Sally looked at Mark, "Oh yes?" she pointed to a red wire coming from the 
unit and heading into the wall. 
"Uh huh, now what is that then?" 
The princess huffed, "That is an alarm.. Mark."  
"Oh, is the crime around here really that bad?"

"Indeed it is my little freedom fighter" Robotnik glared, his laser pointing
at the three. Mark was the first to react, "please stop, the glare of your 
head is blinding me!" The raccoon edged a bit closer.

"Not so close my furry, I've seen that little trick you can do" Robotnik 
sneered, pointing the gun at the princess, "and if you come any closer, 
I would be forced to.. hurt her highness..."    

Packbell came into the room and stood by the door, Mark smiled at him, "how's
the arm mate?" Even androids are unable to compare an infinitely large 
amount of data in an instant, so he needed some reminding the raccoon 
decided. "Well, I just thought that your arm might be sore, you know, all 
that current and stuff passing through it.."

Packbell stared in amazement, "You're the human!" Mark smiled, "after seeing
what caffeine does to that species", he pointed at Robotniks dome, "I decided 
to slip into something a bit more comfortable.."

Robotnik fired, the beam just striking the wall above Sally's head, Marken 
froze for a moment considering what that shot could have done.. abruptly, for 
the first time in Robotnik's company, he shut up. 

Robotnik gave the rifle to Packbell, and then waltzed over to the window, 
stared out for a moment, then turning around he glared at Sonic. "You
know, today might actually turn out to be quite good. After I rid the planet 
of you hedgehog." Sonic glared back, "I don't think so 'buttnik!"
But the overlord continued unhindered, "..We'll see what the freedom fighters 
have to say when their princess has been captured!" 
Sally looked at him stunned, "In your wildest dreams!" but she secretely
trembled with fear.

"Wait!" began Mark, "What about me.. don't I get a part in this? I don't
believe it, I break in here, bother the hell out of you, plant a bomb of
immense power in your basement.. and I still.."
Robotnik stared in fright for a moment, "Bomb?"
"Whoops, damn, guess we're all going to be carbon-crispies, well, at least
let me tell you, I really enjoyed playing. And you were a great guy and 
all..."
"What bomb is this?"
"Oh well.., " Marken smiled, "I guess seeing that there is no way you can 
get off the planet in the next two minutes, I can tell you that it's one 
of the thermonuclear warheads off my ship.. Fusion type that is, you see
what you do, is take hydrogen gas and ionize it, after it has become 
hydrogen ions, you ionize a bit more, and then a whole series of nuclei 
fuse together to make helium, in the process a great deal of energy is 
released. Now, uuh, I'd just like to remind you that after the planet has
cooled down again, all our atoms should make a nice new world in the 
proximity of two billion years."

Packbell himself froze with fear, all the missiles on the crashed  
ship he'd inspected were wrecked, but he'd never been able to find one of 
them. Little did he know that the missile had been used on the Cinz. 
Mark looked at them both, "well before we all go vapouro,
do you mind if I give you a hug.. I mean after all, we are kind of like,
..were cousins.. you know and all.."

But Robotnik was not shaken, "before demise there is still time to make you
suffer, I'm going to let you see one another die.." 
Marken chuckled, "Let Sonic kill us, or we're going to run out of time!" 

Rototnik glared at Sally, "You know, I knew your father, he was like you.. 
foolish!" Then pointing at her and looking back to the android, "Packbell, 
my boy, will you do the honours?"

He smiled and aimed the rifle for what seemed like an eternity, during which 
time the young princess shuddered with utter fear. There was an explosion of
light as the gun he held blazed. 

Sally opened her eyes,  she was still there, she looked around to see both 
Mark and Sonic also very much in existance. A voice from the doorway called
out, "Miss me?  Hey, I made a pun Mark!" A rough looking fox appeared 
at the doorway, bringing a bit of nature with him in the form of leaves,
thorns and vines stuck in his fur.

Packbell stared at what remained of his rifle as Jonathan walked into the 
room, pointing his pistol at Robotnik. "Ivo Robotnik, I find you guilty on
the charge of treason, retro mechanics, unlawfull rule and murder, you 
are hereby sentenced to death, to be carried out immediately by a weapon 
of GR agents choice.."

He pulled the trigger--too late, Packbell sweeped his legs out from behind, 
he fell backward, the shot went far--striking the ceiling above Robotonik, 
but before the fox's skull had impacted the floor, he squeezed out one 
more shot, this time striking Packbell in the chest. The android's body 
flew back striking the edge of the doorway, Jonathan was knocked out
cold on the hard metal floor, his gun bounced twice before sliding along the
floor and stopping at the feet of princess Sally.

After a moment of hesitation she picked it up, then slowly pointed it at 
Robotnik. 
Mark laughed, "geesh, now what was that you said about the king being stupid?" 
Robotnik stared at the princess, time froze, and for a moment to princess
Sally, it felt like their stares were the only thing in the universe.
Slowly he began backing towards the doorway, while Marken's
voice echoed out, "Shoot him, Shoot HIM!, SHOOT HIM!" 

The ad lib echoing of voices caused chaos in her mind, all the suffering,
pain, killing, destruction... but still she could not bring herself to do
this. But she knew she had to, Robotnik was already nearing the doorway.

She clenched her eyes shut, Time stopped, the trigger clicked as it was  
pressed, the echo of plasma surging from the barrel and a
short cut-off scream resounded off the walls for what seemed like an 
eternity. 

And it was over.

When she opened her eyes again he was gone, the only reminder that he'd ever
been there--a piece of metallic scrap that once manifested as his 
robotocized arm. Mark's voice went serious, "That's for Barney.. the next
one will be for Mobius.."

She looked at Sonic, stunned from what she'd just done, she dropped the gun,
grabbed the hedgehog into an embrace and held him there for what seemed 
like an eternity. Mark picked up the gun. "Nice shooting princess, I 
just know the next time you try that, you'll waste him so bad!"
"What!?!" 
"I said next time you shoot him, you'll kill him for sure.."
"b..b..But.."
"Well the main thing is, you disarmed him.. 'Disarmed' him, get it..."
The princess looked at him, "..but.. didn't I?"
"Nope, you just blew his arm off, if you'd hit him full on, you'd be washing
bits of him out of your hair tonight.."

There was a noise down the hall as Swat-Bots came scuttling up it. Mark 
looked up, "looks like it's time to play again.."

Between cutting blows delivered by Sonic, and burts of 
super-highly-ionized-gas delivered from Marken, Sally was able to look at 
Jonathan. His head was hot, but not as hot as it had been the night before,
he was breathing okay, his pulse was weak but not erratic. She patted him
softly on the head. (and removed a thorny vine from it too!) 

"Holy shit, how many of them are there Bigblue?" Marken screamed, as another
laser was stopped by the "device." Sonic stopped grinding for a moment, 
"We've gotta get out of here!"
"You're telling me.. OK, I'm gonna jump out left from this door, that's where
they seem to be coming from. Grab the princess and fox-brain, busticate that
stupid backup thing and then get the freaking blue blazing laser trailing
hell out of here! Don't worry.. I'll be right behind you.."

Marken watched Sonic cut through the unit, "well, there go any hopes of
getting of this planet" he sighed, "but, hey I like getting shot!" 
He took a breath, brushed his fingers through his hair, smiled, then
dived out, seeing more robots than he'd ever done in his life. Every
one of them with a rifle, but in a digital multitask they were all..well
offline. He then followed Sonic down the passage until they came to a locked 
door. 

The door didn't remain locked for long, as the blue streak tore through it. 
Suddenly he stopped, they were now on a launchpad, about twenty stories up,
and to add to it all, they came face to face with a ship floating in midair. 
"Draconis-II!" Mark yelled as it fired a missile towards them. There
was an explosion as a group of foolish Swat-Bots attempting to sneak up behind 
them turned into shrapnel.

Over the ship's loudspeaker came Kate's collected voice, "Whoo, hello, 
could I interest you in a lift?" 
Mark grinned, "Hurry up and open the doors WOMEN!" 

And that she did, and as the ship flew towards the forest, Marken continued
his joking, this time about interior space, seating in available colours and
why to make sure to get the leather seats if you had a tail.

He woke up in her arms, Jonathan looked up into Kate's eyes, and for the
first time in his life he saw something in them he'd never done before. 
She cuddled him close for at least ten minutes before telling him how 
afraid she was that she'd lose him. 

Outside the ship a celebration was going on, and after a few more minutes
talking with her, he went out to join it. When he emerged from the doorway
there was a cheering as the freedom fighters welcomed him back to the
realm of conscience. 

He smiled like he'd never done before, once again in his life he had those
two feelings that had become so distant to him--Love and Happiness.

Later as that day turned to night, Marken found his friend sat alone on a 
log once more. He sat down next to him, "What's up bro.." 
Jonathan smiled, "Mark, have you ever noticed how beautiful the night sky is?" 
His comrade laughed, putting his hand on his head to feel for a temprature.
They both laughed and headed back to the party...

The Draconis II's plasma-fusion engines whined as they powered up for take 
off throwing dust up into a chaotic state.. 

"Where in the hell is fox-brain?" asked Mark.
Kate just smiled, "relax Mark, I'm in no hurry to get back, after all, I am
going to get court-marshalled.."
He chuckled, "Well, I think I'm going to have a little chat with Craig about 
that.. eh?"

In another part of the forest Jonathan said his goodbye's to Sonic and Sally.
"You're sure you don't all want to come back with us, there's plenty of
planets in RL9 that look like this.."    Sally smiled, hugging Sonic a bit
closer, and what she said echoed in Jonathan's mind as his ship sped away
from Mobius.

"We want to stay here, we want to fight, someone has to stop Robotnik, 
and one day we will. We will continue in honour of those who died for our
cause, for those who no longer have any choice... And in hope of oneday
restoring Mobius and it's citizens to what they once were." 

He looked at the planet growing rapidly smaller, until it's solar system became
just another star in the sky, then finally after a moment of thought, he  
closed his eyes. "Freedom from the evils of men, tortured freedom."
And with that he dropped into the realm of soft untroubled dreams.

The ship that landed at GRB-II a day and a half later however was less than
complete.. a letter on Princess Sally's bed attached to a hemispherical
device summed it up.

Princess Sally,

The device I have left you is part of the
warhead of one of the Draconis II's missiles.  It is 
effectively a port'al spawner. I have programmed 
it with the co-ordinates of my Earth Gate.

If ever a matter of Dire danger should occur,
use it.. Also, protect the device at all costs, it
is the key to my world of humans.. "Earth"

Farewell

The End.. Hope you all enjoyed the story, and in case you didn't I'm
glad I just wasted two-hours off your life while you read this...

Well, until my next story, whatever it may be, I will as Marken Psantis
might say.. "Grip those sucking gribes and ride 'em like a horse 
through LA in rush hour!"
Or as Jonathan Righter might say, "Get back in my car and drive away..."
Or as Craig might say, "modify my spacial co-ordinates."
Or as Kate might say , "Get the hell outta here!"
Or as Sonic might say, "Cruise.."

Or as I might say...
