Greetings:
<br />

<br />
The following is from a letter my brother sent me after watching STH
<br />
(specifically, both installments of &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; and the sort of
<br />
lame two-parter that followed (I can't access the ep list at the
<br />
moment).  I'll say no more and let his comments speak for themselves.  I
<br />
do invite responses which I intend to pass along.
<br />

<br />
========================================================================
<br />

<br />
(excerpted from a letter dated 1/27/95):
<br />

<br />
Well, you can't say that I didn't give it a chance.  This past Saturday
<br />
(1/7) I tuned in Sonic to see what was doing.  At first I thought the
<br />
entire premise of the show dealt with reverse time travel, but
<br />
apparently it was just the one episode.
<br />

<br />
The major influence on that episode was &quot;Quantum Leap&quot; -- the computer
<br />
with the holograms (whose name escapes me, even though the show ended
<br />
about 20 minutes ago) was a direct cop from Ziggy in QL, as was the
<br />
whole notion of going back to the past to change the present/future.
<br />
(Actually, the first &quot;Terminator&quot; movie covered some of the same
<br />
ground).
<br />

<br />
It's hard for me to avoid deeper criticism of pop culture, so brace
<br />
yourself.  The nature/machine dichotomy has pretty much been done to
<br />
death, from George Lucas' Ewoks to (on a more pessimistic note) H. G.
<br />
Wells' &quot;Time Machine&quot;.  Basically, though, the roboticizer (?) suggested
<br />
to me the Borg episodes of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;.  All of
<br />
this goes back to the same anti-mechanical impulses that gave rise to
<br />
the Luddites in 19th Century England.  The whole tendency (although not,
<br />
oddly enough, the Luddites) is discussed in two of [my brother's wife's]
<br />
favorite books: Leo Marx's &quot;The Machine In The Garden&quot; and David Shi's
<br />
&quot;The Simple Life,&quot; both of which I commend to your attention.
<br />

<br />
This tendency was carried on in the hyena sequence of the 1/14 program.
<br />
That bugs me, only because there are pastorals out there that are much
<br />
more honest about nature being, in Tennyson's phrase, &quot;red in tooth and
<br />
claw&quot;.  For example, I've been rereading &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; after years
<br />
away from it: Kipling's colonialist politics aside, I'd forgotten his
<br />
abilities as a writer, and his willingness to include death in his view
<br />
of life.  Maybe Sonic doesn't have to go the Kipling route, but
<br />
describing the hyenas as &quot;cannibal&quot;, while it suggests the universal
<br />
bond of all life, makes carnivores seem aberrant.  Yet the foxes in the
<br />
series should also be considered aberrant, since they are--or should
<br />
be--carnivores.  The series sidesteps this problem by infantilizing the
<br />
foxes, keeping them at a child (at best, adolescent) stage of
<br />
development.  These anthropomorphs' ancestor is, of course, Bugs Bunny,
<br />
whom Richard Adams once dismissed as &quot;a guy in a rabbit suit&quot; who had
<br />
nothing to do with real rabbits.
<br />

<br />
As for the lead Sonic characters, there doesn't seem to be much one can
<br />
do with them except use them for their original purpose; the series is,
<br />
after all, a half-hour commercial for Sega.  The Boss [Robotnik?] is
<br />
one-dimensional, but Sonic, Sally and the other forest-folk barely make
<br />
it to two-dimensional.  If I had to write anything for these critters,
<br />
I'd have to invent a lot of biography and motivation along the way.  The
<br />
character design is nice, but (a) the studio is borrowing Sega's designs
<br />
and (b) the studio is, after all, DIC, which has done some good work; I
<br />
still think &quot;The Littles&quot; was a couple of steps above the usual Saturday
<br />
AM run.
<br />

<br />
Beyond that, and their essentially adolescent perspective, Sonic and
<br />
Sally still pretty much embody the gender stereotyping of commercial
<br />
television: she's Appollonian, the planning aspect, while he's the
<br />
active, unthinking Dionysian counterpart.  You rarely see a female
<br />
protagonist, animated or otherwise, who deviates from this.  One of the
<br />
few, though, who I did like, was Gadget Hackwrench from the &quot;Rescue
<br />
Rangers&quot;.  She combined thinker and actor, and was strong enough to
<br />
assert her own personality in a male-dominated mileau.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The preceeding opinion does not necessarily reflect my own.  In fact, it
<br />
doesn't.
