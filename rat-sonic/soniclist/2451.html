Super Sonic V. Hyper Knuckles Special #1 [no date]
<br />
&quot;Crash Of The Titans&quot;
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
OK, kids, let's sing the theme song!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fight 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fight and bite and fight
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bite bite bite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fight fight fight
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Itchy and Scratchy...oops...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sonic and Knuckles Show!
<br />
What can you say about a story where the basic plot can be summed
<br />
up as: &quot;Sonic and Knuckles try to beat each other up; after
<br />
finding a hidden level, they warp into Super Sonic and Hyper
<br />
Knuckles...and try to beat each other up&quot;?  What can you say
<br />
about a story that features no less than TEN editorial box
<br />
comments by Scott Fulop?  My term paper should have as many
<br />
footnotes!  What can you say about a story like that?  Quite a
<br />
bit, actually.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic intercepts Knuckles just as the latter is approaching
<br />
an abandoned pond in sight of Robotropolis.  This pretty much
<br />
signals the beginning of round 1, though Sally shows up a short
<br />
time later once a tree gets uprooted in the fight: &quot;When the
<br />
landscape starts to suffer, I step in.&quot;  Detectng radiation
<br />
reading using Nicole, Sally peers into the hole left by the
<br />
uprooted tree.  It's a classic missed opportunity for Sonic and
<br />
Knuckles, for they're so busy glaring at each other that they
<br />
don't seem to realize that they're in the perfect position to get
<br />
an eyeful of Acorn booty.  &quot;Don't be shy, boys!  Take a look down
<br />
here!&quot;  Indeed!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've voiced my opinion about Gallagher's jokey scripts in
<br />
the past; this time around, he largely keeps it in check.  He
<br />
also gives Sally an amazing aside totally out of left field which
<br />
I will NOT spoil.  The curious can read it on page 13.  Gallagher
<br />
may specialize in screwball gag writing, but apparently he can
<br />
throw a mean curve when he has to.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in the zone, Sonic and Knuckles each collect enough
<br />
trinkets to power up and resume their fight.  In order to bring
<br />
this to an end, the two buttheads butt heads with sufficient
<br />
force that the zone collapses (&quot;I felt a great disturbance in the
<br />
Force, Luke!&quot;).  Sonic comes to as Sally provides about a page of
<br />
exposition.  She also gives Sonic a ride home on a &quot;sky-cycle&quot;
<br />
though Scott's editorial box neatly conceals the view of Sonic's
<br />
hands around Sally's waist -- party pooper!  (Though from what I
<br />
can see of the placement of Sonic's left hand, it's either just
<br />
gesturing or else was drawn wrong and the box serves the purpose
<br />
of an artistic fig leaf.  Sonic's left hand should have been
<br />
obscured by Sally's back instead of blocking her right side.  I
<br />
know, I know: everybody's an art critic!).  Knuckles has to
<br />
settle for a spare Chaos Emerald as a consolation prize.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story, though minimal, is better than expected.  Perhaps
<br />
Gallagher needed Mawhinney's brilliant (as usual) art as a
<br />
steadying influence.  Some bad jokes that strain the fourth wall
<br />
(particularly Robotnik's cameo role), and Sonic and Knuckles seem
<br />
at times like they're trying to talk each other to death, but a
<br />
good combination on the whole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders; Art: Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story begins with a younger Knuckles being given a tour
<br />
of the island by his father, who sports a short beard and whose
<br />
white belted jacket means either that he and Luke Skywalker buy
<br />
their clothes from the same store, or else he operates a dojo on
<br />
the side.  Turns out, in mid-tour, we learn we're in mid-
<br />
flashback.  The words Knuckles heard his father use have been
<br />
quoted at him by Archimedes.  After another flashback concerning
<br />
Knuckles' problem-solving strategy (when in doubt, punch it out),
<br />
we learn that the island also has a Forbidden Zone and that this
<br />
was where Knuckles' father turned over guardianship of the island
<br />
before leaving his son.  I won't say how, exactly, but let's just
<br />
say that Knuckles' old man sure knows how to make an exit!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;VERY impressive layout on the top of page 7 and in the upper
<br />
left panels of page 8.  Though I prefer dialogue to soliloquy,
<br />
the latter was effectively used.  So it looks like, after months
<br />
of 2-page vamping, we're getting ready to get on with the
<br />
Knuckles story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S.: a 1-page ad displays the covers for Sonic #34 (is
<br />
Sonic being captured by Uncle Chuck?), and all three Knuckles
<br />
miniseries covers...as if the resumption of the Knuckles solo
<br />
story in #34 weren't enough.  If I were Knuckles, I'd ask for
<br />
more money!
