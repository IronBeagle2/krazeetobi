Date: Wed, 5 Jun 1996 16:03:23 -0400 (EDT)
<br />
From: Erich Schulman (KTN4CA) Team OS/2 &lt;acme_at_use.usit.net&gt;
<br />
To: Sonic Post &lt;sonic_at_lists.mv.net&gt;
<br />
Subject: I've returned ...
<br />

<br />
... to what?!
<br />

<br />
When it rains, it pours.  First, I am forced to move to a new apartment 
<br />
with little notice.  Then my computer is damaged in the move and I had to 
<br />
get a new motherboard.  Then my video card's ROM chip is found to be 
<br />
dead, so it's new video card time.  All shipped expensively overnight.  
<br />
And now that I've rejoined the net, I come home to 700 waiting messages 
<br />
and the shock of discovering that the list is being dissolved.  After 
<br />
informing Ratman by voice of my equipment problems, the last thing I 
<br />
expected was to come back to nothing.
<br />

<br />
You are not going to see me very much in the a.f.s-h newsgroup.  This is 
<br />
because posts from pine on this provider rarely get out, and my US 
<br />
Internet either doesn't know how to fix nn (it's been broken 11 months) 
<br />
or they refuse to.  As for #sonic, IRC has proven to be more grief than I 
<br />
can deal with so I'm deleting mIRC and giving up.  I will probably ask 
<br />
Alexei on FurToonia if I can have a second character in case anyone wants 
<br />
to correspond with me that way; very few people know who my present FT 
<br />
character is and I intend to keep it that way.  I will keep my 
<br />
acme_at_use.usit.net address until and if a better ISP that offers shell 
<br />
access opens in my community.
<br />

<br />
Though I cannot achieve the level of automation possible with majordomo, 
<br />
it is possible for me to run a replacement list on this account.  I have 
<br />
enough knowledge of pine and shell scripts to make this reasonably 
<br />
practical.  I also have a friend on FurToonia whose provider offers 
<br />
mailing lists; I don't know what their fees are.  Some long-time members 
<br />
of this list may recall that my original intention was to run this list 
<br />
off my Delphi account, with the aid of software I would write myself.  I 
<br />
am no longer on Delphi, but I still can write software, and writing shell 
<br />
scripts to use with pine is a better solution than trying to write a 
<br />
dedicated mailing list manager for my own PC.
<br />

<br />
I can port the Merchandise List to my personal Webspace without much 
<br />
difficulty, but there is no possibility I can offer even 10% of all the 
<br />
files now stored on rat.org in this way.  At least I had downloaded a lot 
<br />
of them while I had the chance.  I've also maintained my own list 
<br />
archives since Day 1.
<br />

<br />
Over its 16 month life, I've seen this list through good times and bad:  
<br />
from the hard work and dedication of our faq-dd keeper (Dan Drazen) to 
<br />
the ill-will of a bitter netizen who never did subscribe (name 
<br />
intentionally omitted), from Archie Comics and Sega establishing their 
<br />
presence on the list to dealing with 2 mailbombing threats :(, and from 
<br />
our first story posting and the spawning of Bookshire's page to dealing 
<br />
with our first and only net.spam attack.
<br />

<br />
And to Ratman, I owe a great debt of gratitude, and not just for no-cost 
<br />
use of the majordomo server, a shell account, and ftp site, but also for 
<br />
those things you can't place price tags on:  experience in people 
<br />
administration and management, a taste of the day to day grit you deal 
<br />
with on the &quot;supply&quot; side of an information system, a reason to read RFC 
<br />
821 (g), and a small yet permanent part of Internet history.  I even owe 
<br />
the creation of my FurToonia character to the encouragement of one-time 
<br />
list member Craig Moore and list member Alessandro Sanasi.
<br />

<br />
I don't know how many tens of on and offline hours I have put into this list 
<br />
since its planning stages in January 1995.  Losing this will be more 
<br />
burden than relief, for I have lost not just a job but a part of myself --
<br />
the part fueling 1.5 lines of my .signature.  I am deeply disappointed 
<br />
this is all coming to an end so soon and so suddenly -- and that I had to 
<br />
find out the way that I did.
<br />

<br />
Though we didn't always see eye-to-eye on administrative and technical 
<br />
issues (and certainly not on operating systems (g)), Ratman is a fine man 
<br />
to work for, and I knew I could always count on him to help whenever I 
<br />
was in over my head.  It is absolutely no understatement or exaggeration 
<br />
that he has helped me more for free than US Internet's help desk has for 
<br />
fee.  Though I may be several years his senior (and maybe the #2 or #3 
<br />
oldest on the list), his knowledge and experience outpace mine by such 
<br />
leaps and bounds I am left not worthy to touch his floppy disks.  Without 
<br />
reservation, I wish Ratman and Scratchwood all the best personally and 
<br />
professionally as we go our seperate ways.
<br />

<br />
Finally, to all present and former subscribers, thank you for helping 
<br />
make the Sonic list a success.  We certainly could not have been the 
<br />
group we were without you.
