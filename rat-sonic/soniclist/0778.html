<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the hut that he and Tails shared, he knocked
<br />
on the door to signal his brother.  He heard Tails walk from the
<br />
bed to the door with his noise ranging circuitry counting every
<br />
otherwise imperceptible impact on the floor.  The door slid
<br />
easily past the entryway, and his vulpine familiar was standing
<br />
before him, prepared to permit him passage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David spoke first.  &quot;Freedom Fighter Commander Delivery
<br />
Service,&quot; he dictated, as if trained to do so.  &quot;If I'm not
<br />
mistaken, I believe I have your order.  And you are...Tails, am
<br />
I right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails chuckled at first, but then noticed something unusual
<br />
about his relative.  &quot;Eeew, David.  What happened?&quot; he
<br />
questioned, before he pinched his nose to hold back the stench.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A very enthusiastic dragon happened to me,&quot; the drenched black
<br />
and gray fox replied.  &quot;If I may be permitted...?&quot; he asked,
<br />
indicating the bathroom.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sured, goo rgiht ahaed,&quot; the other said, refusing to disengage
<br />
the fingerlock from his nose before David was in a slightly more
<br />
presentable condition.  He kept a vigilant watch on his family
<br />
member before the other disappeared into the bathroom for a
<br />
shower.  After the door closed, Tails let out a long hard
<br />
breath, attempting  to recover from the temporary constriction
<br />
of his sinuses.  He then walked over to the bunk bed, and took
<br />
his position on the top bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David came out from the shower five minutes later, smelling
<br />
like he had used copious amounts of shampoo and deodorant to
<br />
dispel the evil aroma.  His fur was still slightly damp and
<br />
frizzled from the static electricity, creating the image of a
<br />
black and gray fuzzball.  After reactivating his antistatic
<br />
subdermal field, his fur returned to its original orientation
<br />
flat on his skin.  He then traveled to the bunk bed to join his
<br />
comrade.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean Dulcy did that to you?&quot; the red vulpine asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ascending to the top bed, the counterpart said, &quot;Yes, Tails,
<br />
she did.&quot;  After reaching the bed, he crawled over to sit by his
<br />
confidant.  &quot;Merely part of being a Freedom Fighter Commander.
<br />
You receive the opportunity to know your people more...&quot; he
<br />
stuttered, his electronic thesaurus failing to find a word that
<br />
would properly express the situation.  He found none that filled
<br />
the requirements, even taking the clock/instruction speed into
<br />
account by every attosecond.  &quot;Intimately,&quot; he finally ventured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Eeeew!  All that kissing and stuff, it's gross, David!  Yuck!&quot;
<br />
came the derisive reply from his kinfox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not completely undesirable, Tails.  Besides, from what
<br />
I've seen between you, Nina, and Vixie, I would have considered
<br />
you to be less reserved on such matters,&quot; the compuorganic
<br />
jovially retorted.  The only response he got from his brother
<br />
was a significantly slackened lower jaw.  Stolidly maintaining
<br />
his grin, David continued, &quot;I rest my case.  And don't be
<br />
concerned;  it's our little secret.&quot;  He saw the other's stress
<br />
potentials decrease with each second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Calm enough to speak again, Tails submitted in interest, &quot;How
<br />
far did it go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing beyond an delightful embrace and an excellent kissing
<br />
session,&quot; David returned, knowing exactly what his
<br />
relative-by-law was ultimately referring to.  He sighed with
<br />
resignation.  &quot;We are too junior in age and inexperienced to
<br />
concern ourselves with expanding our horizons in that fashion.&quot;
<br />
The electronic thesaurus didn't fail David this time in his
<br />
search for the appropriate phrase.  &quot;Although,&quot; he continued
<br />
more seriously, &quot;that will not be the case for you in the near
<br />
future.  As for myself, I may never know.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What David was referring to was the fact that Tails had just
<br />
turned a year older in the late summer, effectively making him
<br />
eleven years old.  This would only be the beginning of the
<br />
experiences that Tails would have, and probably would peak
<br />
around his thirteenth year.  Basically stated, it would be the
<br />
time that he would publicly and privately become more interested
<br />
in the opposite sex, and Tails was already on his uphill race
<br />
toward that mountain peak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for David, he was a recent construct, so it was far too soon
<br />
to determine what his reactions would be.  In his upgrade
<br />
session that he made to prevent the threat of total
<br />
deactivation, he added multiple computer controls to the organic
<br />
counterparts, in order for him to maintain a higher level of
<br />
control over the organic body functions.  This included
<br />
regulation of his hormonal levels, appended with controls on
<br />
their &quot;target cells&quot;.  The end result:  David had duplex
<br />
negative feedback loops (organic/computer) to delimit his body
<br />
functions in a homeostatic balance.  The possibility of his
<br />
organic system revolting was possible, even in his advanced
<br />
control state;  however, it was highly improbable.  In the event
<br />
that did occur, David's personality was &quot;hard-encoded&quot; in both
<br />
his positronic and organic brain components, with a small
<br />
percentage of provisional rewritable code which would be
<br />
analyzed intensively before incorporation.  He would still have
<br />
strict control, and any hormonal imbalances were more likely to
<br />
be deliberately induced, in &quot;proaction&quot; with a situation rather
<br />
than &quot;reaction&quot;.  In other words, he would take control as much
<br />
as possible;  not be the subject of control by the situation.
<br />
There were, of course, rare cases where David was more likely to
<br />
&quot;react&quot;, due to his focusing on another subject matter rather
<br />
than everything at once.  He was advanced;  not perfect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What everyone else at Knothole regarded in David wasn't his
<br />
technical aspects or vulnerabilities.  They treated him more
<br />
like a close friend;  not a highly advanced machine.  Their
<br />
comrade had feelings too, whether they were generated from what
<br />
&quot;emotions&quot; could be defined as, or from computer coding.  It
<br />
made no difference, because they existed regardless of their
<br />
origin.  One of the more prominent pieces of his personality was
<br />
his mental maturity.  Even though David was constructed as an
<br />
eleven year-old fox, he behaved like someone far beyond the
<br />
maturity of all the Knothole residents combined.  He had been
<br />
(and still was) accused of being more &quot;adult&quot; than the adults in
<br />
Knothole, astonishing for someone of his age.  He never looked
<br />
on the attribute as a proof of superiority;  to him, it was part
<br />
of his mental programming that made him the unique fox he was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't sell yourself short, David,&quot; the loving scion decreed.
<br />
&quot;You can still grow up, right?  Is there more you can do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The philosophical one conceded.  &quot;Yes, I can.  Mentally, I
<br />
still have the capability to develop, and I could be accused of
<br />
being more adult than everyone else than before.  As far as my
<br />
endoskeleton is concerned, it's capable of minor controlled
<br />
growth, and THAT is only for any necessary repairs to the
<br />
metallic frame.  Nothing more.&quot;  He paused for a second,
<br />
projecting at least one million times how his future would be
<br />
compared to his relative.  &quot;From the probable outcome, Tails,&quot;
<br />
he continued, &quot;I will be your little brother for quite some
<br />
time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; the other reported kindly, &quot;maybe in height, but you'll
<br />
always be a big brother to me in heart.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David was disconcerted by the return.  &quot;Thank you, Tails.  I
<br />
had no knowledge that you felt that way about me,&quot; visibly taken
<br />
aback by the unexpected delivery.  One of the rare times where
<br />
he could only react.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I do, David,&quot; Tails said, imitating an earlier statement.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;Merely part of being a Freedom Fighter Commander's brother.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No laughter passed between them, but they did smile as they
<br />
hugged each other reverently.  David then dropped to the floor
<br />
and took his position in his bed.  The fox pair fell asleep in a
<br />
matter of seconds, for all was right in the world for them now.
<br />
Tomorrow was another day to be concerned with, but only tomorrow
<br />
would it be met with tenacity.  Now was a time for sleep;  an
<br />
intensive day was ahead.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally in order for David to sleep, a audio filter program
<br />
lies active, disregarding undesired noise that would otherwise
<br />
keep him awake at night.  Some of those sounds included:  wind
<br />
passing through leaves, footsteps (those identified as
<br />
&quot;friendly&quot;), snoring, and various other noises.  One of the
<br />
audio patterns that was permitted to bypass the filter was the
<br />
knocking on the hut door.  And the power of the bypassed audio
<br />
was so powerful (though in actuality, it was a tapping), that
<br />
could feel his entire body resonating with the sound.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Signal from doorway,' his mind automatically registered after
<br />
determining the range and direction.  Investigating his internal
<br />
chronometer, he thought, '0250 hours 36.798969695055 seconds?!
<br />
This had better be important.'  He slowly rose from his bed, and
<br />
walked to the doorway.  He opened the door, and found Dulcy
<br />
standing before him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy,&quot; he asked in a whisper, &quot;what purpose have you arrived
<br />
here to serve?&quot;  He was somewhat irritated from the inauspicious
<br />
time for waking up, but (thankfully) his verbal frequency
<br />
circuits smoothed out the harsh tones that were not so
<br />
well-intended.  Unfortunately, the same was not true for his
<br />
facial expression.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I'm sorry to wake you up so early, David,&quot; the dragon
<br />
replied apologetically.  &quot;Maybe I should come back at a better
<br />
time.&quot;  She began rotating her body to permit her departure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, wait,&quot; David ordered, warmly this time.  &quot;I'm already
<br />
awake, so you may speak to me if you so intend.  Just maintain a
<br />
low whisper.  Tails isn't as amiable as I am from being woken up
<br />
at this time of day,&quot; he said, indicating the slumbering Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK,&quot; the dragon reassured.  After entering, she said, &quot;I'm
<br />
really glad that you decided to take me on a mission, David.
<br />
Things are really getting a little cramped around here, with the
<br />
feeling that nearly everyone is breathing down my neck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I understand,&quot; the vulpine concurred.  &quot;It's gratifying to see
<br />
that you are still willing to undertake such a task, considering
<br />
the stress you have been experiencing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well,&quot; she responded, &quot;you really woke me up, David.
<br />
Told me that I still have a chance to do something right for a
<br />
change, and that someone still believes in me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sometimes, Dulcy,&quot; the fox said philosophically, &quot;that's part
<br />
of what we need.  But believing in yourself is the most
<br />
important aspect.  Otherwise, all the care and attention in the
<br />
world won't make a difference;  it has to originate from YOU.
<br />
Do you truthfully feel confident enough in yourself to take that
<br />
first step?&quot; he said while pointing to her for emphasis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I do,&quot; she said solemnly.  &quot;I WILL do my best today.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In that event,&quot; he began, &quot;I suggest that you go to sleep.
<br />
Otherwise, your best will not be enough to assist you in
<br />
attaining the goals you seek for the future.&quot;  He notated the
<br />
time on the wall video display.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She yawned in agreement.  &quot;Oops, excuse me.  I am kinda pooped.
<br />
&nbsp;Thanks a lot, David,&quot; the dragon said, and offered her paw.  He
<br />
returned the gesture, and she shook his paw with a strong,
<br />
determined grip.  That was all the persuasion that David
<br />
required to know that Dulcy was ready to face one of her worst
<br />
problems.  His presence strengthened the promise she made to
<br />
herself, for she knew that she and David would succeed where
<br />
others had failed.  She then lumbered out the doorway, on route
<br />
to her hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night, Dulcy,&quot; her respected comrade called softly to her
<br />
as he followed, stopping at the porch.  &quot;And don't allow anyone
<br />
to defile your determination.  We will show all of Knothole that
<br />
you can land with the best of the dragons, or in this
<br />
instructive case, foxes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chuckled, then continued on her way home.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, David woke up at 0800 hours to begin his
<br />
preparation for the planetary search for food, raw material, and
<br />
habitation areas.  After running the strongly recommended
<br />
full-spectrum diagnostic on his major and minor compuorganic
<br />
components, he slowly rose from bed and walked to the AVDO
<br />
(Audio/Video/Digital/Other) wall unit.  His stealthy subroutines
<br />
automatically engaged, for his brother was still peacefully
<br />
sleeping the early morning away.  He investigated the final
<br />
official reports from the fracas that occurred yesterday and
<br />
many of the previous days before, and had his mood set for the
<br />
day.  The report told him that, basically, the situation was
<br />
worse than he and Sonic anticipated.  Data from the Northern
<br />
Freedom Fighter group predicted that the early winter cold front
<br />
was advancing faster than the original calculations suggested,
<br />
and that the major ground-level supply routes to/from that area
<br />
would be impassable in the next seven days.  The tunnels would
<br />
still be operative, yet they had a cantankerous habit of
<br />
delaying shipments due to cave-ins and other minor geologic
<br />
processes seeking a more stable state.  As for Knothole, the
<br />
front would arrive in the next eleven days, effectively
<br />
arresting all cargo and other transport to/from the area.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On another note, there were increasing levels of unrest
<br />
gradually increasing in Knothole.  This was partially due to the
<br />
overcrowding, and to rumors floating around that the food supply
<br />
was possibly not of sufficient amount to feed the entire
<br />
resident population in the duration of the long winter.
<br />
Apparently, the rumor itself was somewhat pervasive, given the
<br />
fact that Knothole was literally flooded with people, and a
<br />
minuscule (but significant) percentage of them were prone to
<br />
gossip broadcasting.  Not very conductive to an already
<br />
precarious situation.  Videos of potential rioting in his mind's
<br />
eye came forth, a prediction of the near future if the situation
<br />
was allowed to conglomerate more and more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If David could curse, the appropriate time would be now.  He
<br />
held the temptation at bay, not even acknowledging it in the
<br />
privacy of his thoughts.  He would not progress all this way to
<br />
become notorious for profanity, even if only to himself.  He
<br />
combated the undesired emotional response, having the benefit of
<br />
a secondary negative feedback system to minimize the properties
<br />
of it and transport it to a null data core.  Yet the residual
<br />
effects of it still lingered...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compuorganic vulpine then downloaded other, more
<br />
immediately important, data into his dynamic provisional memory:
<br />
&nbsp;analysis of readiness for the mission that he and Dulcy would
<br />
embark on in the next two hours.  He began searching through the
<br />
equipment closet for the required supplies for the trip, while
<br />
downloading data via a remote low-level RF connection to the
<br />
library computer in Rotor's workshop.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After David was satisfied with the level of data that he felt
<br />
would be pertinent to the mission, he quietly exited the hut and
<br />
walked toward the workshop that Rotor and Bookshire shared in
<br />
their mutual inventive moods.  He had all but one very
<br />
significant piece of information, and that didn't serve to
<br />
improve the compuorganic fox's attitude.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Rotor and Bookshire must be getting progressively more lax in
<br />
their database revisions,' he thought as he slowly paced his
<br />
trail to the intended target.  'However, I did have the
<br />
opportunity to inquire him about the required hardware for the
<br />
replicator.  Yet, I did not.  Possibility:  am I becoming more
<br />
and more prone to the effects of the past month?'  The answer
<br />
was, unfortunately, yes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After arriving at the workshop, his sensors penetrated the
<br />
metallic mass that comprised the bulk composition of the hut.  A
<br />
lone walrus was present, about five meters from David's
<br />
location.  David announced his presence by knocking on the main
<br />
door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The walrus came to the doorway and displaced the metal sheet
<br />
that barricaded the exterior environment from entry.  &quot;Well,
<br />
David,&quot; he said to his comrade, in awe of the situation, &quot;what a
<br />
pleasant surprise.  Come right in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, Rotor,&quot; the vulpine replied after he entered the
<br />
make-shift technological center.  He then continued in a less
<br />
formal and more jovial tone, &quot;It's pleasurable to have the
<br />
knowledge that I am still capable of coming here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor was a testimony to stress potentials and IR radiation.
<br />
&quot;Oh, David,&quot; the blue walrus responded, not completely in the
<br />
mindset to be cavorting.  &quot;I want you to know that you're always
<br />
welcome here.  We've missed you in the past month.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His dynamic interpreters were not required to give David what
<br />
information he needed about Rotor's tone waveform.  Deciding to
<br />
bypass the more social preliminaries, he opted for a more severe
<br />
vocal resonance, implying the true nature of his presence.
<br />
&quot;Excellent.  Rotor, I require your assistance on obtaining data
<br />
for the-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interruption from the walrus, who audibly slapped his right paw
<br />
on his face.  &quot;Oh, man!  I forgot to tell you yesterday during
<br />
the food supply run!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Insured that he and his associate were thinking of an identical
<br />
subject, he resumed, &quot;We are both at fault.  I had an equal
<br />
opportunity to discuss the replicator replacement part
<br />
requirements.&quot;  Admission of fallibility in this particular case
<br />
he felt was the most sensible action to take.  Not intending to
<br />
dwell on the subject, he persisted in his diatribe, &quot;Now that I
<br />
have the time to do so, what hardware is needed?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor then began naming the hardware components, while David
<br />
annotated them in his database for future retrieval.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy and David met each other at the bridge at about 0955
<br />
hours.  David began explaining the nature of the mission to
<br />
Dulcy while assisting her in putting on her ruck sack, but was
<br />
interrupted by the sound of Tails' voice bellowing at them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;David!  Dulcy!  Wait for me!&quot; as he traversed the distance
<br />
between Knothole Center and the bridge by flight.  He reached
<br />
his destination four seconds later, panting from the strain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi, Tails,&quot; greeted the dragon to the breath-depleted fox.
<br />
Tails could only wave back in acknowledgment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David, however, was not so amicable to his relative's arrival.
<br />
He stated in a perplexed tone, &quot;Tails, it's pleasing to see you
<br />
here, but it's not necessary.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I want to go too, David.  I don't care what Sonic and everyone
<br />
else thinks,&quot; the red vulpine explained after his lungs regained
<br />
the required amount of air to facilitate normal breathing and
<br />
speech.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well-meaning of you, Tails, however...&quot;  He broke off his
<br />
explanation, turning his head toward their female companion.
<br />
&quot;Dulcy,&quot; he asked, &quot;will you please excuse us for a few minutes?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; answered the dragon, baffled by David's treatment of
<br />
the situation.  She watched her two comrades walk off to a
<br />
secluded area in the Great Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;David, what's up?&quot; Tails asked when he saw that David was
<br />
satisfied with the general security of the location.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep breath from his brother;  not a favorable indication of
<br />
what he would say.  &quot;Tails,&quot; he began, &quot;I know that you have
<br />
been waiting to go with Dulcy for some time, especially since
<br />
you were the first-party observer to what Sonic thought of the
<br />
idea.  However, I would not recommend it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why can't I go?&quot; queried the other, saddened and irritated at
<br />
the suggestion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have a mission to perform,&quot; David continued, &quot;but more than
<br />
that, I have a promise to keep to Dulcy.  She agreed to go on
<br />
this mission with me as a surveyor, while I am responsible for
<br />
assisting her in landing properly.  Having someone else present
<br />
might only serve to aggravate an already precarious atmosphere
<br />
for her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; Tails returned in realization, &quot;I see.  Is there anything
<br />
I can do to help?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I need someone to monitor the transponder beacon signal.  If
<br />
anything unexpected occurs, it's necessary for someone to know
<br />
IMMEDIATELY.  And I nominate you for that position.&quot;  The black
<br />
and gray vulpine waited as his counterpart considered the
<br />
significance of the statement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, David, I'll make sure that you and Dulcy don't cause any
<br />
trouble,&quot; Tails finally retorted jovially.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Moi?&quot; David retorted back in mock innocence.  &quot;Cause trouble?
<br />
What evidence do you have of that proposed history?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails could only chuckle as he flew off toward their hut.
<br />
David regarded his brother with a reverent awe, having the
<br />
knowledge that his brother would always try to do the most
<br />
sensible thing.  With the most immediate impedance resolved, he
<br />
exited from the personal conference area, on a course back
<br />
toward Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he returned to his original position beside Dulcy, his
<br />
friend asked, &quot;What was all that about, David?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I regret that I am unable to explain,&quot; he initiated with a
<br />
grin on his face, &quot;but what transpired falls under the premise
<br />
of Security Access Level 4 Alpha.  Access nullified, Dulcy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Missing the mark on the intended target, she said, &quot;But I have
<br />
Level 4 clearance.  What's the big deal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; he conceded, &quot;you do have Level 4 access, but NOT the
<br />
Alpha Amendment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...&quot; the confounded dragon questioned, &quot;who can get the
<br />
Alpha Amendment?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Immediate family relatives of the Freedom Fighter Commander in
<br />
question,&quot; he rejoined, saying nothing further, indicating the
<br />
implied privacy he and Tails wished to maintain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy would not obtain any further information concerning the
<br />
confidential interaction between the two foxes.  Any further
<br />
questioning directed toward or around the subject would be
<br />
downloaded to one of David's null data cores.  In his own way,
<br />
David would effectively ignore interrogation.  Nothing was more
<br />
headstrong than an organic/computer system that had been
<br />
programmed (either by the manufacturers, or by itself in David's
<br />
case) to answer or not answer an input statement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She took the implication, and surrendered to it with
<br />
reluctance.  She then ventured the question relative to their
<br />
mission, &quot;So, where to?  My wings are itching to fly after being
<br />
stuck here with nowhere to go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No Alpha Amendment, nor a Level 4 restriction on that question.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;To the equator,&quot; the two-tailed vulpine returned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The equator?!&quot; the adolescent dragon nearly screeched.
<br />
&quot;David, do you have any idea how far it is from here to there?
<br />
And the heat, we're gonna melt!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No need to concern yourself, Dulcy,&quot; he reassured his
<br />
distressed comrade.  &quot;The purpose of our presence at the equator
<br />
is to enhance my ability to obtain data more uniformly across
<br />
the planet.  The process itself will take less than a minute to
<br />
perform.  I will personally be responsible for the flights.
<br />
They will consist of low-impulse propulsion velocities and warp
<br />
engagements.&quot;  He picked up her ruck sack from the ground, threw
<br />
it over her back, and expertly secured it to her torso.  &quot;What
<br />
YOU are required to execute are the LANDINGS.  They will be
<br />
under real-time conditions, relative to your organic timebase.
<br />
And they will be conducted at all of the suitable sites that I
<br />
locate.  I project that you may receive a high degree of
<br />
instruction today, so I believe the proper phrase is, 'keep your
<br />
wits about you'.  Any questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No return from Dulcy as she pondered over the mission plans.
<br />
She scratched the underside of her muzzle, thinking about the
<br />
possible important items that would make a difference between
<br />
the success and failure of the undertaking at hand.  She found
<br />
nothing lacking in them, since everything had been emphasized
<br />
over the course of the past day and now.  As always, David had
<br />
explained everything she needed to know.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well, then,&quot; he resumed, noticing that Dulcy had nothing
<br />
further to add.  &quot;Our first flight will be a warp engagement to
<br />
the equator for the long-range sensor scans, and we will remain
<br />
in warp space until the download is complete.  We will then
<br />
investigate the favorable areas at a significantly closer range
<br />
after the data has completed compilation.&quot;  His eyes changed to
<br />
a dark blue as a sensor probe emitted from them, looking up and
<br />
down the dragon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that?&quot; she asked, remotely concerned about the
<br />
unpleasant memories of SWATBot targeting sensors resurfacing in
<br />
her mind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A mass/volume determinator,&quot; he replied, resolving the
<br />
computer image of the required graviton warp field geometry in
<br />
his warp control computers.  Seeing the puzzled look on her
<br />
face, his dynamic interpreter suggested a response to the
<br />
implied question.  He informed, &quot;I'll speak to you in detail
<br />
about the theories behind graviton warp physics and everything
<br />
else involved with my system operations at a later and more
<br />
auspicious time.  Right now, we have other labors to complete.&quot;
<br />
He rotated his rotor/nacelles, and levitated to a midair
<br />
position three meters from the ground.  &quot;Dulcy,&quot; he instructed
<br />
his associate, &quot;follow me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon complied with the order, slowly rising from ground
<br />
level to a position approximately a meter from David.  She moved
<br />
around a few times, attempting to locate herself at the required
<br />
point in space where the warp field could easily envelop her
<br />
without being critically distorted by an aphasic lobe.  After
<br />
she found it, David signaled to her to remain as stable as
<br />
possible while he removed the protective shield partitions from
<br />
his sensitive graviton field discharge sections on his tails.
<br />
He gradually increased the warp field strength, phasing them out
<br />
of the known physical universe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;David,&quot; Dulcy inquired, &quot;how many times have you done this?&quot;
<br />
She was concerned that they would both be trapped in warp space
<br />
for eternity, if the procedure did not succeed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The response from her comrade didn't exactly heighten her
<br />
confidence.  &quot;Aside from the simulations in the restructure of
<br />
the dynamic graviton warp drive field,&quot; David began, &quot;this is my
<br />
first attempt.&quot;  What made the situation more ill-omened was
<br />
that, despite all of David's simulation experience, he didn't
<br />
seem very confident in the favorable outcome of the experiment
<br />
either.  One-billionth of a degree of critical distortion
<br />
outside of the field's reshaping abilities, or a slightly
<br />
miscalculated use of power, would be fatal to both of them.  All
<br />
the more incentive for David to investigate any and all factors
<br />
of concern in the new potential travel method.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Oh, boy,' Dulcy thought with resignation.  A new fear of
<br />
traveling via FTL threatened to engulf her spirit and her belief
<br />
in her comrade's abilities.  She regarded the brightening blue
<br />
light emission from David's still-rotating tails.  A sudden stop
<br />
to the rotor/nacelles' rotation, then a bright blue flash
<br />
encompassed her field of vision as the acceleration into warp
<br />
space commenced.  Her eyes instinctively closed at the deafening
<br />
influx of visible light.  No time remained for retrospective
<br />
analysis for either partner in this real-time experiment;  only
<br />
the hope that the procedure would operate well was on their
<br />
minds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in their physical real-time universe, the only indication
<br />
of their departure was an intense blue flash that spanned many
<br />
kilometers through the Great Forest, and a 35 dB wind shear
<br />
noise from the stressed air impacting David's navigational
<br />
deflector, dampened only by the precision-geometry differential
<br />
graviton fields.  They no longer existed in that point of space
<br />
on Mobius.
