Tails Miniseries#1 [Dec 1995]
<br />
&quot;Southern Crossover&quot; -- Part 1
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who's that amusing himself with preadolescent delusions of
<br />
grandeur?  It's Tails, depicting himself as a comic book hero
<br />
[artwork by Gallagher] while continuing to nurse a grudge against
<br />
the older freedom fighters, and coming off more and more like an
<br />
obnoxious little ingrate (sorry, but his character's getting
<br />
REALLY disagreeable here!).  After some exposition for anyone who
<br />
missed &quot;Growing Pains&quot; Sally shows up; Tails hides his comic art
<br />
as well as the documentation that was the set-up for this
<br />
miniseries.  Sally tries to make Tails understand why the Sea Fox
<br />
wasn't filled with oil; Tails, still resentful, casts off at the
<br />
first opportunity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Robotnik prepares his blimp to head for Southern
<br />
Mobius to supply his robo-underboss, Crocbot (I think Sonic would
<br />
appreciate the use of the word &quot;blimp&quot; in the same sentence as
<br />
&quot;Robotnik&quot; but anyway....).  We're made aware that Crocbot has
<br />
every intention of eventually overthrowing Robotnik and taking
<br />
over the whole shooting match himself, with the aid of his Wing
<br />
Dingoes (impressive bots, stupid name!).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails, while out on the open sea, notices a shadow being
<br />
cast on the water by nothing -- it's the blimp, which has been
<br />
cloaked except for the underside; since the course of the blimp
<br />
would have taken it over the open seas, who knew?  Tails flies in
<br />
for a closer look but is zapped by two SWATbots.  He comes to
<br />
before hitting the water and created two water spouts to sink the
<br />
SWATbots.  When he tries to reboard the Sea Fox, who should be
<br />
waiting for him but the octobot from &quot;Submersible Rehearsal&quot;
<br />
[Triple Trouble special].  It trashes the Sea Fox and pulls Tails
<br />
underwater.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails comes to and discovers that though he was on the verge
<br />
of drowning he was rescued by several underwater freedom
<br />
fighters: Bottlenose, a dolphin; Ray, a manta; P.B., a jellyfish
<br />
X-P; an unnamed giant clam; and Fluke, a blue whale.  With the
<br />
Sea Fox totalled, Fluke gives Tails a ride to Doununda.  To be
<br />
continued.
<br />
De-Tails (letters): Most noteworthy item was a response to a
<br />
question about Tails' parents: &quot;You'll eventually find...out
<br />
[about Tails' parents] in Sonic's comic book.&quot;  It appears that a
<br />
Tails origin and/or reunion story is in the works.  
<br />
