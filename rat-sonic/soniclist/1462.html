Robert Haynie &lt;rhaynie_at_jaguar.ac.edu&gt;:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; I seem to remember while gophering the usenet that somepne
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; poineted out something I've also noticed.. To wit-- In the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; SatSonic, Bunnie Rabbot has a robot arm and legs, but her...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; um... &quot;naughty bits&quot;, in Pythonesque terms, are apparently flesh
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; (she wears a leotard to cover those as well).  But in the comic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1"> &gt; Bunnie is apparently robot from teh waist down.  [...]
</em><br />
<br />That subject line reminds me I've always wanted to start up a really
<br />
okatu-tangential-useless-futile discussion about Bunnie's bio-cybernetic
<br />
systems.  Feel free to hit `n' if you can't stand wild speculations
<br />
from someone who sits at a console all day. :)
<br />
<br />...
<br />
<br />With so much of her physiology being replaced (the bone marrow in
<br />
the legs produce nearly all the body's blood cells, for example),
<br />
the bionics would certainly be involved to some [major] degree with
<br />
supporting her organic systems..  A rather impressive feat,
<br />
considering that they're continuing to function successfully on an
<br />
unanticipated case (ie: half-robotised); this shows a substantial
<br />
amount of intelligence on behalf of the maintenance nanites (or
<br />
whatever).
<br />
<br />If she has an intelligent cybernetically augmented immune&amp;etc
<br />
system, has her healing rate and other bodily production and
<br />
replacement functions improved or depreciated?  Is she effectively
<br />
immortal now?  (Insert a thousand story ideas here. :)
<br />
<br />Do the limbs have their own power supply (feel free to guess wildly
<br />
what it could be) or do they draw power from the organics?  If the
<br />
limbs do have their own source of energy, can this be used to
<br />
replenish organic energy systems like the ATP/ADP cycle? (Rather
<br />
simple to do, if the nanites can handle the endocrines) ...so does
<br />
Bunnie need to eat?  (What /does/ she eat? :) How are wastes taken
<br />
care of? (Absorption by the nans, I'd think.  How else here has read
<br />
&quot;Blood Music&quot;, by Greg Bear? :)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the loads she's placed on it, I would say that her skeleton
</em><br />
(at least the spine, collar bones and hips) is probably all
<br />
synthetic now.  It would be most interesting to see an X-Ray of
<br />
her...  (Is she just like a Terminator with only a skin-deep cute
<br />
and fluffy exterior? :)
