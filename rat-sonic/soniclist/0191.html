<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Has Metal/RoboSonic made an appearance in any of the cartoons or comics?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If so, in what incarnation: the giant gray behemoth of Sonic 2, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; skeletal Sonic of Sonic CD, or the value-size Terminator ripoff of S&amp;K?

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Inquiring minds want to know.  (:3

<br />
There was a Sonic robot in issue #9 of the Sonic comic from Archie. I
<br />
couldn't get this issue, so I don't know any details.
<br />

<br />
The Metal Sonic from the 'Sonic CD' game had an appearance in the Sonic
<br />
comic from Fleetway Publications, issue #21 - #23, 'The Sonic Terminator'
<br />
(last three parts of a six-part story).
<br />

<br />
Basically, the story has a lot of the CD game in it.
<br />

<br />
[snip]
<br />

<br />
Issue #21:
<br />
Sonic receives a distress signal sent by Amy (a pink lady hedgehog) from
<br />
Never Lake. When Sonic gets there he finds the Little Planet completely
<br />
covered with Robotniks factories and chained to Mobius with a gigantic
<br />
chain. While saving Amy he is attacked by Metal Sonic but is able to defeat
<br />
him. Just when things seem to be back to normal and Sonic does his usual
<br />
jokes (Sonic: &quot;Did I ever tell you that pink is my most _non-favourite_
<br />
color?&quot; Amy: &quot;Oh Sonic, you say the cutest things!&quot;) Metal Sonic gets up
<br />
again and hits Sonic from behind. Because its systems are severly damaged,
<br />
Metal Sonic takes Amy to the Little Planet as 'life bait' for Sonic. Sonic
<br />
follows them over the chain that holds the Little Planet.
<br />

<br />
Issue #22:
<br />
Sonic finds Amy and tries to defeat Metal Sonic, but his enemy is itself
<br />
a part of the technology that covers the Little Planet. So it can drain
<br />
energy from the surrounding machinery to repair itself. Just as Metal
<br />
Sonic is about to finish Sonic, it gets hit by another Sonic who is only
<br />
half the size of the original. He then pushes Sonic into a shrinking ray
<br />
and hands him a Time Stone.
<br />

<br />
Issue #23:
<br />
With the Time Stone Sonic travels back into the past and finds the machine
<br />
that caused the changes on the Little Planet. Because of his small size
<br />
he is able to enter the machine and destroy it from within. He travels
<br />
back to the present just in time to prevent Metal Sonic from doing the  
<br />
kill. He hands over the Time Stone to his other self and sends him back  
<br />
into time. Due to the changes in the past the Little Planet is returned to
<br />
normal. The Metal Sonic disappears too, because he was created by the same
<br />
machinery.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Another example for my bad grammar... oh well. Hope you can find out
<br />
what was meant.
<br />

<br />
Well, I don't know the story in issue #9 of the American Sonic comic,
<br />
but thinking of all the sh*t I've seen from Archie so far with all the
<br />
slapstick and uninspired drawing styles, I assume that the English
<br />
version is a little more interesting. (Too bad you haven't seen the
<br />
'Enter Knuckles' story from Fleetway. Definitely _way_ better than the
<br />
Archie comics version 'This Island Hedgehog'.)
<br />

<br />
Only my opinion... don't flame me, I'm nobody's toast.
<br />

<br />
