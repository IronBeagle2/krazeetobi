&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
<br />

<br />
[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />

<br />
Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
<br />
original four-part Sonic miniseries:
<br />

<br />
Issue 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't Cry For Me, Mobius&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
<br />
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
<br />
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
<br />
referred to as &quot;Boomer.&quot;)  Antoine then announces that there is a
<br />
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
<br />
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
<br />
ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Royal Family of Mobius&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
<br />
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
<br />
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
<br />
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
<br />
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.
<br />

<br />
Issue 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Run, Sally, Run&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
<br />
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
<br />
and almost throws her into the &quot;Robo-machine.&quot;  Sonic rescues
<br />
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
<br />
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
<br />
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.
<br />

<br />
Issue 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Crowning Achievement&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally decides to wear the &quot;Crown of the Acorn Kings&quot; which
<br />
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
<br />
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
<br />
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
<br />
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
<br />
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Issue 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Flashback&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
<br />
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
<br />
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
<br />
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
<br />
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Ask Spy&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
<br />
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
<br />
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
<br />
destroys the factory.
<br />

And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
<br />
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:

#1  [Aug 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
<br />
called &quot;Krudzu&quot; and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
<br />
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
<br />
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
<br />
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
<br />
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You Bet My Life!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher &amp; Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
<br />
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
<br />
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
<br />
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
<br />
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
<br />
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
<br />
casino was rebuilt for &quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot; (#16); the
<br />
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
<br />
the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
<br />
called &quot;Boomer&quot; at this time.  DJD]
<br />

<br />
#2  [Sep 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Triple Trouble&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
<br />
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
<br />
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
<br />
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
<br />
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vertigo A Go Go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
<br />
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All The Mail's About Tails&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
<br />
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
<br />
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
<br />
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
<br />
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
<br />
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
<br />
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
<br />
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
<br />
something dealing with evolution.
<br />

<br />
#3  [Oct 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Bomb Bugs Me&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has &quot;the
<br />
bomb.&quot;  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
<br />
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
<br />
to trick Crabmeat into giving &quot;the bomb&quot; to the freedom fighters,
<br />
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
<br />
Boomer suit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
<br />
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
<br />
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
<br />
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
<br />
they are &quot;tied up.&quot;  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
<br />
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
<br />
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
<br />
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
<br />
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
<br />
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
<br />
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
<br />
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
<br />
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
<br />
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
<br />
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
<br />
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
<br />
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
<br />
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
<br />
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]
<br />

<br />
#4  [Nov 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Lizard of Odd!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
<br />
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
<br />
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
<br />
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
<br />
&quot;Lizard Lips&quot; belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
<br />
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
<br />
roboticizer [see above, &quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;], and cuts
<br />
Universalamander down to size.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Little Tale&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
<br />
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
<br />
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
<br />
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
<br />
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
<br />
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
<br />
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#5  [Dec 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Olympic Trials and Errors&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
<br />
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik &quot;promises&quot;
<br />
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
<br />
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
<br />
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
<br />
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
<br />
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
<br />
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
<br />
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
<br />
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
<br />
repeated in &quot;That's The Spirit&quot; (#20). DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chomp on This, Chump!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
<br />
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
<br />
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
<br />
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
<br />
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
<br />
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
<br />
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
<br />
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
<br />
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in &quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
<br />
Fighter&quot; (#23). DJD]
<br />

<br />
#6  [Jan 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Spin Doctor&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
<br />
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
<br />
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
<br />
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
<br />
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
<br />
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
<br />
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
<br />
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
<br />
be rescued by Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic's Christmas Carol&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
<br />
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
<br />
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
<br />
straightened out. DJD]
<br />

<br />
#7  [Feb 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck's Treasure&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
<br />
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  They believe the &quot;treasure&quot; may be an invention that will
<br />
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
<br />
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
<br />
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
<br />
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
<br />
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
<br />
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
<br />
that the &quot;treasure&quot; is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
<br />
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorceress in Distress&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
<br />
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
<br />
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
<br />
to be real.  Robotnik sees the &quot;sorceress&quot; and, unaware that it's
<br />
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
<br />
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
<br />
sorceress's &quot;magic&quot; and Sally obliges, with a little help from
<br />
Sonic.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#8  [Mar 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bot's All, Folks!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
<br />
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
<br />
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, &quot;Botman,&quot; &quot;Wolvurkel&quot; (a
<br />
factory second sent by mistake), &quot;Spawnmower,&quot; &quot;Magbot--Freedom
<br />
Fighter Fighter,&quot; &quot;Captain Marbot&quot; and &quot;Mighty 'Bot.&quot;  [Furries
<br />
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  &quot;Wolvurkel&quot;
<br />
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
<br />
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Little Music Goes A Long Way&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
<br />
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
<br />
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
<br />
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
<br />
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
<br />
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
<br />
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
<br />
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
<br />
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
<br />
the hall.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#9  [Apr 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pseudo-Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
<br />
builds his ultimate eil robot, &quot;Pseudo-Sonic.&quot;  Meanwhile, Sonic
<br />
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
<br />
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
<br />
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
<br />
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
<br />
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
<br />
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
<br />
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the Point?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
<br />
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
<br />
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
<br />
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
<br />
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
<br />
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
<br />
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
<br />
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
<br />
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
<br />
say, was behind the mechanical trees).
<br />

#10  [May 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Revenge of the Nerbs!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
<br />
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
<br />
&quot;Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society&quot; can apprehend them, the
<br />
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
<br />
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
<br />
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
<br />
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
<br />
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
<br />
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
<br />
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
<br />
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
<br />
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
<br />
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
<br />
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
<br />
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Twan With The Wind&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
<br />
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
<br />
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
<br />
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
<br />
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
<br />
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
<br />
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a &quot;short cut&quot; via the Cosmic
<br />
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
<br />
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
<br />
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
<br />
Antisonic (c.f., &quot;When Hedgehogs Collide,&quot; #24) and the
<br />
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
<br />
Robotnik.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
<br />
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
<br />
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
<br />
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
<br />
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
<br />
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
<br />
Sonic wakes up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Timely Arrival&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
<br />
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
<br />
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
<br />
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
<br />
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
<br />
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
<br />
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
<br />
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
<br />
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
<br />
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
<br />
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
<br />
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
<br />
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
<br />
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
<br />
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
<br />
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
<br />
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
<br />
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
<br />
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
<br />
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
<br />
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
<br />
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
<br />
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
<br />
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
<br />
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
<br />
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
<br />
Sonic recovers the Emerald.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
<br />
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
<br />
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
<br />
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
<br />
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
<br />
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
<br />
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
<br />
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
<br />
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
<br />
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
<br />
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
<br />
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
<br />
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
<br />
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rockin' The Bot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
<br />
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
<br />
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
<br />
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
<br />
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
<br />
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
<br />
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
<br />
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
<br />
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
<br />
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
<br />
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
<br />
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
<br />
crafts a giant flyswatter.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
<br />
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
<br />
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
<br />
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
<br />
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
<br />
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
<br />
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
<br />
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
<br />
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Summary by Erich Schulman]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Under Glass&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
<br />
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
<br />
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
<br />
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
<br />
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
<br />
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
<br />
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
<br />
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
<br />
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
<br />
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
<br />
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
<br />
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
<br />
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
<br />
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
<br />
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
<br />
spin, he lands on &quot;undersea bank heist.&quot;  Robotnik's lackey's
<br />
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
<br />
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
<br />
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
<br />
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
<br />
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
<br />
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
<br />
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
<br />
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
<br />
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. &quot;The Mail's About
<br />
Tails&quot; (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
<br />
from the roboticizer (&quot;Rabbit Deployment,&quot; #3).  On a more
<br />
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
<br />
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
<br />
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
<br />
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
<br />
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
<br />
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
<br />
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
<br />
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
<br />
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
<br />
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
<br />
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.

While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.

#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
<br />
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): &quot;Give Mobius
<br />
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. [&quot;exceptionally versatile
<br />
evolvoid&quot;] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
<br />
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
<br />
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
<br />
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
<br />
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
<br />
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
<br />
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
<br />
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
<br />
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
<br />
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
<br />
tease--stay tuned.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
<br />
far and describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is
<br />
renouned for his military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
<br />
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally &amp; Geoffrey
<br />
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
<br />
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
<br />
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
<br />
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
<br />
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
<br />
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
<br />
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
<br />
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
<br />
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
<br />
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
<br />
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
<br />
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
<br />
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
<br />
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
<br />
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also some fan art: two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie (both NBD),
<br />
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Return&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penders/Spaziante &amp; Harvey M.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story opens with Sonic &amp; Sally MCW (Married with
<br />
Children; cf. the end of &quot;Sally's Quest&quot; in _In Your Face #1_). 
<br />
Sonic &amp; Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
<br />
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
<br />
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
<br />
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
<br />
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from &quot;Night of a Thousand
<br />
Sonics,&quot; (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
<br />
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter &quot;R-R&quot;) remains resident.  Robotnik
<br />
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
<br />
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
<br />
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
<br />
deactivates &quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; himself to keep from being
<br />
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
<br />
&quot;You owe me!&quot;  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
<br />
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
<br />
Spaziante artwork.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails Knighttime Story,&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak &amp; John Dagostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Tails grumps about &quot;get[ting] baby-sat&quot; while Sonic has
<br />
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
<br />
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who &quot;borrows&quot;
<br />
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
<br />
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
<br />
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
<br />
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: &quot;Keep
<br />
reading.&quot;  Translation: &quot;we're working on it!&quot;).  The cover of
<br />
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
<br />
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
<br />
&quot;creative differences&quot; theory in Q7.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;: Part 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
<br />
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
<br />
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
<br />
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
<br />
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
<br />
volunteers to stay with him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
<br />
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
<br />
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
<br />
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
<br />
opposed).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
<br />
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
<br />
Sally to Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
<br />
Sally marry? &quot;Could be.&quot;  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
<br />
forthcoming 48-page S&amp;K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
<br />
if so what does she look like? &quot;Of course...her origin may yet be
<br />
told.&quot;  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in &quot;Bloodlines&quot;
<br />
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all

captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
<br />
order to save Robotnik from &quot;disposal,&quot; Sonic convinces Car-Heem
<br />
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
<br />
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape

Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species, Part III&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
(Summary: James Firmiss)
<br />
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
<br />
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
<br />
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
<br />
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
<br />
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
<br />
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
<br />
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
<br />
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
<br />
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
<br />
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
<br />
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
<br />
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
<br />
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
<br />
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
<br />
the chamber blows up because a &quot;feedback loop&quot; has occurred. 
<br />
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
<br />
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
<br />
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
<br />
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
<br />
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
<br />
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
<br />
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
<br />
&quot;moles&quot;.  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
<br />
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
<br />
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
<br />
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
<br />
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
<br />
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
<br />
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
<br />
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
<br />
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
<br />
serious lip-locking before they part.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
<br />
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
<br />
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
<br />
leader of the &quot;Rebel Underground&quot; and acted as a double agent in
<br />
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
<br />
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
<br />
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
<br />
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
<br />
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
<br />
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
<br />
was an automated Sally:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the real Sally always called him &quot;Mr. St. John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
<br />
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
<br />
replaced by a robot double.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
<br />
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
<br />
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
<br />
unexpected happened.
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
<br />
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats....&quot;  JF

#24  [Jul 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When Hedgehogs Collide&quot; (in 4 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich
<br />
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
<br />
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
<br />
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from &quot;The Good, The
<br />
Bad and the Hedgehog&quot; [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
<br />
&quot;the Antisonic,&quot; as in &quot;the Antichrist&quot;) is looking for some
<br />
action, so he rounds up the &quot;gang&quot; consisting of the Antisally,
<br />
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
<br />
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
<br />
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
<br />
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot; though they were unable to penetrate &quot;the Zone
<br />
of Silence&quot; (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
<br />
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
<br />
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
<br />
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
<br />
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
<br />
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
<br />
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
<br />
strategies.  So it's &quot;Change partners!&quot; as play is resumed: Sonic
<br />
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
<br />
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
<br />
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
<br />
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
<br />
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
<br />
peacefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
<br />
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
<br />
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
<br />
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
<br />
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
<br />
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
<br />
the work and &quot;kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!&quot;  At least,
<br />
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
<br />
to...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a &quot;Sonic + Bunnie&quot; graffiti
<br />
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sally,&quot; &quot;Sonic + Nicole&quot;--THAT I'd like to see!--and &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sonic&quot;], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
<br />
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
<br />
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
<br />
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
<br />
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
<br />
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
<br />
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGram: information on two upcoming &quot;special&quot; issues: the
<br />
48-page Sonic &amp; Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
<br />
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
<br />
the &quot;Silver Anniversary&quot; issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
<br />
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of &quot;Do-It-
<br />
Yourself Sonic Contest&quot; winners who have moved and left no
<br />
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
<br />
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
<br />
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Panic in the Sky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobians living on the western shore of &quot;the Great
<br />
Continent&quot; [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
<br />
another adjective besides &quot;Great&quot;: viz.: the Great Forest, the
<br />
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the &quot;all-purpose&quot;
<br />
use of the word _hrair_, or &quot;thousands&quot; by rabbits in Richard
<br />
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
<br />
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
<br />
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
<br />
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
<br />
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
<br />
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
<br />
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
<br />
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
<br />
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
<br />
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
<br />
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
<br />
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
<br />
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
<br />
It appears that Robotnik is &quot;hijacking&quot; the island by somehow
<br />
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
<br />
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
<br />
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
<br />
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
<br />
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
<br />
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
<br />
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
<br />
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
<br />
replaces the &quot;real&quot; Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
<br />
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
<br />
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
<br />
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
<br />
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fire Drill&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penders/Art: Jon D'Agostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
<br />
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
<br />
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
<br />
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
<br />
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
<br />
island.  Must be Nack the Weasel -- check out the SonicGram in
<br />
issue #23 for a hint.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord of the Floating Island&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penders/Harvey Mercadoocasio
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
<br />
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
<br />
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
<br />
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
<br />
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
<br />
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
<br />
Knuckles' exit line: &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect
<br />
and serve!&quot;  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
<br />
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
<br />
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
<br />
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
<br />
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
<br />
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
<br />
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
<br />
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
<br />
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.
<br />

<br />
#25  [Aug 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go Ahead...Mecha My Day&quot; (the only story in this issue)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
based on summary by James Firmiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
<br />
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a &quot;zone portal.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
<br />
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
<br />
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
<br />
terms: &quot;Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice.&quot;
<br />
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
<br />
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
<br />
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
<br />
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
<br />
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
<br />
much of a bustline in issue #21!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
<br />
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
<br />
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#26 [Sep 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way, Way Past Cool&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
<br />
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
<br />
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
<br />
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
<br />
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
<br />
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
<br />
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
<br />
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
<br />
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
<br />
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
<br />
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
<br />
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has inspired renewed argument over species
<br />
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
<br />
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
<br />
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
<br />
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
<br />
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
<br />
expect?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
<br />
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
<br />
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
<br />
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
<br />
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
<br />
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
<br />
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
<br />
would ordinarily avoid water?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan art
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fortified&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
<br />
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
<br />
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
<br />
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
<br />
forge.  Robotnik's &quot;bus&quot; crashes into the fort, only to confront
<br />
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
<br />
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
<br />
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
<br />
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in &quot;Vol-Ant-eer&quot; in Sonic #23
<br />
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
<br />
her a little on the &quot;squashed&quot; side.  After Spaziante's rendering
<br />
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
<br />
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
<br />
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
<br />
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
<br />
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
<br />
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
<br />
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of &quot;total destruction&quot; don't
<br />
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
<br />
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
<br />
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
<br />
Trouble special.

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
<br />
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
<br />
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
<br />
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
<br />
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
<br />
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
<br />
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
<br />
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
<br />
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
<br />
address is princess_at_frdmftrs.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
<br />
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
<br />
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
<br />
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot;
<br />
description:
<br />

<br />
Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
<br />
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
<br />
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
<br />
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
<br />
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
<br />
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
<br />
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
<br />
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
<br />
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
<br />
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
<br />
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
<br />
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
<br />
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
<br />
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
<br />
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: &quot;Eight years
<br />
passed.&quot;  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
<br />
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
<br />
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
<br />
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chuck&quot; and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
<br />
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
<br />
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
<br />
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
<br />
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
<br />
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
<br />
encounters &quot;a cute little chipmunk girl&quot;: Princess Sally Acorn. 
<br />
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the &quot;Ro-Bo-Machine.&quot;  Ch. 7:
<br />
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
<br />
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
<br />
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
<br />
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
<br />
them to &quot;Knothole Village&quot; which is &quot;under the forest floor.&quot;
<br />
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
<br />
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
<br />
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
<br />
explanation in the comics (Sonic #3).  In addition, both Uncle
<br />
Chuck and Muttski in this book has been successfully
<br />
deroboticized (see above), which conflicts with &quot;Sonic
<br />
Conversion&quot; and, in fact, the rest of the second season.

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
<br />
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
<br />
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
<br />
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
<br />
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
<br />
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
<br />
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
<br />
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic &amp; Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
<br />
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
<br />
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
<br />
take out the bots and &quot;haul some serious haunch&quot; back to
<br />
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
<br />
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
<br />
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
<br />
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
<br />
question was one of &quot;brave and true warriors&quot; compiled by Sally's
<br />
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
<br />
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
<br />
fragment:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...beside your bed safe and...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...tucked in tight...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...you cannot fall...
<br />
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
<br />
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
<br />
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
<br />
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
<br />
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
<br />
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
<br />
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
<br />
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
<br />
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
<br />
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
<br />
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
<br />
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
<br />
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
<br />
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
<br />
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
<br />
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
<br />
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
<br />
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
<br />
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of &quot;clues&quot; is
<br />
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
<br />
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
<br />
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
<br />
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
<br />
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
<br />
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
<br />
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
<br />
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
<br />
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
<br />
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
<br />
&quot;bot&quot; were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
<br />
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
<br />
its &quot;prisoners&quot; arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
<br />
and the Freedom Fighters escape.
<br />

_Sonic the Hedgehog: Friend or Foe?_
<br />
PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode
<br />
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
<br />
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
<br />
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
<br />
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
<br />
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
<br />
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
<br />
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
<br />
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
<br />
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
<br />
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
<br />
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
<br />
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
<br />
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
<br />
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
<br />
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
<br />
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
<br />
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
<br />
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
<br />
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
<br />
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
<br />
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
<br />
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
<br />
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
<br />
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
<br />
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
<br />
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
<br />
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
<br />
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
<br />
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
<br />
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
<br />
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
<br />
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.
