<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stories, we may as well say Robotnik has succeeded.
</em><br />

<br />
Well, I'd say he, how yuo said, &quot;succeeded&quot;. His only problem is a small
<br />
group of people living dangerously too close to him (dangerous for him).
<br />
As for these people, all hope is not yet lost. Their families, friends, and
<br />
a lot of other people who got captured all over Mobius, are robotocized, and
<br />
are safe at the time. The derobotization project is on the way too.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Either 250 million is too high, or there must be other survivors 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;underground and on the Floating Island who we've not seen yet.
</em><br />

<br />
Didn't you say that there were 250 million people yourself?
<br />
I'm confused here.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; started taking over the farthest cities from Mobotropolis. This way, the
</em><br />
King
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; would have a less chance to find out what's happening. (The Great War?)
</em><br />
Then,
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; after taking over a closer city or location, Robotnik would destroy the
</em><br />
old
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; city, and all of it's inhabitants, thus avoiding the hastle of looking
</em><br />
over
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the prisioners. When Robotnik finaly got to Mobotropolis, the King didn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; suspect anything because there were no reports (all the inhabitants who
</em><br />
could
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; tell about it were dead with their cities). Thus, Robotnik managed to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; everybody by surprise, and once again, to avoid the hastle of prisioners
</em><br />
and
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; satisfy his hunger for violence, killed/roboticised the inhabitants. 
</em><br />

<br />
I like the overall line of reasoning, but what about residents of an 
<br />
undestroyed village who go visit a destroyed village (not knowing what 
<br />
had happened)?  Surely word would get back to the King, and I don't think 
<br />
he's foolish enough to not investigate such reports.  Or do we assume 
<br />
that inter-village travel is something they just didn't to very much of?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Ok, what about the SWAT-bots? They usually patroll these kind of places,
<br />
and, By looking at the coup, I'd say they are doing their job well.
<br />
In other words, anyone comes into Robotnik's city is in deep stool.
<br />
Also, if anyone asks: The roboticized people are mainly, if not only,
<br />
from Mobotropolis. Do you(plural) remember in Blast to the Past, the first 
<br />
roboticizer was tested on some dog, and then, Sir Charles was the first one
<br />
to 
<br />
be roboticized after the testing was complete?
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;about 50 to 100 are freedom fighters.
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If Mobius went from 250,000,000 to &lt;=1000 (that over -99.9995%), I think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'd be about ready to cry for them.:-(  And nothing could possibly be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adequate punishment for 'buttnik and Snively wiping out &gt;249.9 million 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;innocent Mobians.
</em><br />

<br />
There could be a couple of thousand mobians still alive. Not ALL of them
<br />
are freedom fighters. And not ALL of them were killed (some were
<br />
roboticized).
<br />
Also, if there are, say, fifty people in each group (af civilians/freedom-
<br />
fighters), that would make for about 20 FF groups (If there are 1000 people
<br />
in
<br />
their natural state). 2000 would make forty. And I think that 20 - 40 groups
<br />
would be a nice estimate.
<br />

<br />
BTW (or by the way. thaks) since Mobotropolis was the capital of the PLANET,
<br />
I would think that there would be quite a lot of people living in it (say
<br />
20 million?) and when you add all of the turists, guests, people with
<br />
business,
<br />
and people who just got lost, I think that the number of civilians (or robots
<br />
waitind to be deroboticized) would be quite high. (so stop crying, there
<br />
is quite a lot of hope for them yet)
