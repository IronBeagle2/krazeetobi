<br />
Part 5.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I tell you, I should have gone after him right then!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, we had to get out of there!  With those tankers coming in, 
<br />
there would not have been any hiding place at all!  There was no time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but...&quot;  Sonic had to finish his sentence with a fist to the 
<br />
wall.  He stood, shaking his head, and finally said, &quot;Well, what's to 
<br />
stop me from going after him, now?  I've got a power ring.  All I've got 
<br />
to do is bust him out of the prison block, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at Bookshire, who sat looking at his computer.  &quot;It 
<br />
doesn't look that way, Sonic,&quot; he said.  &quot;According to this, Tolouse has 
<br />
yet to be entered as a prisoner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire explained.  &quot;Robotnik has a system for keeping track of 
<br />
prisoners.  Whenever a 'rebel' is captured, he is taken to the prison 
<br />
block, informed that he has been tried for treason and found guilty, and 
<br />
then his name is entered into the computer.  Some time after that, he is 
<br />
roboticized and sent to work wherever Robotnik 'needs' him.  I'm looking 
<br />
at those records now.  Tolouse's name is nowhere to be seen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what does that mean?  He could still be in the prison block, 
<br />
right, and just not typed in?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally answered.  &quot;That is a possibility, but there is no way to 
<br />
guarantee that, and you would spend too much time looking for him.  For 
<br />
all we know he could have been,&quot; she swallowed, &quot;killed right after he 
<br />
called us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Or, he could still be alive hiding somewhere, right?!  I want to 
<br />
go look for him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, please, listen!&quot;  Sally tried to comfort him, but her voice 
<br />
was cracking as well.  &quot;The odds of him being alive and hiding are...not 
<br />
enough to justify this.  Right now there is nothing we can do.  But...&quot; 
<br />
and she turned to look at Bookshire, &quot;as soon as he finds out anything, 
<br />
we will go find him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Sally, but said nothing.  Soon after that, he 
<br />
walked slowly out of Bookshire's dwelling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire sighed and said quietly, &quot;Sally, I'll try everywhere.  It 
<br />
may take a while, but there are some other files I can try breaking into 
<br />
that might help...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally mouthed a quiet &quot;thank you&quot; and turned to follow Sonic.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some time earlier...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell paced around Tolouse slowly, calmly repeating his question 
<br />
one last time.  &quot;Now, I'll ask once more, and if you answer politely and 
<br />
honestly, there may be hope for you.  What were you doing near the 
<br />
coolant treatment plant?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse trembled with fear, and he knew that he didn't sound 
<br />
convincing, but he wasn't going to betray his friends.  &quot;J-j-just 
<br />
walking around.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell glared at him, a stare that bore deep into Tolouse and 
<br />
threatened to make him faint.  &quot;Very well, I guess I will have to---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell!  How is my favorite android today?  I hear we have a new 
<br />
prisoner!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell cursed silently, and turned to greet Robotnik.  &quot;Good day, 
<br />
sir.  I was conducting interrogation of this prisoner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, something that you are quite good at.  However, I have 
<br />
something else in mind today.  Take the prisoner to my personal 
<br />
transport.  I wish to...have a little talk with him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's basic emotions allowed him to experience surprise and 
<br />
utter disbelief.  &quot;Sir?  Perhaps you would be interested in---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not today, Packbell, not today.  I am in a rare good mood, and I 
<br />
intend to make the most of it.  And I think this prisoner can help me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse wasn't sure if he should feel relieved that he was getting 
<br />
away from Packbell or even more scared that Robotnik apparently had 
<br />
special plans for him.  He was numbly aware of the Swat-bots releasing 
<br />
him from the interrogation chair and leading him towards Robotnik's 
<br />
vehicle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell continued to regard Robotnik with shock.  &quot;Sir, may I ask 
<br />
what you have in mind?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sighed.  &quot;Just a little game I have had in my mind for 
<br />
quite some time that I wish to play.  Today is the perfect day for it.  
<br />
Well, good day, Commander.  Continue the superb work that you do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell had one last thought concerning Robotnik as he watched him 
<br />
leave:  &quot;That confounded fool is going to make one mistake too many, 
<br />
some day.  I will be there, waiting.&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very seldom that Dr. Ivo Robotnik was in a good mood.  Most 
<br />
of the time he was too busy planning some new way to add to the 
<br />
monoliths of Robotropolis, or he was finding something to destroy in 
<br />
frustration over a defeat at the hands of the Freedom Fighters.  Today, 
<br />
however, was different.  The factories that he had ordered rebuilt were 
<br />
now finished, a full three days earlier than scheduled, and now it 
<br />
appeared that some Freedom Fighter plan had been thwarted, for they had 
<br />
managed to capture one of them, and there had been no negative 
<br />
consequences.  Yes, today was truly a good day.  And when Robotnik was 
<br />
in a good mood, he had the potential to become more evil than even 
<br />
Packbell dared to hypothesize.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was quite fortunate, he thought to himself now, as he looked 
<br />
over the files that he had read and reread so much, that the prisoner 
<br />
was a fox.  This made the game that he was about to play that much more 
<br />
enjoyable.  &quot;Swat-bots, bring the prisoner in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was brought into the room, and ordered to take a seat next 
<br />
to Robotnik's workstation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, prisoner.  You know, I think we are going to get to 
<br />
know each other very well today, and I would prefer to have something 
<br />
else to call you.  What should that be?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked at him in fright, but didn't know what else he could 
<br />
say.  &quot;T-Tolouse,&quot; he stammered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse.  Pleased to have you in my company...if only for a short 
<br />
while.&quot;  Robotnik chuckled evilly.  Then, he looked at the text that 
<br />
filled the workstation's monitor.  &quot;Tolouse, how familiar are you with 
<br />
Mobian history?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I-I'm not...I...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh do not worry, I would not kill you simply for that.  Here.  
<br />
Allow me to enrich your mind.  Did you know that, according to most 
<br />
research, foxes were the first species on Mobius to evolve into sentient 
<br />
beings?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was too scared even to shake his head.  What was going on 
<br />
here?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik continued.  &quot;This, according to theory, occured nearly 3 
<br />
and a half million years ago.  I could go into the fascinating details 
<br />
that these files provide for each stage of evolution, but I do not see 
<br />
any need to fill your head with such useless information.  However, one 
<br />
could begin to think that this is possibly the reason why foxes are the 
<br />
most populous of all the species on this planet, don't you think?  
<br />
Perhaps this is also why one got to be king of all civilization...if 
<br />
only for a few short months.&quot;  Robotnik chuckled again, then continued 
<br />
with his lecture.  &quot;Now, what I will tell you next intrigues me even 
<br />
more.  This same research that says foxes were Mobius's first 
<br />
intellegent animals, also says that humans were the last.  Foxes became 
<br />
sentient 3 and a half million years ago, and humans only 2 million years 
<br />
ago.  Well, that does not seem the fairest thing in the world, now does 
<br />
it?  We poor humans seem to have gotten the short end of the 
<br />
evolutionary stick!  Perhaps that is why humans like me intend to...make 
<br />
up for it, hmm?&quot;  Robotnik laughed and looked at Tolouse, who by now sat 
<br />
still with a dazed expression on his face, continuing to prepare for the 
<br />
worst, and continuing to see the worst put off by events he could not 
<br />
begin to comprehend.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik was enjoying himself.  But, he thought to himself, the 
<br />
best is yet to come.  He typed in a command, and a new page of text 
<br />
appeared on the monitor.  &quot;Now, here is where it gets even more 
<br />
fascinating.  During that time when your ancestors were apparently 
<br />
intelligent, but mine were not, there was an interesting practice that 
<br />
many ancient foxes took part in.  It seems that when a group of foxes 
<br />
got together and decided they all wanted some excitement, they would 
<br />
find some poor unsuspecting animal, force it to run around while they 
<br />
chased it, and then finally corner and kill it.  This was known simply 
<br />
as, The Hunt.  And you know what?  More often than not, the animals they 
<br />
hunted like this were the direct ancestors of humans!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you can imagine how...unfair I thought all this was when I 
<br />
first read it.  Imagine, a gang of foxes attacking a single, defenseless 
<br />
human.  It makes me want to find some way to justify it all, to avenge 
<br />
those ancestors of mine who were wrongfully killed in this manner.  And 
<br />
so, Tolouse, with your help, I plan on doing just that.  You will 
<br />
represent your ancestors, and I will represent mine, in a new twist on 
<br />
the Hunt, which I shall call the Fox-Hunt.  You will be the hunted, and 
<br />
I will be the hunter.  Tell me, does this not sound like a great game to 
<br />
play, for not only does it pass the time, it also corrects the wrongs 
<br />
that out ancestors experienced so long ago.  And...&quot; Robotnik leaned 
<br />
forward and gave Tolouse a deep look that Packbell would have been 
<br />
impressed with.  &quot;I am sure that you find this much more appealing 
<br />
than...the roboticizer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik searched Tolouse's dazed face for a reaction, and finally 
<br />
got one.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse fainted dead away.
<br />

<br />
to be continued
