How about DULCY... I don't see much of her since she was first introduced.
<br />

<br />
Yes... Long ago I said I didn't care for Dulcy on the TV series due to
<br />
her annoying voice... Well, now that she's in a comic [and in fanfic 
<br />
stories], I can imagine her voice as not so annoying and I've gotten to 
<br />
like her much better.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No offense, (not YOU guys's fault, I blame Sega,) I HATE Antoine as a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; charachter.  I'd actually like to see LESS of him. ;)  (he's very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; annoying and doesn't provide that comic relief.  I think Rotor is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better comic releif, and he's usually not even funny!)  I'm partial to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails and Sally myself.  :)
</em><br />

<br />
I've thought Antoine's potential has been 'underused' at times... Some of
<br />
the last episodes of the Sat AM series were finally beginning to see his
<br />
potential (like when he was kidnapped and Snively tried to get info out of
<br />
him by torturing him with bad cooking) 
<br />

<br />
I know I can get that way when I see someone 'doing it wrong' while using
<br />
a word processor or other program which I'm familiar with.  &quot;Ahhh!  You're
<br />
trying to line things up with spaces when you should be using tabs!  Ahhh!  
<br />
Why aren't you using paragraph styles?  Ahhh!  Why are you adding all of
<br />
your misspelled words to the spelling directory?  (things I've had to deal
<br />
with in my office... Ahhhh!)&quot;
<br />

<br />
Dan Drazen said he's working on a story with Antoine being used in a 
<br />
positive way.  Long ago I said I couldn't think of any ideas for my
<br />
own Sonic stories... So far I have about 4 ideas floating around...
<br />
the most complete idea will have Antoine playing a very positive role
<br />
(it also presents my theory as to how power rings work).  [I think I've 
<br />
briefly described some of these ideas to someone on the list... Dan I 
<br />
think].
