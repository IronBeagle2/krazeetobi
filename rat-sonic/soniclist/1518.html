<br />
Hello there. I'm Joseph from FurToonia, and I've recently discovered this
<br />
mailing list.  I'm a rather large Sonic fan, so I was rather dismayed when
<br />
I finally realized ABC wasn't carryin StH anymore.  So...
<br />
<br />I wrote this message on the bulletin board on FurToonia.  I'm sending it,
<br />
in a slightly altered form, to this list in hopes of arousing your interest
<br />
in my plan.
<br />
<br />-- Message --
<br />
<br />As many of you may know, the SatAM Sonic the Hedgehog cartoon has been 
<br />
recently (ok, not THAT recently) cancelled.  While the first 2 seasons are
<br />
now floating around USA (praise USA!) Network, the demand for a 3rd season
<br />
(and the continuation of the series in general) has been rather high.
<br />
These are some of the reasons that come up repeatedly for reactivating the
<br />
show, and letting it have a 3rd season.  Your mileage may very.  
<br />
(In addition, please add your own, or improve the ones you see.)
<br />
<br />1.  The final episode.  If the last episode of Sonic the Hedgehog was not
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most extreme cliffhanger in the history of all Saturday morning
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cartoons, I'm not orange.  Even the SWAT Kats ended with a modicum 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of closure; all of THEIR bad guys were DEAD.  What of Snively, and the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mysterious eyes behind him?  What happened to Robotnik?  What about the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King?  (Talk about your cartoonus interruptus...) 
<br />
<br />2.  This was a *good* show.  It gave all SORTS of good messages.  It was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pro-environment (the good guys live in peace with nature, badniks
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destroy it), anti-pollution (ditto), and even had the good taste to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;have a hero who wasn't `dark and gritty' or `cute and cloying', but 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rather is/was a fun, sarcastic (but not cruel) young adult.  It wasn't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;overly violent, nor an (excessively) obvious merchandising gimmick.
<br />
<br />3.  It was also a &quot;good&quot; show in the respect that it was well-written and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animated.  Very rarely does such a quality show end up on ABC, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;especially during the SatAM merchandising-block.  It had drama.  Pathos.    
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was *funny* sometimes, too.  It was a show that anyone of any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age could watch and appreciate on some level.  
<br />
<br />4.  I only need to gesticulate toward Scratchwood's (<a href="http://rat.org/bookshire">http://rat.org/bookshire</a>) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Web page and the various other fandom pages to demonstrate the amount 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of Sonic fandom out and about on the net today.  And that's just what *I*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;know of on the Net, mind you.  There's probably a lot more out there I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't know about.  The comic book also has a large following.  And I'm
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sure these people would gladly buy any products that any sponsor of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show would produce, and recommend X product to their friends.
<br />
<br />Now, if you're interested in saving this show from the bit bucket, please
<br />
keep watching this board for more info.  Details as they become apparent.
<br />
<br />-- End --
<br />
<br />(Well, that's what I was able to come up with.)  
<br />
<br />Now, here's what I'm thinking here...basically, all we do are these 
<br />
three things:
<br />
<br />1.  The first thing we'd need to do is to write a message basically
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explaining to someone unknowledgeable on the subject what the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;show is, and the circumstances surrounding its cancellation.  Then, we
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain why we feel it is good (in a thesis-like form), so to convince 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iggy Internet (or whoever) to assist us in our cause.
<br />
<br />2.  Then, a letter should immediately follow the previous message that one
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could send to (our main enemy) Sega.  It would be pretty similar to   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the thesis about why the show is good; it would explain why we want
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sega to give permission back to DiC to make StH episodes, and our 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;willingness to fully support them if they do.  (If we need to write a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd letter, this will be slightly more threatening.)
<br />
<br />3.  Then, the important thing will be distributing the information to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;masses.  SirKain (sirkain_at_usa.pipeline.com) will spread it through 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his various BBS connections, and I'll send it all over Usenet's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;various animation and furry groups, and hit as many furry MU* bulletin
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boards as I possibly can.  (Please don't hesistate to do so yourself,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either.)  Every little bit helps, so we'd hope that you'd stick
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the info wherever you think it'd be cool, and tell all your friends 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to send in letters, too.
<br />
<br />Then, all we'd have to do is distribute and soapbox about the situation
<br />
until something gets done.  Make your whole family sign at the bottom.
<br />
Hell, go up and down the street with a petition.  The more names you get,
<br />
the better chance we've got of getting a 3rd season (or at least some sort
<br />
of closure episode) out of Sega.  
<br />
<br />So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
<br />
least make enough noise to make them notice us.  Send your replies to the
<br />
list.  
<br />
<br />Thanks,
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- That cyberpunk.
