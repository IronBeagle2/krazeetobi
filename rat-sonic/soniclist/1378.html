<br />
<br />Part 3
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time that Sonic and the others were returning to Knothole, sounds of
<br />
destruction could be heard within the Robotropolis Command Center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SNIVELY!&quot; Robotnik's voice boomed across the room.  &quot;TELL ME!&quot;  He grabbed
<br />
his nephew by the collar and picked him up to look at him face to face.  &quot;YOU 
<br />
TELL ME!  HOW COULD THEY HAVE DONE IT?!  HOW??!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of you! Snively wanted to shout at him.  You should have foreseen 
<br />
this and increased security at the plant the very day that freedom fighter was 
<br />
captured!  Don't whine to me about something that is completely your fault, 
<br />
*sir*!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But out loud, Snively only said, &quot;I am looking into it, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik held him there for a moment longer before finally releasing 
<br />
him...by tossing him into a nearby wall.  He turned to say something more, but 
<br />
then turned back around and sat in his command chair, tapping his fingers, 
<br />
leaving Snively to glare at his back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the entranceway, Packbell stood, watching all this.  Packbell always 
<br />
enjoyed tormenting Snively, and he would have been enjoying the abuse Robotnik 
<br />
was dealing Snively now, were it not for the circumstances.  Packbell had come 
<br />
to the same conclusion that Snively had:  The loss of the coolant treatment 
<br />
plant was the result of Robotnik's short-sightedness.  The fool had made yet 
<br />
another mistake, he thought.  Only this time, we're all paying for it.  He 
<br />
turned and walked away, making his way to his private quarters.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is time for a new plan of action.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late that night, Packbell sat at his workstation.  File after file appeared
<br />
on the screen as Packbell called them up, as if at random.  He wasn't really 
<br />
reading them, though.  His mind was elsewhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to stop the Freedom Fighters?  Too many times they have gotten away, he
<br />
thought, and though Robotnik's poor strategy has a lot to do with it, there's 
<br />
something about them that seems to give them the upper hand.  What?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell thought hard, working on theories.  It couldn't just be the desire
<br />
to overthrow Robotnik.  Packbell had easily dealt with such ambitious people in 
<br />
the past.  He didn't think it was just their talents, either.  Sure, things like
<br />
Sonic's speed, Sally's cunning, and Bunnie's strength were all important 
<br />
factors, but again, it wasn't anything that Packbell felt he couldn't handle.  
<br />
Then what was it?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's eyes focused on the screen, and he found himself looking at a 
<br />
file detailing one of Robotnik's excursions from a few months ago.  Robotnik had
<br />
succeeded in kidnapping Sally and Tails, but instead of dealing with them in a 
<br />
timely manner, he had simply held them in the hopes of trapping Sonic as well.  
<br />
Sonic had appeared, but only to succeed in rescuing them, not to be captured.  
<br />
Yet another example of Robotnik's superb planning, Packbell thought 
<br />
sarcastically.  The same could be said about what had happened recently.  
<br />
Robotnik's desire to &quot;play&quot; with the Freedom Fighter they had captured had only 
<br />
resulted in his being rescued by Sonic.  If only Robotnik wouldn't insist on 
<br />
putting off what needed to be done *when* it needed to be done...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, it hit him.  That's it!  That's what kept the Freedom Fighters 
<br />
going strong.  Comradery.  They were always there for each other.  Whenever one 
<br />
of them was in danger, the others always tried to help in any way possible, and 
<br />
usually (again thanks to Robotnik, he thought darkly) there was such a way.  
<br />
Now, how would they react if they couldn't pull off such a rescue?  Not just 
<br />
anybody of course, as Robotnik's forces had captured and roboticized Knothole 
<br />
citizens before, but one of the main group.  Yes, he thought, what would happen 
<br />
to their precious egos if they watched one of their own die, slowly, painfully, 
<br />
knowing there was absolutely nothing they could do to help?  An evil smile came 
<br />
to his face.  An excellent idea, he told himself.  Now, who should it be?  
<br />
Sonic?  No; although the lack of Sonic's speed would certainly hurt them, they 
<br />
would probably use his death as a reason to band together and fight that much 
<br />
harder.  Sally?  No, for the same reason.  His mind went over each name, 
<br />
dismissing them for one reason or another until finally he thought of:  Tails.  
<br />
Yes, Tails, the young fox who was always looking up to the Freedom Fighters.  To
<br />
see their young friend vanquished before their very eyes...  Packbell began to 
<br />
chuckle.  It was almost too perfect.  With Tails' death weighing on their minds,
<br />
he was certain their morale would be destroyed.  And soon after, so would they.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell typed in a set of commands, and the information that the computer 
<br />
had on Tails appeared on the screen, including a picture.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are my key,&quot; Packbell said to image on the screen, &quot;to disposing of 
<br />
the Freedom Fighters once and for all!&quot;
<br />
<br />To be continued.
