Sigh... that's it.  I've had enough.
<br />

<br />
We had a good thing going on here, but in my eyes, we blew it.  Several
<br />
times over.
<br />

<br />
When I first got into Sonic stuff, just over a year ago, we had a great
<br />
cartoon show, a decent comic book, some great fan-fic stories written by
<br />
a handful of authors, and a developing RP saga on FurToonia.
<br />

<br />
What do we have now?  The show is gone, the RPing is in, what, it's third
<br />
attempt now, and still coming apart at the seams?  And the fan-fic?  *sigh*
<br />
The fan-fic has a reputation that, in case you don't realize, extends pretty
<br />
far out into the net.world.  Several RL friends around me, who are not
<br />
into Sonic and don't know much about it, have had plenty of stories and
<br />
rumors to circulate.  I asked one of them what all he'd heard.  He knew
<br />
I had written some of these stories myself, so his answer was, &quot;You don't want
<br />
to know, but it would be a good idea to quit now.&quot;  So many people have
<br />
jumped on the bandwagon intent on throwing their own characters (if
<br />
not *themselves*) into the bunch, that there are all these stories out there
<br />
that serve as little more than a cry of &quot;Hey, look at me, I'm here too now!&quot;
<br />
or maybe a cry of, &quot;I'm better than Sonic!  I can save Mobius by myself!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I had a talk with a friend of mine once about what makes good fan-fic. 
<br />
It's the same thing that make the original material good:  decent
<br />
storywriting and a decent plot that involves the characters we all know and
<br />
love, not all these add-ons.  Maybe that's why many people here site
<br />
&quot;Bloodlines&quot; (Dan Drazen) and &quot;The Temporal Syndrome&quot; (Shawn Wolski) as their
<br />
favorite stories:  they are some of the best examples of writing that I have
<br />
seen, and they revolve around Sonic, Robotnik, and the other central
<br />
characters.  Any additional characters (such as Sandy) are there for the
<br />
story, not the other way around.  But is this what most of the recent fan-fic
<br />
has been like?  No.  Even my first stories don't fit this mold.  I was
<br />
caught up in it with the rest of us.  
<br />

<br />
And now, it seems there are authors who want to explore what the
<br />
Sonic characters might be doing (or will be doing) in their bedrooms. 
<br />
WHY??  Good grief, is it *that* titillating?  That's not what these
<br />
characters were created for, and, whether it's legal or not, if I was the
<br />
person or one of the people that created Sonic, Sally, Tails, and the other
<br />
characters, I would be insulted by this to no end.  It would really baffle
<br />
me that these people can't create their own characters and their own
<br />
universes to write these fantasies about, that they have to go and use my
<br />
characters, whom I had created for the purpose of telling G-rated stories, 
<br />
to get their kicks.
<br />

<br />
Well, like I said, I've had enough, and if nothing else, you won't have to
<br />
hear me rant and rave about this any more.
<br />

<br />
Ratman, please unsubscribe me from this list.
<br />

<br />
Bookshire, please remove my stories from your web-site.
<br />

<br />
Goodbye.
