<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How's this idea rate on a scale of 10?
</em><br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don't know about 1-10, but it's the best idea yet.  (I'd give it a 10, but
<br />
what if someone else comes up with a better idea?)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a tangential note, I got Chaotix today.  It's pretty good, except two
<br />
slight problems--SONIC AND TAILS!!!  Knuckles is the star and he travels with
<br />
his four little friends (which are on hff.mv.com).  They have some neat
<br />
abilities (like Espio who can walk on the ceiling and change colours.  Hee,
<br />
hee!), but can never substitute for the Happy Fun Fox and his Blue Buddy.
<br />

<br />
[Excerpt from the manual:]
<br />
[The story so far...]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tomorrow's the big opening day for Carnival island, a huge amusement
<br />
resort with the latest in high-tech rides and games.  As guardian of the
<br />
island, it's Knuckles' job to make sure nothing goes wrong before the grand
<br />
event.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, the evil Dr. Robotnik has other plans.  He needs fuel for
<br />
his latest diabolical devices, and the Power Emerald that supplies
<br />
electricity to the enitre island [the big green thing in Sonic &amp; Knuckles?]
<br />
fits the bill perfectly.  His awful new invention, the Combi Confiner, should
<br />
help him get rid of that annoying echidna and his friends.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Kuckles returns from patrolling the far end of the island, he
<br />
discovers that Dr. Robotnik has imprisoned all of his friends--Espio the
<br />
Chameleon, Mighty the Armadillo, Vector the Crocodile and Charmy Bee.  After
<br />
he chases the Doctor off, Knuckles discovers that he can rescue one friend at
<br />
a time by using Ring Power... only the power that sparks between the Rings
<br />
holds the two partners together like a magical rubber band.  Never held back
<br />
for long, Knuckles finds that with a little teamwork, he can use the
<br />
stretching and snapping action of the Ring Power to double--even triple--the
<br />
partners' speed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they need all the speed they can get.  As Dr. Robotnik drains the
<br />
power from Carnival Island, everything on the island begins to break down!
<br />
&nbsp;Robotnik must be stopped, or by tomorrow morning--the morning of Carnival
<br />
Island's big opening day--the grand amusement park will lie in ruins!
<br />

<br />
[The characters]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles the Echidna: Knuckles is the guardian of the island and of the
<br />
Emerald Pillar that it conceals.  When Dr. Robotnik invades the island, it's
<br />
up to the Echidna to set things right.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vector the Crocodile: This cool croc loves the rush of running when he
<br />
isn't jammin' with his friends, doing fancy footwork to the tunes on his
<br />
headset, or investigating the local food courts.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mighty the Armadillo: Mighty is just that.  He's strong, smart, and
<br />
confident, and he can't stand weakness in anything.  He's one of Knuckles'
<br />
good friends, and is determined to help save the island from Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charmy Bee: Surprisingly sophisticated for his 16 years, Charmy came to
<br />
the island in search of new types of flowers, and found a ton of trouble.
<br />
&nbsp;But he handles things in his usual quick, cool and charming way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Espio the Chameleon: This colorful chameleon values his freedom above all
<br />
else, and after he was freed from Dr. Robotnik's Combi Machine, he decided he
<br />
must stop the evil Doctor at all costs.  He has a hot temper and an intense
<br />
drive in everything he does, and sometimes his friend Charmy Bee has to
<br />
remind him of his manners.  Espio is quick and strong, and his whirling
<br />
attack is just the thing you need to get out of a tight spot.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These two robots claim they've escaped from the evil Doctor and want to
<br />
help... but could they be part of Robotnik's plot to slow Knuckles and his
<br />
friends down?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heavy the Robot: Heavy works as Robotnik's chief mechanic.  He's just as
<br />
his name says--heavy--and slow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bomb: Bomb works as Robotnik's other mechanic.  He's not very quick or
<br />
strong, and he blows up when things start looking bleak.
<br />

<br />
[Okay, now it's my turn.]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The game play is quite interesting since you're connected to somebody else
<br />
(either the computer or Player 2) by a giant rubber band.  This makes for
<br />
some interesting moves, but can get annoying at times.  There are two bonus
<br />
stages.  In one, you are free-falling down a large pit and must get points,
<br />
rings, or other items before you hit the exit.  The other is like the one in
<br />
Sonic 2.  It's a big hexagonal tube that you run down with mines, rings and
<br />
springs.  The object is to get a certian amount of blue spheres before the
<br />
you run out of rings.  (You begin with 100 and they constantly count down.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, it's a pretty good game, but not what I expected.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-B.B.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We apologize for the inconvenience.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-God's Final Message to His Creation, written in thirty-foot-high letters
<br />
of fire on top of the Quentulus Quazgar Mountains in the land of
<br />
Sevorbeupstry on the planet Preliumtarn, third out from the sun Zarss in
<br />
Galactic Sector QQ7 ActiveJ Gamma and guarded by the Lajestic Vantrashell of
<br />
Lob
