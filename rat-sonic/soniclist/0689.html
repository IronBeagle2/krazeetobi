<br />
Part 2.
<br />

<br />
The next day.
<br />
Somewhere deep within the Great Forest.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovercar was dying.  Apparantly the run-in with the robot 
<br />
patrollers had caused more damage than they had realized.  Shirley 
<br />
wasn't sure how much longer it would run.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 20 minutes later, she was sure.  No longer.  The engines cut 
<br />
off, and the hovercar plowed into the ground.  Shirley cradled Tolouse 
<br />
as everybody was thrown forward by the crash.  Nobody was hurt.  At 
<br />
least, not physically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley wrestled the doors open, and the 20 or so refugees exited 
<br />
the hovercar.  All were scared, most were crying, nobody knew what was 
<br />
to happen next.  All eyes were on Shirley.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shirley, tell us, please.  Do you know what on Mobius is going on 
<br />
here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at them wearily, holding Tolouse in her arms.  &quot;I 
<br />
don't know.  Jean was in the palace when it happened, and he called me 
<br />
just before---&quot;  She looked away as a tear rolled down the fur of her 
<br />
cheek.  &quot;I don't know.&quot;  Then an idea came to her.  &quot;The radio!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley got into the hovercar, and switched on the radio, praying 
<br />
it still worked.  It did.  The commercial frequencies were nothing but 
<br />
static, so she switched to the frequencies used by the Palace Guard.  
<br />
She picked up voices on one of the channels.  She fine-tuned it and 
<br />
turned up the volume for all to hear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deep, evil voice sounded through the hovercar's speakers.  
<br />
&quot;Snively, is it done yet?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was answered by a higher-pitched voice.  &quot;Yes, sir.  SWAT-Bots 
<br />
have travelled through all sections of the city, and virtually all 
<br />
citizens have---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively, what do you mean by, 'virtually'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a hesitation.  &quot;Well, sir, it...appears there were some 
<br />
attempts at escape...various reports show that---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The deep voice interupted again.  &quot;SNIVELY!!  I *trust* this is 
<br />
being taken care of?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y-y-yes, sir.  Hover-bots are patrolling the Great Forest for any 
<br />
signs of refugees.  I...I promise you, sir, if there are any refugees, 
<br />
they will be captured.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good, Snively, good.  Continue.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A note of relief was heard in the higher-pitched voice.  &quot;Thank 
<br />
you, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but static afterwards.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley switched off the radio and looked at the frightened faces 
<br />
around her.  She realized they were unsure of what to do, and were 
<br />
looking to her for guidance.  She sighed heavily, resting her head 
<br />
against the windshield.  Gods of Mobius, what am I to do?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mommy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down at Tolouse.  Although they were still glazed with 
<br />
fear, there was expectation in his eyes as well.  She sighed again.  If 
<br />
she didn't help them survive, who would?  Like it or not, she thought, 
<br />
I've been chosen to get us through this mess.  Lucky me.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley climbed out of the hovercar and looked around, trying to 
<br />
determine what they needed to do.  Ah!  That was it.  She cleared her 
<br />
throat, and tried to make her voice sound as confident as possible.  It 
<br />
wasn't easy.  &quot;Well...it, uh, looks like we're going to be here for a 
<br />
while, and we've got work to do.  We'll need to hide the hovercar, and 
<br />
we'll have to dig some burrows to hide ourselves in.  If those 'hover-
<br />
bots', whatever they are, are looking for us, we're going to have to 
<br />
live underground.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She studied the ground, then began digging with her bare paws.  
<br />
&quot;Come on!&quot; she persuaded.  A few joined her at first, and then 
<br />
eventually everybody was helping, even little Tolouse.  Shirley watched 
<br />
him, sadly.  Is this how he is going to grow up, without a father, as a 
<br />
refugee?  Tears wet the fur of her cheeks.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By nightfall, the hovercar had been covered over with foliage, and 
<br />
they had enough burrows for everyone to sleep in, safely hidden from any 
<br />
surveillance above.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, Shirley and Tolouse were awakened by a loud roar.  
<br />
Overhead, hover-bots were continuing their search through the Great 
<br />
Forest.  Shirley grabbed Tolouse and crawled as far back into the burrow 
<br />
as she could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is that, Mommy?&quot; Tolouse screamed, crying.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay, baby, it's okay.&quot;  Shirley said, rocking him back and 
<br />
forth.  She and the others had been careful to see that the burrows and 
<br />
the hovercar were as camouflaged as possible.  Still, she just knew that 
<br />
those machines would stop, and any minute they would be flushed out of 
<br />
the burrows and taken away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It didn't happen.  Soon the roar quieted to a whisper, and then was 
<br />
gone.  The hover-bots had moved elsewhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley could not hold it in any longer, and tears flowed as she 
<br />
thought of Jean, Tolouse, and what their lives were to become.  
<br />
Eventually, sleep returned, and Shirley slumped against the side of the 
<br />
burrow, holding tightly onto the sleeping Tolouse.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
And this is how their new life began, as refugees of the Great Forest.
<br />

<br />
to be continued
<br />
