Here are two Sonic storys I am working on. they have the same title 
<br />
but don't be confused.
<br />
One is meant to be a continuation of From Amy Rose, with Love
<br />
The other story features Knuckles. 
<br />

<br />
I need imput on these storys, because I have no idea what should 
<br />
happen next.
<br />
Also, I plan on changing the name of the Knuckles story, this name is 
<br />
just a 'promo'
<br />

<br />
Here they are!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Prologue (continued from &quot;From Amy Rose, with Love)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry I slapped you Sonic.&quot; Sally started, &quot;I'm going out with 
<br />
Antoine now. He's a prince.
<br />
Anyway I think we should see other animals.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess so.&quot; Sonic said. A tear formed in his eye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Comeon my princez.&quot; Antoine said, he smiled.
<br />
Sally smiled. She took Antoines hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine....yes.&quot;Sally said, her words full of meaning.
<br />
Sonic glared at Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;Antoine smiled and slid the ring on Sally's hand.
<br />
They held hands as they walked off into the sunlight.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Be Or Not To Be
<br />
Chapter One
<br />

<br />
THE NEXT DAY.....
<br />
Antoine slid out of bed slowly.  Antoine opened his eyes,and saw 
<br />
Sonic. Sonic had an angry look on his face.  Antoine fell out of bed. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ECKKK!&quot; Antoine screamed.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Shut-up Ant. You want to wake everybody?!&quot; Sonic said. A red 
<br />
hand-print wear Princess
<br />
Sally slapped Sonic was still visable. Sonic wore  green boxers. He 
<br />
looked like he was angry, but the way he told Antoine to shut-up, it 
<br />
was clear that he was not mad at Antoine, he was mad at Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatz to youz want?&quot; Antoine said, wide awake now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's Tails! He's gone! I woulda' gone to someone else, but they 
<br />
went on a mission. The only ones left are supposed to be Bunnie, Amy-
<br />
Rose, and Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank-you so much for you're ze encoragement&quot; Antoine said. He 
<br />
then quickly got dressed and they went outside. &quot;I thought you 
<br />
mightze want to knowz that me and my mon-sherie,Sally iz ouw you zay, 
<br />
engaded. Pleasez excuse my french.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that a joke Antoine?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No joke,me an ze Sally iz en-&quot; Antoine started, but Sonic 
<br />
interupted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not that 'twain! The part about &quot;Excusing your french&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am ze french, am I not?&quot; Antoine said, now becoming confused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind Ant.&quot;
<br />
They walked towards Tails hut. When they got there, Sonic pointed out 
<br />
that there was no sign of struggle, and no sign that Tails had ran 
<br />
away. The only possible thing Tsils could have done was followed the 
<br />
others on the mission. A top secret mission that is.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I zay we not worries about Tails. He's probally fine, no?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,trust me.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
THIS IS THE SECOND ONE.
<br />

<br />
To Be or not to Be
<br />
Chapter One
<br />

<br />
Knothole II on the floating island.....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knuckles, this is the last straw!!!!,&quot;Espio yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why? What did I do?!,&quot; Knuckles asked the chameleon. She turned 
<br />
her back to him. Vector leaned back in his chair at the meeting table,
<br />
&nbsp;studying a map of the island. There were several circles on the map 
<br />
where they had spotted Mecha Sonic. He had his legs proped up on 
<br />
another chair. He had an odd smile on his face, like he was HAPPY 
<br />
about the argument that was taking place.....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw you with that 'Princess Sally'! You kissed her, you know tha-
<br />
&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She kissed me!! It was a kiss on the check! Besides you and me are 
<br />
not going together! Thats why I didn't conplain when you kissed 
<br />
Vector.&quot; Knuckles glares at Vector. The crocodile simply shrugs; in 
<br />
such a way as saying 'leave me out of this'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Listen you two, drop it. We have much more IMPORTANT things to 
<br />
worry about, like finding Mecha, he has the chaos emerald after all!  
<br />
The floating island IS still falling!! Worry about personal matters 
<br />
later!,&quot;Vector screamed. Charmy Bee flew into the hut and almost 
<br />
knocked Vector over. &quot;GeEz! Whats YOUR promblem, lil' bee?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right! There are more important things to do!&quot; Knuckles 
<br />
said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Charmy!,&quot; Espio called,&quot;Find Sonic. You are the only one who can 
<br />
get there the fastest. Tell him to- er here,&quot; Espio wrote out a note 
<br />
for Sonic to read. Charmy Bee couldn't speak and that was a major 
<br />
weakness for him. She handed the note to Charmy Bee. He looked it 
<br />
over, and gave her a quick thumbs up. Charmy Bee flew out of the room.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What should I do?,&quot; Mighty the Armadillo asked Knuckles. He paced 
<br />
around the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmmm. You and Alisa go evacuate the island. Heres the parachutes 
<br />
for everyone. Oh! Heres two for you guys,&quot;  
<br />
The chipmunk and the Armadillo gave Knuckles a thumbs up. Knuckles 
<br />
threw them the parachutes. They held hands as they left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well?,&quot;Vector asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me and Espio will go hunt down Mecha. I think we will have an 
<br />
easier time finding him if we split up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You will stay here and wait for Sonic and the other freedom 
<br />
fighters.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sigh. I always get stuck with the boring stuff!&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
Chapter 2
<br />
......AND BRING SOME POWER RINGS. 
<br />

<br />
As Sonic read this, he looked troubled. The lil' waited for Sonic to 
<br />
respond. Sonic handed Charmy his note back, and sat down at the end 
<br />
of the bridge, the bee mimicing what Sonic did. They dangled their 
<br />
legs off the end of the bridge, undistrubed, thinking. Bunnie broke 
<br />
the peace. She came running up to Sonic, and almost tripped on Charmy,
<br />
&nbsp;which would have resulted in her falling into the lake.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIC! Little ole Ant left this note&quot; Bunnie said. She was 
<br />
practiculy in tears. &quot;It broke my little ole heart.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have how you say, decided to quit the Freedom Fighters.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've met those who treat me better- ANTOINE 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good riddins!&quot; Sonic said with a laugh. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIC! How could you say that? Ah mean the Sugah-fox has some 
<br />
good points!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like?&quot; Sonic crossed his arms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Um&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who would treat Antoine better?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHO CARES?&quot; Sonic said, rolling his eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;The Bee thrashed his arms in the air, trying to get some attention. 
<br />
Bunnie and Sonic both looked down at him. Charmy handed the note for 
<br />
Bunnie to read.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, get a power ring.&quot; Sonic stood up obediantly and put out 
<br />
his hand over the water, just in time for the power ring to float up.
<br />

<br />
Charmy and Bunnie grabbed hold of Sonic.
<br />
