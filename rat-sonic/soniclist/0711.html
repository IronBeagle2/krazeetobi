&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 10
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, what are you doing here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie hadn't had time to think before she felt herself
<br />
being grabbed by the scruff of the neck and being pushed up
<br />
against a wall.  But she breathed a sigh of relief when she
<br />
recognized the harsh whisper as belonging to Sandy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah'm here because Sally's tryin' to keep your hide in one
<br />
piece!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My hide isn't any of her business.  Or yours!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was no time to argue the point, because they both
<br />
heard the ominous warble of a siren.  That meant SWATbots were on
<br />
the way.  They started down the alley but only got halfway when
<br />
they saw the end of the alley blocked off by three SWATbots. 
<br />
Turning around, they saw three more closing in from where they
<br />
had entered.  The two quickly ducked into what appeared to be a
<br />
deserted loading dock.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got any ideas?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're going to have to take them on hand-to-hand.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And just how the hoo-ha are we supposed to do that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SWATbots only have an advantage because of those arm-
<br />
mounted blasters of theirs.  They aren't built or programmed for
<br />
close-quarter fighting.  They only have enough armour to shield
<br />
them from blaster fire.  Once you're in close, you have the
<br />
advantage because you've got their strength and they don't have
<br />
your intelligence.  Can you kick with those legs?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh-huh.  Why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aim for the hip.  The seam should pop like a bubble.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; Bunnie thought to herself.  &quot;Now the only
<br />
problem is gettin' close enough to those SWATbots to spit in
<br />
their eye!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With mechanical tread, the two ranks of SWATbots closed in
<br />
on the darkened loading dock.  &quot;SURRENDER, FREEDOM FIGHTERS!&quot; one
<br />
of them droned, &quot;BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Closer and closer they drew.  They stopped short of the dock
<br />
and began scanning the area.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was empty.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved into the shadow of the dock for a closer look. 
<br />
They continued to visually sweep the loading dock area, as they
<br />
were not programmed to look up at the ceiling area first, in case
<br />
a couple of freedom fighters were hanging just out of sight from
<br />
a ledge.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie and Sandy dropped down on the two closest bots.  On
<br />
the way down, Sandy grabbed a bot by the neck, and the head came
<br />
away as cleanly as a grape from a stem.  Tossing the head aside,
<br />
she then punched the next nearest bot in the chest, and it
<br />
crumbled in a shower of sparks.  As soon as Bunnie hit the
<br />
ground, she managed to get off a spin-kick that struck a bot
<br />
where its hip would have been.  Bunnie had never practiced this
<br />
maneuver and although she landed on her tail she was still in one
<br />
piece.  Which was more than could be said for the SWATbot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great move, Bunnie!  But work on your landings.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Bunnie didn't have time to think about that because she
<br />
found herself looking up at a SWATbot training its blaster right
<br />
between her eyes.  Before the SWATbot could get off a shot,
<br />
Sandy dropped to the ground and rolled directly underneath it. 
<br />
Looking up between its legs, she jammed her fist through the
<br />
bot's crotch and into its pelvis, then seemed to fish around for
<br />
something.  With a quick yank, she pulled out a thick support rod
<br />
and some wiring which she tossed aside.  The SWATbot shuddered
<br />
for an instant, then collapsed in a heap.  &quot;Ah don't blame him!&quot;
<br />
Bunnie thought.  That left two bots standing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Duck behind one!&quot; Sandy called out.  &quot;They won't target
<br />
each other!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie did so, and while the bot swung around to re-
<br />
establish the target on Bunnie, she used her own robotic arm to
<br />
punch a hole in the bot.  It was incredibly easy...and it was
<br />
also a rush!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then she saw the last standing SWATbot drawing a bead on
<br />
Sandy.  Emboldened by her victories, she ran to the bot and
<br />
grabbed it by the arm.  The instant she did so, Sandy grabbed the
<br />
other arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Make a wish!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two arms of the bot came away cleanly.  Its head spun
<br />
and it sputtered sparks for a second before going offline.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right!&quot; Bunnie shouted.  Sandy, however, was in no mood
<br />
to high-five her partner, for she saw that the alley had been
<br />
blockaded again by another half-dozen SWAT-bots.  The two ducked
<br />
back into the shadows to wait for them.  A minute later they were
<br />
still waiting.  The SWATbots weren't advancing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do Ah have a bad feelin' 'bout this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie didn't have to wait long, for almost instantly, the
<br />
door to the loading dock swung open and the two were drawn into
<br />
the darkness of the building by an irresistable force.  They
<br />
hurtled through the darkness, finally coming to rest with a bone-
<br />
jarring thud against a huge metallic surface: a plate magnet.  It
<br />
held them fast by their roboticized parts.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ladies, so nice of you to drop in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie and Sandy looked up.  In an observation room near the
<br />
ceiling of the chamber stood Robotnik.  He leaned into a
<br />
microphone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively, restrain the prisoners.  And wait until the magnet
<br />
has powered down.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights came up in the room--little more than a storeroom
<br />
with pipes and conduits running along the ceiling--and Snively
<br />
walked over to a nearby control panel.  Pulling down on a large
<br />
lever, Sandy and Bunnie could hear the hum of the electromagnet
<br />
begin to diminish.  Even before it loosed their grip on them,
<br />
Snively was approaching them with a blaster in one hand and two
<br />
sets of shackles in the other.  They were bound with their hands
<br />
behind their backs and frisked for weapons.  Snively took two
<br />
knives from Sandy: her curved Nomad blade and a second, longer,
<br />
straight-edged knife.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My, my,&quot; Robotnik said as he entered the room, &quot;didn't your
<br />
mother ever teach you that little girls shouldn't play with sharp
<br />
objects?  By the way, how is your mother?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I wasn't wearing these restraints,&quot; Sandy spat back,
<br />
&quot;I'd arrange a face-to-face meeting!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see; my sympathies,&quot; he said with absolutely no trace of
<br />
sincerity.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll be in need of sympathy yourself one of these days:
<br />
that robotic arm of yours is killing you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, no.  We get along quite nicely.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the truth!  It's slowly poisoning you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you want to put me out of my impending misery.  How
<br />
thoughtful.  No, I have other plans.  Snively, prepare the
<br />
roboticizer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At once, Sir.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as Snively was leaving the room, Sally and Bunnie heard
<br />
the tramp of SWATbots.  The six that had been cordoning off the
<br />
alley had followed them down the tunnel, and the door to the room
<br />
had shut behind them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you so ably demonstrated just now, my SWAT-bots are
<br />
somewhat lacking in your fighting expertise.  But you, Princess
<br />
Sandy, will make an excellent commander of my forces, once you
<br />
have been totally roboticized so as to answer to my bidding.  I
<br />
can use someone who knows the fighting skills of the Nomads.  And
<br />
just think of the irony: the army that finally destroys the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters will be led by Princess Sally's own
<br />
sister!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And as for you,&quot; he said as he turned his attention to
<br />
Bunnie, &quot;you won't be roboticized just yet--not until you've told
<br />
me everything I want to know about Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your dreams, Robotnik!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know what I dream of, my dear?  Ways of extracting
<br />
information from reluctant forest folk such as yourself.  You
<br />
WILL tell me what I want to know.  And I can assure you that the
<br />
method I will use to learn what I want to know from you will be
<br />
slower and more painful than necessary.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
<br />
