<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sonic fans and gamers would like to see and/or expect from another Sonic

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; game.  We're planning on having one out for the 32X, so I'd like to hear 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from all you Sonic fans.
</em><br />

<br />
Hrm.  What do I want in the next Sonic game?   Hrm.  Tricky.  Alot of good
<br />
suggestions have already been made by Paul Gettle, Fred Sloniker, Jamie 
<br />
Wilmoth, Craig Moore and Richard Ray II Roberts (hope I didn't forget 
<br />
anyone :)
<br />

<br />
::: Comments on previous games :::
<br />

<br />
I agreed with Fred Sloniker about Spinball Pinball about the graphics not 
<br />
being 'up to par' (the motion at times seemed sluggish).  Still fun though.
<br />

<br />
As mentioned before, the save game feature is a definite plus!  I know some
<br />
folks like to play for hours and hours at a time, but I prefer to give myself
<br />
a break after a while. 
<br />

<br />
I always liked the ability to play the game sounds in the option menu and
<br />
was disappointed to not see it in S3 &amp; S&amp;K (at least I didn't notice the 
<br />
ability when I rented them... haven't gotten around to buying them yet). 
<br />
A friend of mine used that feature to tape the S2 special 3-D stage music 
<br />
(and a few other songs) and occasionally plays them when driving (very 
<br />
appropriate for a particular stretch of winding road)... which reminds me.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone mentioned an Audio CD by Sega which featured some 'Sonic' game 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;music in a couple of tracks.  Is that just some crazy rumor?  Does this 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;CD exist?  If so, what's it called and where can I find it? (or can you 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'play' the Sonic-CD in an audio-cd player and get that)
<br />

<br />
::: Suggestions for new games :::
<br />

<br />
Giving Tails his own game sounds like fun.. Maybe he can have some special
<br />
new friends as partners of his very own.  Perhaps making it 'lock-on' able 
<br />
so Knuckles and Sonic can join in too.
<br />

<br />
Sonic and the freedom fighters in an RPG game sounds like a good idea.  I
<br />
was talking with a friend just yesterday and he had brought up that he'd 
<br />
like to see more RPG style games for the Sega.
<br />

<br />
As for how can the freedom fighters be in a multi-directional scrolling game
<br />
like most of the other Sonic games? :
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Sally could use Nicole for maps and to call on friends to help her out at 
<br />
&nbsp;spots.  (good idea whoever suggested it)
<br />
&nbsp;Bunnie Rabbot could use her bionic legs for high speed running or extra-high
<br />
&nbsp;jumping and her arm for plowing through areas like Sonic does w/ spin dashes.
<br />
&nbsp;Rotor could ride a motorized skateboard for extra speed... and maybe have a 
<br />
&nbsp;backpack w/ unfolding glider so he can float like Knuckles.
<br />
&nbsp;Gee.. I dunno what Antoine can do.. eep.. sorry Ant (I've heard alot of 
<br />
&nbsp;'get rid of Antoine' talk, but I say he'd be find if folks could find
<br />
&nbsp;SOMETHING useful for him [ whats wrong with being a good strategist yet
<br />
&nbsp;also being a kluts and a fraidy-cat.. I know folks like that :) ]
<br />

<br />
One idea I had which may or may not fly is this:   Why not in one of the 
<br />
levels.. play the big round guy (Robotnik)!  The objective being to capture 
<br />
some of the freedom fighters..  The last remaining freedom fighter would get 
<br />
away and that's who'd you'd play in the next levels in order to rescue 
<br />
Robotnik's captives. (once rescued you could choose one of them as a 
<br />
'partner' to help rescue others)
<br />

<br />
The ultimate idea would be to make a totally unique game featuring Sonic &amp; 
<br />
Friends.  A game unlike anything out there yet.  Something that's not a 
<br />
platform, shoot-em-up, puzzle, sports, fighting, pinball or roleplaying game.
<br />
Very tricky... it only happens once every few years.  If I knew what such 
<br />
a game would be, then I guess I could be a game designer :)
