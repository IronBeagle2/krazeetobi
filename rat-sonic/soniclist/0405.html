<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Along with the pages, I got a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; pack of Panini stickers (mostly small chunks of screenshots, like a water
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monitor and the victory pose of Sonic and Tails from Sonic 3)
</em><br />

<br />
There are _228_ different stickers available for the sticker album, but  
<br />
each pack holds only _five_ of them. There are also screenshots of the  
<br />
weekday cartoon (the 'Subterranean Sonic' episode) as well as some drawn  
<br />
pictures of the characters / Badniks.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and a card offering a tip for Sonic 2.
</em><br />

<br />
Not all collector cards are game tips cards. The others have cool pictures  
<br />
on them like the one with Sonic sitting in a chair wearing sunglasses or  
<br />
the one with Tails saying 'Prower Power'. The two prism cards I have (out  
<br />
of six) show the same motives that are on the SEGA telephone cards.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * The drawing in the Fleetway comics looks little like the Archie comic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the cartoons.
</em><br />

<br />
The Fleetway comic is mainly based on the games, remember?  .]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If I had to draw an analogy to anything Americans might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; have seen, the only thing that comes to mind is the painting of Sonic,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knuckles, Tails, and the gang in the Sonic 3 hintbook.  Not quite
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on-model, but okay-looking except for a few goofs (everyone has five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; digits, for instance,
</em><br />

<br />
In later issues of the Archie comic Sonic &amp; Tails _also_ have five fingers  
<br />
(although they should have only four according to the cartoon).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the characters introduced for the comic look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too much like humans with animal masks).  Not better or worse, IMHO, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certainly different.
</em><br />

<br />
But don't forget that the _important_ characters (Sonic / Tails /  
<br />
Knuckles) look like they should (IMHO) and not like Archie is doing them  
<br />
with too thick arms, too small heads, Knuckles without the 'special' smile  
<br />
we know from the posters etc.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; * The style of the stories is completely different; they seem to be aimed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at a slightly older audience, and thus instead of the relentless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slapstick of the Archie comics, we get superhero-style plots, complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with three-issue slugfests.  Also, since the stories are based more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; closely on the games, they sometimes read a little like transcripts of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; role-playing game sessions, i.e., rather dull when you're not controlling
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the protagonist.
</em><br />

<br />
Only _a few_ stories are partially based on the games because this is what  
<br />
people want to see when a new game hits the market. Archie does the same  
<br />
although _their_ stories have open endings and _no_ real plot at all (look  
<br />
at the ripoff of 'Sonic Spinball' in issue #6 or 'S&amp;K' in issue #13).
<br />

<br />
All the other stories in the Fleetway comic are _completely_ new although  
<br />
they sometimes occur at places we know from the games (Chemical Plant /  
<br />
Casino Night / Green Hills / Mystical Caves etc.). But there are also a  
<br />
lot of new places (like the 'Nameless Zone' where Tails is called to in  
<br />
most of his solo stories to fight some enemies in a middle-aged magical  
<br />
environment) and a lot of new characters like the Marxio Brothers (three  
<br />
electricians who control the Casino Night Zone).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The major difference is the change in supporting cast characters;
</em><br />

<br />
Because the SatAM cartoon can't be seen in England (as far as I know).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of Sally, Bunnie, and the rest, we have Amy Rose (the pink hedgehog from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the Sonic CD game), Porker Lewis (a cowardly pig with technical skills
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; who reminds me vaguely of Antoine, but isn't nearly as annoying), a male
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rabbit (whose name I never did see),
</em><br />

<br />
His name is Johnny Lightfoot.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Kintobor (a floating holographic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; head who looks like the generic egghead professor and is apparently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; intended to be Robotnik's good counterpart).
</em><br />

<br />
In the Fleetway storyline, a malfunction in one of Kintobors inventions  
<br />
transformed him into the evil Robotnik (also a nice example for backwards  
<br />
spelling). However, his former personality got caught in one of the Power  
<br />
Rings and was implemented into the computer by Porker Lewis.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The base of the resistance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; is also a sophisticated underground bunker, complete with TVs and various
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; electronic gear.
</em><br />

<br />
This bunker once was Kintobors secret laboratory.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If anyone wants more details, feel free to ask me (or him, of course).
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Oh, by the way: that was a very sneaky thing to do, Alessandro, packing a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; cliffhanger into that envelope.  (:3
</em><br />

<br />
?? Did I forget to copy some of the pages? Darn...
<br />

<br />
Take it easy
<br />

<br />

<br />
