&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the part Sonic always hated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn't mind checking in with his Uncle Chuck, who worked
<br />
for the Freedom Fighters as a spy in Robotnik's midst.  He
<br />
enjoyed seeing him, despite the fact that Uncle Chuck's body had
<br />
been roboticized.  What he hated was leaving.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One of these days, Uncle Chuck, I'm checkin' you out of
<br />
this dump and gettin' you back to Knothole so we can deroboticize
<br />
you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nobody's looking forward to it more than I am, Sonie, but
<br />
until they've got the bugs worked out of the system, I'm needed
<br />
here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know.  But it still stinks!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what I get for building a hideout in a garbage
<br />
dump,&quot; he smiled.  &quot;Now scoot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic gave his Uncle a hug, said &quot;Be cool!&quot; and jammed off
<br />
into the twilight streets of Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he ran the well-known streets to the edge of the city,
<br />
Sonic wondered how soon it would be before he could make good on
<br />
his promise to Uncle Chuck.  Some days, it seemed as if the
<br />
Freedom Fighters of Mobius weren't making any headway against
<br />
Robotnik.  They were able to slow down Robotnik and his spoiling
<br />
of the planet, but there still didn't seem to be a way of rolling
<br />
it back and returning things to the way they were.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These thoughts so preoccupied Sonic that he almost didn't
<br />
hear the approaching whine of SWATbot patrols.  He ducked down an
<br />
alley just in time.  He could hear the SWATbot intercom:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ALL UNITS IN SECTORS D4, D6, AND D7.  ASSISTANCE NEEDED IN
<br />
SECTOR D5.  RESPOND IMMEDIATELY!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strange.  Usually there were enough SWATbots patrolling a
<br />
given area to take care of anything.  If they needed that much
<br />
backup, they must be up against something big!  Sonic couldn't
<br />
resist--he had to check this out!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the SWATbot hover unit from a discreet distance,
<br />
Sonic trailed it to an area adjacent to the trash heap that was
<br />
one of the Freedom Fighter rendezvous points.  Afraid that one of
<br />
his comrades was in danger, he cautiously approached to get a
<br />
better look.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw a number of SWATbots...at least a dozen...converging
<br />
on someone, someone Sonic didn't recognize.  It was a badger.  He
<br />
was tall and built like a barrel.  Two leatherlike straps crossed
<br />
his muscular chest and held up a belt from which hung two small
<br />
hatchets.  The badger was using a third ax--a double-headed ax on
<br />
a long, stout pole--to ward off the SWATbots.  He'd already
<br />
destroyed several SWATbots with it, judging from the pieces on
<br />
the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had heard that there were few things on Mobius as
<br />
impressive as a badger in combat, but he hadn't really believed
<br />
it until now.  The badger didn't just lash out blindly as the
<br />
SWATbots tried to approach.  He made the most of every move,
<br />
making sure that every backswing was at least as effective and as
<br />
lethal as every thrust.  But it was clear that the badger was
<br />
beginning to tire and that the SWATbots would soon have him.  The
<br />
fact that the badger hadn't been blasted meant that he was
<br />
supposed to be taken alive.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not if Sonic the Hedgehog had anything to say about it!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's time to play 'Bowling for Bots!'&quot; Sonic announced. 
<br />
The SWATbots turned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEDGEHOG--PRIORITY ONE!  APPREHEND....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the SWATbot never finished his sentence, for Sonic had
<br />
gone into Sonic Spin mode and simply plowed into the SWATbots.  A
<br />
second later, only two were standing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stand back, big guy,&quot; Sonic said to the badger, &quot;I've got
<br />
to pick up the spare.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the spin again, Sonic plowed into one bot, ricocheted
<br />
off him and took out the other one.  He turned back to the
<br />
badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you OK?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the badger didn't answer.  Instead, his eyes narrowed
<br />
and he pulled one of the smaller hatchets from his belt.  Before
<br />
Sonic could say or do anything, the badger hurled it in Sonic's
<br />
direction.   It missed the hedgehog, sailing over his head.  The
<br />
next thing Sonic knew, he heard a dull, metallic CLANG.  He
<br />
turned to see one of the SWATbots he thought he had taken out
<br />
still standing, but it now had a badger hatchet buried in its
<br />
head.  It shuddered for an instant and then fell to the ground. 
<br />
Sonic turned to the badger, extending a hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa, I owe you one, fella!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the badger didn't say anything right away.  He only
<br />
looked at Sonic with a curious expression, as if he were coming
<br />
out of a trance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic?  Sonic Hedgehog?&quot; he finally asked in a deep, smooth voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's my name--don't wear it out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A broad smile slowly crossed the badger's face. &quot;Sonic...
<br />
Sonic, it's me!  Spartacus!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog's eyes widened.  &quot;No way!&quot; he squealed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two embraced, which was easier for the badger who was half again 
<br />
as tall as Sonic.  It was rather like a child hugging a doll, and Sonic
<br />
came off the worse for it.  When the badger
<br />
loosened his grip, Sonic was still gasping for air.  &quot;Man,&quot; Sonic
<br />
finally said, &quot;you've gotten...HUGE!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think I'm big, you should see Adonis!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, we'd better get out of here before we tangle with any
<br />
more bots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic led Spartacus through the dump, down the twisting path
<br />
known to the Knothole Freedom Fighters.  Several minutes later,
<br />
Sonic and Spartacus paused in the evening shade at the edge of
<br />
the Great Forest.  Waiting in the shadows were two figures: Tails
<br />
and Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonique, what is the meandering of this?  Who is this
<br />
stranger?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This 'stranger' was once my best bud when I was a kid. 
<br />
Spartacus, this is my pal, Tails.  And that's Antoine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi!&quot; Tails said as he shook the badger's massive hand. 
<br />
Antoine, however, seemed even stiffer and more aloof than usual. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And wherefore were you doing in the dumps?&quot; he asked the
<br />
badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Making a mistake I'll never make again!  For the last four
<br />
months now, we badgers haven't been able to work our traditional
<br />
mines in the hills north of the Great Forest because of increased
<br />
SWATbot activity.  As a result, we haven't been able to fashion
<br />
new weapons.  I thought I could find some high-quality metal to
<br />
bring back to our smiths to forge into ax heads.  Instead all I
<br />
found was scrap.  And then the SWATbots found me.  I was fighting
<br />
them off when Sonic showed up and saved my life.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How is it you are knowing Sonique?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We go way back, Ant,&quot; Sonic began.  &quot;We were both like five
<br />
years old when he came to Mobotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My family lived deep in the Great Forest with the other
<br />
badgers of our clan.  But about that time my father got very
<br />
sick, and it was more than our healers could handle.  So my
<br />
mother, my brother Adonis and I brought our father to
<br />
Mobotropolis, to the hospital.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And did they help him get better?&quot; Tails asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My father was in the hospital for three months, but he
<br />
never seemed to get better.  Finally he died.  That's when I got
<br />
this,&quot; he said as he indicated a long diagonal scar across his
<br />
chest.  &quot;I was cut to mourn his passing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd never been in the city before and I guess it showed.  I
<br />
got teased pretty badly by some of the other kids.  Until Sonic
<br />
stood up for me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, it just seemed to me like you needed a friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you were a good friend, Sonic.  I...I only wish I could
<br />
have told you when my father died.  But we left Mobotropolis with his
<br />
body at the first opportunity, to bury him with his fathers. 
<br />
This is our way.  And as it turned out, we left the city two days
<br />
before Robotnik took over.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Talk about your great timing!&quot; Sonic said.  &quot;I wondered
<br />
what happened to you; it was like you just disappeared.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When a badger dies, his family turns its back on the world for a
<br />
time of mourning.  But what about yourself, Sonic?  How have you fared?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Better than fair.  We're freedom fighters, living in
<br />
Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badger's brow furrowed.  &quot;Knothole?  I've never heard of
<br />
it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is just as well, for we are needing to keep it a
<br />
secretion,&quot; Antoine said with more than a hint of nervousness in
<br />
his voice.  &quot;In factuality, we must be returning there *tout
<br />
suite*!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But...&quot; Sonic began.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I understand,&quot; Spartacus said.  &quot;I have to get back to the
<br />
clan myself.  But can you meet me here tomorrow at noon?  So we
<br />
can catch up on old times?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No prob!&quot; Sonic said, getting in a quick elbow shot to
<br />
Antoine's ribs to prevent further interruption.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine.  It really is good to see you again, Sonic.  Until
<br />
tomorrow, then.&quot;  And with that, the badger turned and walked
<br />
into the Great Forest.  He moved with a speed and a quietness
<br />
that belied his size, and he was soon lost from sight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Ant!  Who put the starch in YOUR shorts?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;About what are you talking?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know about what I'm talking!  Spartacus was my bud, and
<br />
you treated him like pond scum!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We will see what the Princess has to be saying about this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;And with that, Antoine turned and headed back for Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow!&quot; Tails whispered.  &quot;I've never seen Antoine so uptight
<br />
before!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, he's just being his usual obnoxious self.  Let's give
<br />
him a head start; I'll bet you BOTH of us can still beat him back
<br />
to Knothole.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Sonic had hoped that Sally would be more understanding
<br />
than Antoine, he was in for a surprise when he returned to
<br />
Knothole (after having left Antoine in his dust) and told Sally
<br />
about his reunion with Spartacus.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you believed his story?&quot; was what Sally said.  Sonic
<br />
was shocked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course I believed it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally's brow furrowed.  She consulted her hand-held
<br />
computer.  &quot;Nicole, verify.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;LATEST INTELLIGENCE REPORTS INDICATE INCREASED ACTIVITY BY
<br />
ROBOTNIK IN THE MOUNTAINS NORTH OF THE GREAT FOREST.  HIGH
<br />
PROBABILITY THAT SUCH ACTIVITY WOULD DISRUPT TRADITIONAL BADGER
<br />
MINING....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's enough, Nicole,&quot; Sally said as she closed up the
<br />
computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So where's my apology, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't hold your breath waiting for it, Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's with you, Sal?  This isn't like the time when we ran
<br />
into Ari -- I KNOW Spartacus!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I don't want to believe you've forgotten EVERYTHING
<br />
you ever learned.  Don't you remember anything about the Clan
<br />
Wars?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The who?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is hopeless!  Between the 24th and 28th centuries, the
<br />
badger clans were split into two factions.  One faction
<br />
challenged the legitimacy of the House of Acorn to rule Mobius
<br />
and waged war against it.  The other faction defended the House
<br />
of Acorn.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, so some of the badger clans and the House of Acorn
<br />
didn't get along; so what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So during that time, there were six attempts made against
<br />
the lives of members of the House of Acorn; four of them
<br />
succeeded.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, this is ancient history!  What's all this got to do
<br />
with Spartacus?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally paused for a moment.  &quot;Look, just promise me one
<br />
thing: don't tell him or show him where Knothole is located.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sal, you know I'd never do anything stupid like that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just promise, OK?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, OK!  All of a sudden I need some fresh air,&quot; he added
<br />
as he dashed out of Sally's hut and headed for the pond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine, who had heard most of the conversation, sat down on a
<br />
nearby chair.  &quot;You were handling that very well, my Princess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No I didn't.&quot; Sally sat down on the edge of her bed, her chin
<br />
resting in her hands.  &quot;I totally blew it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What was it to be blowing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine...I was afraid.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But you were having every reason....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what if Sonic's right?  What if it IS all ancient
<br />
history?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I am supposing you are not having anything to be
<br />
worried about to meet this friend of Sonique's.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine, you're absolutely right!&quot;  Sally rose and, after
<br />
giving Antoine a kiss on the cheek, left her hut to find Sonic. 
<br />
Antoine was confused by Sally's meaning, but having been on the
<br />
receiving end of a kiss from her he didn't care that much.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me again why you're doing this. Sal.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally arrived at the appointed spot just before
<br />
noon.  Sonic had been just as confused as Antoine about Sally's
<br />
about-face on Sonic's meeting with Spartacus, but Sally still hadn't
<br />
explained why she now insisted on accompanying Sonic to the rendezvous.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I thought you could understand....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, try me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not yet.  When is your friend, uh...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spartacus.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spartacus.  When's he supposed to be here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm here now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Sonic and Sally jumped at the voice behind them.  It
<br />
was indeed Spartacus, this time with only one hatchet hanging
<br />
from his belt.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, where'd you learn to be so quiet?  And where'd you
<br />
come from, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Part of it is training in stalking; the rest comes
<br />
naturally.  As for where I came from, I came down that trail.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked for several seconds.  &quot;WHAT trail?&quot; he finally
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's always a trail, if you know how to look for one. 
<br />
It's all part of my training as a tracer -- one who follows
<br />
tracks through the forest.  The elders tell me I'm pretty good at
<br />
it.  But enough about me; who's your friend?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spartacus, this is Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pleased to meet you.&quot;  For several seconds, Sally could
<br />
only stare at him while three words ran through her mind: &quot;Drop
<br />
dead gorgeous!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Likewise,&quot; she said finally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't know that you'd be bringing her, Sonic.  Are you
<br />
two...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Spartacus,&quot; Sally broke in, &quot;I came with Sonic because I
<br />
need to know something.  I need to know how your clan feels about
<br />
the House of Acorn.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus paused for several seconds.  Sonic was sure he
<br />
could see his old friend's face flush crimson.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's to our...shame...that some badgers still want to
<br />
fight the old battles.  They're mostly old badgers who entertain
<br />
old notions.  The younger warriors, those of my generation, know
<br />
that Robotnik is the true enemy.  Why do you ask?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because I loved, and have lost, someone very close to the
<br />
throne of the last Acorn King.  And if this should get in the way
<br />
of your friendship with Sonic....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry about it,&quot; Spartacus said gently, resting a
<br />
massive paw reassuringly on her shoulder.  &quot;When I deal with
<br />
Sonic, I see only him.  And when I deal with Sonic's friends, I
<br />
see only that friendship and I respect it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, Spartacus.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, what is this 'Knothole' place you mentioned?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the next several hours, Sonic and Spartacus reviewed for
<br />
each other the lives they had lived since their parting as
<br />
children.  Sonic mentioned as much as he could about Knothole
<br />
without giving away its position.  He also failed to mention that
<br />
Sally was, herself, of the House of Acorn, and that she had been
<br />
speaking of her father earlier on when she spoke of her loss.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spartacus, for his part, described life among a badger clan.
<br />
It was a rugged life with few physical comforts -- fewer, even,
<br />
than Knothole -- and one given over to preserving the old ways of
<br />
the clan.  Yet Sally detected a note of disenchantment in
<br />
Spartacus's voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I sometimes ask myself,&quot; Spartacus told her, &quot;what the
<br />
point is of learning to fight if there's no opponent to fight. 
<br />
Sonic told you of my encounter with the SWATbots; in some ways I
<br />
was unprepared to fight them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You didn't look that unprepared to ME!&quot; Sonic chimed in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks, but we've never really trained to fight Robotnik or
<br />
his forces.  I feel there's much we can learn from your
<br />
experiences.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then why not fight by our side, and learn from us?&quot; Sally
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Such a matter would have to come before our clan elders,
<br />
many of whom still think the House of Acorn is the true enemy of
<br />
badgers.  They consider Robotnik to be something best left
<br />
alone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, why don't you kick some of those old guys out of
<br />
their jobs?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You don't know our ways, Sonic.  The power they hold over
<br />
the clan is due to their length of days and experience in combat.
<br />
It will be a while before enough of them rest with their fathers
<br />
for the old prejudice to become the minority view.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, I'd sure like to tell those old guys what's really
<br />
happening to Mobius!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why don't you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come visit the clan tomorrow evening, as my guests and as
<br />
my friends.  Put your case before them.  The worst that can
<br />
happen is that they'll reject your proposal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Will they let us in?&quot; Sally asked.  &quot;We ARE outsiders, and
<br />
not of the clan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You have also fought against Robotnik most of your lives. 
<br />
They will respect you for that, if for no other reason.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally considered it for a few seconds.  &quot;Very well, then:
<br />
tomorrow evening.&quot;  She extended a hand and Spartacus took hold
<br />
of it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Agreed.  Meet me back here an hour before sunset; I'll
<br />
guide you to the clan myself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon, Spartacus had once more melted back into the Great
<br />
Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, Sonic, let's get back to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothin' doin', Sal.&quot;  Sonic stayed rooted to the spot, his
<br />
arms crossed in front of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Seems to me that someone here owes someone else here an
<br />
apology.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right,&quot; Sally admitted, &quot;I'm sorry I distrusted your
<br />
friend.  I shouldn't have been so suspicious.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's better!  Now, why can't you say that more often?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why can't you be right more often?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the banter continued all the way back to Knothole.
<br />
