<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not wishing to get off-topic, but DESPITE the shoddy animation, which really
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was the BEST on TV at that point in time, it's the STORIES which determine
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whether legitimacy should be conferred or not. Many of those stories on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TREK animated series do warrant inclusion into the continuity, especially
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; YESTERYEAR, MORE TROUBLES MORE TRIBBLES and THE COUNTER-CLOCK INCIDENT. It
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would be like trying to dismiss a legitimate SONIC story on the basis that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there was one aspect you didn't like.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, there have been several Sonic shows that were dismissed in
<br />
just that fashion: &quot;Ro-Becca,&quot; &quot;Ghost Busted,&quot; &quot;Fed Up With Antoine.&quot;
<br />
Fan reaction when they aired was negative and immediate.  The &quot;one
<br />
aspect&quot; that tipped it in was probably Antoine -- personally, I always
<br />
thought the character too over the top to be believable, even as comic
<br />
relief.  And, of course, the daily syndicated series has long had low
<br />
credibility with Sonic fans -- at least, the ones who have spoken up on
<br />
this board.  Its vision of Mobius was so far out of character that it
<br />
was simply repudiated.  One or two guest characters may have registered,
<br />
but overall it feels like it's taking place on another planet. 
<br />

<br />
I guess we should count our blessings.  I'd forgotten that once upon a
<br />
time Filmation stuff was considered &quot;best&quot; because nobody else was
<br />
cranking anything out.  Nowadays Disney and Warner Bros. have
<br />
high-quality product all over the dial, and there's a host of innovative
<br />
series out there, from &quot;Reboot&quot; to MTV's excellent adaptation of &quot;The
<br />
Maxx.&quot;  BTW, that's a nice phrase, &quot;the continuity.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for stuff &quot;ending up on the cutting room floor&quot;, as it were, you'd be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; amazed at how many bits haven't been used in every story or changed because
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of one reason or another. In fact, it's only recently that we're able to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; develop the stories we can BECAUSE THERE ISN'T ANY ANIMATED SERIES to lead
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the cart. I fully believe after working on the KNUCKLES mini-series recently
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that if this were the situation when we did the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the very least the villain and the mission would have been allowed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; originally intended. I can't say more in case we can do that story in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
You confirmed my suspicion that the changes in the Princess Sally
<br />
miniseries -- changes that were only hinted at in the notice in the
<br />
Sonic-grams of Sonic #21 -- were quite substantial.  &quot;The villian and
<br />
the mission&quot;!  No wonder the cover art changed so drastically.  Hope you
<br />
get a chance to do your original story.  Not that there was a serious
<br />
problem with the story line that finally emerged, but I guess I have a
<br />
general curiosity about &quot;what might have been.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Looking forward to FINALLY getting a chance to read #36 this weekend:
