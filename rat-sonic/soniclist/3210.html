Although I know everyone has been talking about this game
<br />
4 a VERY long time, I just got the latest issue of Game Players
<br />
magazine (I read and am subscribed to several mags) and it has
<br />
a World Exclusive (yeah right) review of Sonic for Saturn!
<br />

<br />
Just for those who haven't been able to get their hands on this
<br />
mag yet, I've decided to give some highlights of the
<br />
four-page (and what a sweet 4 it is) Sonic section...
<br />

<br />
[Sonic's new abilities:
<br />
SpinBash: A quick forward attack modified from the Spindash
<br />
SpinSlash: A mid-air, 360 degree attack
<br />
Ring Throwing: Just what you've always wanted Sonic to be able to do.
<br />

<br />
The Story-Line: Sonic Saves The Day
<br />

<br />
The new story intoduces two new characters - one, an old man named
<br />
Professor Gazebo Boobowski and the second, his daughter named
<br />
Tiara B. Neither character is playable in the game but they are both
<br />
well-represented in the game's cinematics and there is always the
<br />
possibilitiy of future involvement in later adventures.
<br />

<br />
(Just a little note from me, SUPER STH: Cinematics... YES!!! And
<br />
Tiara's a hot lookin' Hedgehog... uh oh, Sally...)
<br />

<br />
As with every great hero, Sonic's greatest joy in life comes from saving
<br />
his friends from the clutches of evil, and in Sonic X-Treme, very little
<br />
has changed! At the beginning of the game, we find Sonic doing a 
<br />
little surfing when he sees the Bluestreak distress signal in the sky.
<br />
The signal is coming from Professor Gazebo Boobowski and his daughter
<br />
Tiara B (Sonic in drag? You make the call). Keepers of the six magical
<br />
Rings of Order, and the castle wherein they practice the anchient art 
<br />
of ring smithing,
<br />

<br />
(Another note from me: THEY do ring smithing? But I thought Chuck
<br />
was the only one... hmmmmm....)
<br />

<br />
Boobowski and Tiara are in fear that Dr. Robotnik, Sonic's archnemesis
<br />
(duh), is after their precious rings. Dr. Robotnik has, at this point,
<br />
already
<br />
made one attempt at stealing the Rings of Order. It is determined that only
<br />
Sonic can fight off Robotnik's attempt and to do so, he will need to collect
<br />
the six rings himself. From there, Sonic sets off to gather the six magic
<br />
Rings of Order, battling Robotnik's Badniks along the way. Just another
<br />
say in the life of a super hedgehog.]
<br />

<br />
There is MUCH more to the article than this, so to those of you who are
<br />
interested (I would be if I was you), go to the store and buy it! 
<br />

<br />
P.S: It's real easy to find... it's got a big picture of Sonic on the cover.

&quot;Hi. My name's Sonic, and I'm a ringaholic. Somebody help me!&quot; - Sonic
