The Chaotix comic just appeared in my local stores; I was very surprised to
<br />
see it this early.
<br />

<br />
This message contains detailed information on the Chaotix comic.  If you have
<br />
not read this book, do not read any further unless you want to see what
<br />
happens before reading the book.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ch: Knuckles, Charmy Bee, Vector, Mighty, Espio
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below, Robotnik says, &quot;I can't believe it!  They're
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fighting each other instead of me!
<br />

<br />

<br />
The Chaos Effect, Part 1
<br />
========================
<br />
The Freedom Fighters go to an amusement park.  Renfield T. Rodent leads
<br />
them into the Hall of Mirrors.  Sally doesn't like the way she appears
<br />
in the mirror, but Rotor, Tails, and Antoine like the way they appeared.
<br />
Sonic senses something is wrong.  Suddenly, a light comes on and the
<br />
Freedom Fighters are trapped inside the mirrors.  Robotnik emerges and
<br />
tells Knuckles that he and Renfield were responsible.  Knuckles is about
<br />
to use his knuckles on Robotnik but finds he can't:  Robotnik also 
<br />
transformed Knuckles' body leaving his powers null and void.
<br />

<br />
The Chaos Effect, Part 2
<br />
========================
<br />
Knuckles contemplates his situation.  Then comes the grand debut of Charmy
<br />
Bee, Espio, Vector (portrayed as a rap musician), Mighty the Armadillo (who
<br />
can walk through mountains), and Heavy and Bomb.  Heavy and Bomb say they
<br />
were Robotnik's prized robots, but he inadvertently let them gain consciences.
<br />
Knuckles doubts them, but they prove themselves by bringing the Chaotix to
<br />
Robotnik's power gems and experimental weapons cache.
<br />

<br />
The Chaos Effect, Part 3
<br />
========================
<br />
Thinking he has won, Robotnik compliments Renfield on a job well done.  But
<br />
Knuckles triggers an alert at Robotnik's headquarters.  Caught off-guard,
<br />
Robotnik releases an upgraded Mecha-Sonic.  Charmy Bee and Espio lead the
<br />
fight against Mecha-Sonic, followed by Knuckles and Vector, and then Mighty
<br />
gives it a final punch.  Just when the Chaotix think they can relax, a large
<br />
red mechanoid approaches.  Knuckles himself becomes large using the power gem.
<br />
The red mechanoid crashes into the hall of mirrors, setting the Freedom
<br />
Fighters free.  Robotnik escapes on a moon rocket but doesn't allow Renfield
<br />
to escape with him.  Renfield tries to escape alone but is soon caught in a
<br />
cage and taken away.
<br />

<br />
===============
<br />
The Chaotix frolic in a game of tag.  Charmy tags Mighty, Mighty tags
<br />
Vector, Vector tags Espio, Espio tags Charmy, &quot;... and the game goes on!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The Hunt Is On!
<br />
===============
<br />
Knuckles races in and informs they are under attack but he's not quite
<br />
sure who the attacker is.  He says, &quot;There's a new player in town --
<br />
calls himself Archimedes.  It's not clear if he's a friend or foe!&quot;.
<br />
Suddenly, Vector falls into a deep hole.  As the others prepare to get
<br />
him out, they come under attack.  A robot appears and reaches towards
<br />
Mighty who looks forward to the challenge of fighting it -- and both end
<br />
up on the ground.  Knuckles and Espio begin to run.  When they pause, a
<br />
pair of hands appears behind them and silently snatches Espio away.  Now
<br />
Knuckles must choose between his friends and protecting the Floating Island.
<br />
