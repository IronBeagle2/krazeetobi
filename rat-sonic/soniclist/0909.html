<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: &quot;Erich Schulman (KTN4CA) -- Team OS/2&quot; &lt;acme_at_use.usit.net&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This question pertains to Archie Comics Sonic issue #24 and would be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;considered to contain a spoiler if you want to know nothing at all about 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the story before reading the comic yourself.  My copy finally arrived today.
</em><br />

<br />
Here's a form feed for extra protection :^)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by &quot;Sally&quot; in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beginning of the story?
</em><br />

<br />
No, but she is kind of cute (no Buttermilk Slappy though...)
<br />

<br />
This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:
<br />

<br />
When Hedgehogs Collide!
<br />

<br />
written by Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders
<br />
Pencils by Dave Manak (Chapters 1 and 2) and Art  Mawhinney (Chapters 3 and 4)
<br />
Inks by Harvo (??)    (Chapters 1 and 2) and Rich Koslowski (Chapters 3 and 4)
<br />

<br />
The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
<br />
various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a 
<br />
medieval village - various vendors selling stuff in the &quot;town square&quot;, etc.
<br />
Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
<br />
run around in motorized vehicles?)
<br />

<br />
Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
<br />
alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
<br />
Robotnik is a &quot;kindly ol'... grade-A wimp!&quot;, and the SWATbots do all the 
<br />
work, so life is boring (at least for bad guys like these).  So they 
<br />
decided for kicks to come to &quot;our dimension&quot; (rather handy how they can hop 
<br />
on the &quot;cosmic interstate&quot; whenever they want) and make trouble for our 
<br />
heroes.  Drooling fanboys should note that this chapter has a few shots of 
<br />
the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
<br />
stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)
<br />

<br />
Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
<br />
Antoine come through Rotor's &quot;Timespace Matter Projector&quot; (TM) back from 
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot;, but couldn't &quot;pierce the ZONE OF SILENCE where Robotnik 
<br />
exiled Sally's dad KING ACORN!&quot;  ????  Nice exchange between Sonic and 
<br />
Nicole here...
<br />

<br />
Sally almost catches them talking about their attempt, and there's a brief 
<br />
reference to the Princess Sally Miniseries story.  However, before either 
<br />
can talk about (or evade :^)) these topics, the angry villagers attack them 
<br />
thinking they're the bad guys.  Our heroes escape to figure out what to do...
<br />
(Note: Tails flies off with Antoine, Sally hitches a ride with Sonic, and 
<br />
Rotor flies off with a jetpack.)
<br />

<br />
The &quot;Sonic art&quot; pinup is nothing special.
<br />

<br />
Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
<br />
&quot;leathers&quot;; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
<br />
a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
<br />
place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  
<br />

<br />
The imposters decide to attack a band of &quot;poor innocent gypsies&quot; who, 
<br />
natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
<br />
bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
<br />
(paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
<br />
matched, so Sally yells &quot;Change partners!&quot; and this does the job.
<br />

<br />
The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic &quot;game over - you lose!&quot; 
<br />
and he gets the reply: &quot;Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
<br />
came for!  A fight!&quot;  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
<br />
with himself, and he replies &quot;Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic &amp; 
<br />
Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
<br />
the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
<br />
more enthused about either...
<br />

<br />
Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
<br />
Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
<br />
(actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
<br />
was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
<br />
There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
<br />
one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)
<br />

<br />
That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...
<br />
