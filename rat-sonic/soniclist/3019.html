&lt;Physics stuff snipped&gt;
<br />
Main points:
<br />

<br />
1) Someone riding on Sonic's back COULD move above light-speed, provided one can do 
<br />
that without becoming energy and that rider was shielded from the wind.
<br />

<br />
2) Assuming Sonic accelerates to mach one (300m/s) in ten seconds, the rider would be 
<br />
subjected to 30m/s^2 (or three EARTH gees)
<br />

<br />
3) Assuming Sonic would deaccelerate from mach one to zero in three 	      
<br />
seconds(!), the rider would be subjected to -100m/s^2 (or ten EARTH gees)
<br />

<br />

<br />
My responses:
<br />

<br />
1) This would also depend on Sonic.  Not only would Sonic have to be    shielded from 
<br />
the wind, but he would have to expend the infinite energy required to move at light 
<br />
speed.  If he was able to use an    organically-generated subspace warp field (like in 
<br />
Star Trek), he might be able to do this, but:
<br />

<br />
-Air resistence is still a factor
<br />

<br />
-I have a hard time believing that Sonic could generate a subspace warp field without 
<br />
equipment
<br />

<br />
-Unless Sonic wanted to make himself pass out from too many gravities, he would have to 
<br />
accelerate slowly (even at 1000m/s^2, or 100 gees, it would take Sonic 3000 seconds to 
<br />
reach 300,000 m/s^2 (light speed))
<br />

<br />
-I think that even Sonic would have a hard time controlling his movements at higher 
<br />
speeds
<br />

<br />

<br />
2) I think that Airforce pilots are subjected to three gees and usually don't pass out. 
<br />
Even so, it would be hard to hold on AND not black-out.  However, a rider would 
<br />
probably have some advantatges:
<br />

<br />
-From what I can tell, most furries are one-half to three-fourths the heights of most 
<br />
Humans.  This would lower their weight substantially, giving the rider less weight to 
<br />
carry during acceleration.  I believe that the muscle-to-weight ratio would not 
<br />
decreace as much.
<br />

<br />
-Most of the Knothole Freedom Fighters are probably pretty dang strong, even for their 
<br />
ages.  Besides, a rider would only have to hold on for 10 seconds.
<br />

<br />
-The reason that people black out at high gravities is because not enough blood is 
<br />
getting to their brain.  I think that smaller animals have an advantage (shorter 
<br />
distances for the blood to travel) and that furries may have different anatomies.
<br />

<br />
-Sure, Sonic can accelerate quickly WITHOUT a rider, but he might accelerate slower 
<br />
with twice his own weight.  But then again, I don't have the cartoons (sniff), so I 
<br />
haven't seen him accelerate/deaccelerate much.
<br />

<br />

<br />
3) TEN GEES?!  Um, the above arguments may give a passenger some leeway, but TEN GEES?! 
<br />
Well, Sonic would DEFINITELY have a hard time deaccelerating quickly here, so he may 
<br />
actually start slowing several minutes before the stop.  A rider would probably 
<br />
black-out quickly here, but if it was quickly enough, they might keep conciousness (or 
<br />
just die, like falling off a building).  One thing that would definitely help is if a 
<br />
gravity on Mobius is different from one of Earth's (but I doubt that).
