Well, I just picked up Sonic #35 today, and am reading the reviews on the 
<br />
list now.  He was hard to catch this month!  He sold out really faaassst
<br />
at the comic stores I usually find him (within 3 days of arrival), but
<br />
thankfully the 4th location I tried had one copy left.  I better renew
<br />
my subscription right away! :-)

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I agree with Quozl that 1 billion rings is a bit much.

<br />
Maybe if you count all the copies of Sonic games sold, times the number
<br />
of times each one has been played, times the number of rings Sonic collects
<br />
each time he runs, you might come up with a number close to 1 billion.
<br />
Maybe even a U.K. billion. (10^12 rather than 10^9 :-)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This story seemed a bit too strongly based on the games for me.
</em><br />

<br />
I rather liked the premise of &quot;Ring of Truth&quot;, it was like a glimpse
<br />
into the Mobian supernatural.  I was in suspense for the whole story, 
<br />
not knowing _what_ to expect -- as anything could happen!
<br />

<br />
It was kind of cool to see things from the early issues again,
<br />
like Dr. R's Checker Wrecker Ball (but called his Mega-Maceball this time). 
<br />
I think it bears certain similarities to the Amiga Boing Ball (from the 
<br />
first Amiga demo, Boing!  The colour scheme is different, though).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But the Manak/Koslowski art was OK...
</em><br />

<br />
Yep, it looks like Manak has been taking hints from Spaz, like interesting
<br />
viewing angles.  His artwork lends an &quot;early issue&quot; feel to this story,
<br />
which ties in very nicely with some of the fundamental developments for the
<br />
Mobian world mythos shown in this issue.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Other references from other shows: &quot;Big Bird&quot;, and &quot;hokey smokes&quot;
</em><br />

<br />
Maybe they are expressions Sonic picked up from being in two TV shows
<br />
himself? :-)  B.B. and Rocky &amp; Bullwinkle have become part of N.A. culture.
<br />
(I've been watching R&amp;B again since I noticed YTV was airing it at 4:00 AM.
<br />
Turns out I was missing half the jokes when I saw it as a kid. :-)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The quasi-King James English didn't do much for me, but I suppose it was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sort of &quot;mandatory&quot; (if not consistent: &quot;thous and yous&quot; were intermixed).
</em><br />

<br />
Yeah, it bugged me that Gallagher didn't get the grammar quite right.  Unless
<br />
it was intentional.  Since &quot;ye&quot; is plural, the 3rd Walker is addressing the
<br />
_readership_, as well as Sonic.  And I'd wager that the boon we have been
<br />
granted is the Sonic Movie.  :-)
<br />

<br />
&quot;What hidden meaning am I supposed to get from this?&quot; and &quot;Nothing is hidden
<br />
-- only unseen!&quot; could then be interpreted (for us) as &quot;This story/issue
<br />
contains some _mondo-major_ hints!&quot;.  
<br />

<br />
And then there's this SonicQuest -- it sounds like a story arc for future
<br />
issues of the Sonic comic, but could it be the Movie instead?  (How can you
<br />
tell I'm getting really hyped up about the Sonic Movie already?  :-)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Page 12:  I thought a sideways figure-eight was the symbol for infinity, not 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;   eternity, but maybe I'm splitting hairs...
</em><br />

<br />
So Sonic isn't that great at math...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Page 13:  The 3rd walker's answer reminded me of a Twilight Zone episode 
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[with a mathematician and the Devil]
<br />

<br />
Cool!  So being good at math doesn't help one much when talking with
<br />
supernatural beings.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;   But what's a &quot;triple helix&quot;?  That chain didn't look like a helix 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;     &gt;   at all to me...
</em><br />

<br />
In the panel in the middle of page 10, are we looking along the axis of 3 
<br />
chains twisted around one another?  It's hard to tell, so I just took
<br />
Sonic's word for it.  I wonder if a triple-helical DNA-like molecule,
<br />
that can encode information and triplicate itself, could really exist?
<br />

<br />
Linked rings have all sorts of magical overtones. (&quot;The Linking Ring&quot; is
<br />
even the title of a magicians' journal.)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; New editor Fred Mendez...
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
I noticed that Freddie is also the editor of _Street_Sharks_, which seems to
<br />
have replaced Sonic in 7-11's around here. :-(  (And also in the canned pasta
<br />
department of the grocery stores.)  At least it has a &quot;Sonic Checklist&quot; page.
<br />
Makes sense in light of the Street Sharks cartoon, I suppose.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rather weird Anime/video game-like representation of Sonic and Tails on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; last page...
</em><br />

<br />
That must be a _huge_ hint, about something.  Characters in Virtua Fighter are
<br />
rendered like that, so it's probably a hint about Fighting Sonic.  Characters
<br />
in computer-generated animation (like ReBoot) are also modelled in wireframe,
<br />
which looks something like this page too, so maybe the Archie Sonic team got
<br />
to see some of the work-in-progress on the Sonic Movie.
