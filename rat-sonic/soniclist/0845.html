<br />
Part 6.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was curled up into a ball, paralyzed with fear.  He was in 
<br />
Robotnik's private transport, and they were headed towards the Great 
<br />
Unknown.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik had waited until Tolouse woke up again, and then continued 
<br />
to explain his 'game'...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...The ancient foxes that played in The Hunt usually relied on 
<br />
their nose to find their prey.  Unfortunately, humans cannot smell as 
<br />
well as foxes can, and I have yet to master such technology for the 
<br />
Swat-bots.  So, just to make this as 'fair' as possible, I have decided 
<br />
on this.&quot;  He fastened a small device to Tolouse's wrist, locking it.  
<br />
&quot;This is a homing signal.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;Don't worry, dear fox, it is 
<br />
not a very powerful one.  I still have to know your general location for 
<br />
it to work.  Think of it as my sense of smell.  And...think of this,&quot; he 
<br />
said, displaying a hover-scooter, &quot;as my legs.  Those ancient foxes 
<br />
could run much faster than their poor prey, and I intend on making this 
<br />
Fox-Hunt as close to the original as possible.&quot;  Robotnik laughed 
<br />
loudly, and Tolouse's jaw dropped in grim fear.  His mind screamed, NO!!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But his voice would not work, and he could only stare at Robotnik 
<br />
in helpless, fearful silence...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse felt the vehicle slow to a stop, and then he heard Robotnik 
<br />
step out.  Soon, the door to the cargo hold slid open, and Tolouse felt 
<br />
the afternoon sun.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here we are, Tolouse.  Let the Fox-Hunt begin!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Swat-bot forced Tolouse out of the cargo hold, and he stood on 
<br />
the ground, his legs trembling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right, now.  Off you go, my dear fox.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse could only stare, his heart pounding and his mind 
<br />
hopelessly confused by panic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik glared at him.  &quot;I am giving you a head start, fox.  USE 
<br />
IT!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those last words got through, and Tolouse found himself tearing off 
<br />
into the Great Unknown, running as fast as he could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik snickered darkly, then, remembering to make this as 'fair' 
<br />
and as exciting as possible, put his robotic hand over his eyes.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One-Robotropolis, two-Robotropolis, three-Robotropolis...&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally!  Sally!  Open up!&quot;  Bookshire pounded on Sally's door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally finally opened the door, and she looked at the out-of-breath 
<br />
raccoon.  &quot;Yes, Bookshire?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think...I think I found something!&quot; he huffed.  &quot;Robotnik's 
<br />
private transport left about a half hour ago, headed towards the Great 
<br />
Unknown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;According to the transport logs, it carried Robotnik, a Swat-bot, 
<br />
and a 'nonroboticized fox'!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally's eyes flew open wide.  &quot;What?  Was it Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire shook his head, still breathing hard from running.  &quot;I 
<br />
don't know.  It didn't say.  But Sally, whoever it is, they need help!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right.  Sonic?&quot;  Sally called back into her hut, and Sonic was 
<br />
suddenly beside her in the doorway.  &quot;What's up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik's in the Great Unknown, and according to Bookshire, he's 
<br />
got somebody there!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who?  Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't know, but you must find whoever it is before Robotnik 
<br />
is... finished with them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right.  I'm outta here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!  Do you have a---?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They heard Sonic's voice say, &quot;I've got a ring.&quot;  But it might have 
<br />
been an echo, because by the time they heard the voice, Sonic was 
<br />
nowhere to be seen.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh gods, help me, HELP ME!!!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was badly out of breath, and he was blinded both by the 
<br />
spots that danced in his vision and by the tears that were soaking the 
<br />
fur of his cheeks.  Still, he kept running, knowing if he didn't, he 
<br />
would never run again.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik climbed onto the hover-scooter.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is time to hunt!&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic tore through the Great Forest, the trees passing above and 
<br />
around him in a brown and green blur.  &quot;I've got to get to the Great 
<br />
Unknown!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took out the power ring and held it above his head.  The energy 
<br />
coursed through his body, and his mind shouted, &quot;Faster!  Faster!  
<br />
FASTER!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOOM!!!
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse felt the energy draining from his body, but he forced 
<br />
himself onward.  His mind had ceased all conscious thought several 
<br />
minutes ago, but the fear was still there, instinctively telling him to 
<br />
run...run...run...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All around him spread the desolate plains of the Great Unknown.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik began flying wider and wider circles around the 
<br />
transport's location, waiting for the tracking device to start 
<br />
signalling Tolouse's whereabouts.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You cannot hide forever, my dear fox.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tracking device began beeping.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He accelerated the hover-scooter, paying close attention to the 
<br />
device.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse collapsed, his body refusing to further.  His chest heaved 
<br />
violently, his eyes were no longer working, and his body trembled from 
<br />
fear, exhaustion, and the cold, bitter winds of the Great Unknown.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why...why?
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEDGEHOG, PRIORITY ONE!  HEDGEHO---&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swat-bot was soon lying in pieces on the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not today, metal-head, I've got a fox to rescue!  Now...where is 
<br />
old 'Buttnik, anyways?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic picked a direction, and soon was off, leaving Robotnik's 
<br />
transport vehicle and the dismantled Swat-bot behind.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse picked himself up, tried to run, and collapsed again about 
<br />
20 feet from where he had been.  His mind was trying to spur him on, but 
<br />
now there was another voice as well, a less optomistic voice.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's over, Tolouse.  You tried...but it's over.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device's beeping increased in frequency.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are close, dear fox, and you are getting closer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik unlatched the laser rifle and held it one hand, his heart 
<br />
beating faster as he anticipated the climax of the Fox-Hunt.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, today is truly one of the best days I have had in a long time.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse refused to listen to that voice, and he tried to get up 
<br />
again.  His legs refused to support him.  Denying that fact, he made 
<br />
himself run, and managed to stumble forward in a combined run and crawl.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't want to die like this!  I don't want to die...
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stood on a small incline, worried.  Robotnik and whoever he 
<br />
had brought out here (It's Tolouse, I know it!  It's Tolouse!) were 
<br />
nowhere to be seen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, his eyes made out a small detail, close to the horizon.  
<br />
He took out the binoculars from his back-pack.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THERE HE IS!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly the incline was abandoned.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The device's beeping had virtually turned into a hum, and Robotnik 
<br />
began looking around the area.  Soon, his eyes found something, and he 
<br />
grinned an evil grin.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There he is.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hover-scooter changed directions and homed in on what his eyes 
<br />
were dead-set on.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked behind him, and saw Robotnik approaching.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's over, Tolouse...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No!!  Gods, please, NOOOO!!!!
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik stopped the hover-scooter and dismounted.  Slowly, 
<br />
methodically, he stepped forward, raising the laser rifle until it was 
<br />
aiming at his target.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was a pleasant hunt, dear fox.  And now, the culmination...&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh no you don't, 'Buttnik!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic didn't waste any time.  He slowed down just enough to be able 
<br />
to grab Tolouse, then, again taking out the power ring, he began putting 
<br />
as much distance between Tolouse and Robotnik as he could.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik thought his eyes had played a trick on him.  One moment, 
<br />
the fox was laying on the ground in front of him, and the next, he was 
<br />
gone!  And what was that streak of bl---?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His mind found the answer before it even completed the question, 
<br />
and soon Robotnik was turning bright red in pure, furious anger.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO!!!  YOU...BLASTED...HEDGEHOG!!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, he temporarily lost the ability to speak coherently.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was unconscious in Sonic's arms, and in his dreaming mind, 
<br />
Robotnik's rifle was still aimed at his head, frozen in time...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those eyes, those piercing, red eyes...
<br />

<br />
to be continued
