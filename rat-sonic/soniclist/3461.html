Well, something went wrong...er, RIGHT...with Archie's
<br />
distribution system and I actually found a copy of #37 on the
<br />
newsstand on June 3.  So let me post this before the list goes
<br />
bye-bye.  Consider this your usual SPOILERS alert:

#37 [Aug 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm getting tired of these covers by Spaziante...NOT!!!  Sonic
<br />
in freefall (apparently) holding Sally in his arm.  Nice design -
<br />
- call it &quot;The Mobian Pieta.&quot;  And if you don't know what I'm
<br />
talking about, get thee to a library and read up on the
<br />
sculptures of Michelangelo [the sculptor, not the turtle!].
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Day Robotropolis Fell&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Brian Thomas
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally rendezvous with Uncle Chuck in Robotropolis,
<br />
who breaks the news to them that Robotnik has predicted that an
<br />
earthquake is going to hit the city (Excuse me, Dr. Robotnik,
<br />
some gentlemen from Cal Tech have just arrived; they keep talking
<br />
about &quot;the big one&quot; so I assume they mean you...).  Robotnik's
<br />
plan is to hover over the city in a giant saucer-like craft
<br />
loaded with his SWATbots until the quake ends.  He doesn't
<br />
particularly care what happens to the worker bots (i.e.,
<br />
roboticized Mobians) but Uncle Chuck does.  Uncle Chuck's plan:
<br />
while Robotnik is hovering, they enter his HQ, reactivate the
<br />
deroboticizer (gee, that's the first I've heard of it!) and treat
<br />
as many worker bots as possible before the quake hits.  This
<br />
assumes what Uncle Chuck doesn't: that Robotnik left a
<br />
comfortable margin between takeoff and the quake.  Unable to
<br />
deroboticize the Mobians one at a time, he plans to blow up the
<br />
roboticizer by overloading it, counting on the diffusion to
<br />
deroboticize the Mobians in bulk, as it were.  Sounds to me like
<br />
the scientific equivalent of supply-side economics, but never
<br />
mind.  In the resulting blast, Uncle Chuck is NOT effected while
<br />
the rest of the worker bots are.  Uncle Chuck and DeCesare don't
<br />
bother to explain how this could have happened before the next
<br />
tremor comes down the pike.  Rotor just happens to arrive with a
<br />
transport plane, but it proves to be too small.  Sally pulls rank
<br />
and orders Uncle Chuck onto the plane -- OK, so it's not exactly
<br />
the airport scene from &quot;Casablanca.&quot;  While Sally tries to find
<br />
out from Nicole what's the best way out of Robotropolis during an
<br />
earthquake, a sizable chunk of masonry lands on top of her.  If
<br />
this weren't a comic book, she'd be a stain on the pavement; as
<br />
it is, she's unconscious and it's up to Sonic to get her out of
<br />
town.  They manage, and we eventually see Sally with her head
<br />
bandaged and her arm in a sling.  Robotnik lands and resolves to
<br />
rebuild, relying on a satellite-based force field to protect the
<br />
city during its reconstruction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll leave it to the Californians on the list as to whether
<br />
DeCesare's depiction of a quake is credible; me, I had enough
<br />
troubles with this story.  Uncle Chuck is suffering from a bad
<br />
case of logic deficiency in this one: the business with the
<br />
deroboticizer--It will be most effective if I overload it to the
<br />
point of destroying it--reminds me too much of some of the plot
<br />
problems with &quot;Steel-Belted Sally&quot; (#29).  There's no way ALL of
<br />
the roboticized Mobians could have converged on the deroboticizer
<br />
just in time for the explosion so some of them had to have been
<br />
victims of the quake, just as there's no way Sally could have
<br />
avoided becoming a blob of royal jelly after that masonry fell on
<br />
her.  Nor do we ever find out how Uncle Chuck escaped the effects
<br />
of the deroboticizer, or how Rotor was able to get a plane from
<br />
Deus Ex Machina Airlines into the city in time.  The premise of
<br />
the story was good, as was the artwork, but the more you think
<br />
about the plot the more it turns into a no-brainer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic Art: I thought Brian Thomas had drawn the eyes of the
<br />
characters in &quot;The Day Robotropolis Fell&quot; too big--Sally
<br />
especially looked as if she belonged in a black velvet painting--
<br />
until I saw Charles Kusiak's fanart.  You could drive a TRUCK
<br />
through those pupils!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie's Worst Nightmare
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story and Art: Rich Koslowski[debut]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie's first solo effort starts out with quite a premise:
<br />
What starts out as an annoying itch turns out to be a spreading
<br />
case of roboticization.  Thanks to a convenient hologram of
<br />
Robotnik to describe the plot, it turns out that Bunnie may have
<br />
been partially roboticized at one time, but a &quot;microscopic
<br />
device&quot; implant has started to finish the job.  On the verge of
<br />
total roboticization, she leaves Knothole.  After traveling all
<br />
night she falls asleep and wakes up to...The Old Dream Ending!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a pity Rich was only given 8 pages to play with; with
<br />
another 8 pages, this could have been the story it was meant to
<br />
be.  It's not that this ground hasn't been travelled before: it
<br />
has, in everything from &quot;The Amazing Colossal Man&quot; to &quot;Dr.
<br />
Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde&quot; to the remake of &quot;The Fly&quot;: what it's like
<br />
for someone to gradually lose their humanity (or in Bunnie's
<br />
case, to borrow a word from Richard Adams, her &quot;animality&quot;) while
<br />
becoming something else.  If you'll allow me, here's how it could
<br />
have played:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first Bunnie ignores the first signs of change, though
<br />
she may even have a suspicion as to what it may mean.  This
<br />
proves the saying heard in 12 Step groups: Denial ain't just a
<br />
river in Egypt!  Then the condition continues its slow,
<br />
relentless possession of her.  I think it wouldn't be too strong
<br />
to say that, from Bunnie's point of view, this gradual takeover
<br />
of her bod must feel like slow-motion rape.  An off-hand remark
<br />
from one of her friends (spoken in innocence by Tails or in
<br />
ignorance by Antoine) lets the reader know that she's not just
<br />
turning into a machine but also into one of Robotnik's minions. 
<br />
After the obligatory note scene, she starts to leave Knothole but
<br />
is intercepted by Sally who tries one last time to talk her into
<br />
staying.  After a tearful farewell, Bunnie begins to leave, then
<br />
pauses.  Sally, ever hopeful, runs over to her, only to discover
<br />
that Bunnie's transformation is complete and that she's gone over
<br />
to the Dark Side, as it were.  She now has a new set of
<br />
priorities, the first of which is: &quot;DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS.  BY
<br />
ORDER OF ROBOTNIK.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm not trying to brag, but I barely broke a sweat coming up
<br />
with this enhancement to the story line.  Yet I also couldn't
<br />
help but think of (if you'll allow me to get momentarily off-
<br />
topic) an episode of Disney's &quot;Aladdin.&quot;  In this one ep, Jasmine
<br />
begins turning into a kind of serpent creature due to a spell by
<br />
Mirage, an evil being.  She and Al journey in search of a
<br />
possible cure.  When all attempts to get at the cure are foiled
<br />
by Mirage and Jasmine's transformation into a monster is
<br />
complete, Al takes it upon himself to become the same kind of
<br />
creature as she has become, for the sake of love.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention this because while Rich does a good job of showing
<br />
what is happening--the plot certainly moves right along--there's
<br />
not much room in the story for all but the most superficial
<br />
treatment of Bunnie's emotional state.  Her emotional landscape
<br />
is painted only in the broadest strokes; this was the fatal flaw
<br />
that made Tails' change of heart at the end of &quot;Southern
<br />
Crossover&quot; [Tails miniseries #3] patently unbelievable.  Perhaps
<br />
this goes back to the question of the core audience of the comic,
<br />
but the Aladdin ep mentioned above demonstrates that it is
<br />
possible to tell such a story without dumbing it down
<br />
emotionally.  I look upon this story as eight pages of &quot;what
<br />
might have been.&quot;  As glad as I am to see Bunnie getting a solo
<br />
shot, I really believe she deserved better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: hint that the theme of a devastated
<br />
Robotropolis will continue and that Sonic will become a slow-mo. 
<br />
Plug for Knuckles #2, and a hint that Sonic will finally have a
<br />
date with the Roboticizer in #39.  Cute depiction of Joe Pepitone
<br />
as Robotnik and Fred Mendez as a computer program.  Lyrics to a
<br />
Sonic song, and a couple guesses as to the identity of
<br />
Archimedes, with an actual answer!  Almost a full page of names
<br />
of readers who have written--major headache!
<br />

<br />
Will attempts to post further synopses and FAQs to the home page
<br />
whereon the Faq File resides.  Otherwise, I may actually have to
<br />
(dare I say it?) SPEND MONEY for a computer and a subscription to
<br />
CompuServe or AOL!  My current machine at home -- an XT vanilla
<br />
clone I got as a castoff from my brother-in-law -- can no longer
<br />
read its own hard drive.  And my lunch hour at work is just
<br />
about...
<br />
