<br />
Subject: Thanks you's to many people
<br />

<br />
Hello, everybody. Since the list will be closing in a few short days, I'd
<br />
like to thank certain people who have really made a lasting impact on my
<br />
appreciation of Sonic. I'm taking advantage of this opportunity now, before
<br />
I allow it to slip through my fingers forever. (Listed in no particular order.) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
To John Johnston:
<br />
The Sonic Code is cool! Need I say more? ;)
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Ron Bauerle:
<br />
Thanks for making copies of the saturday morning shows for me! I'm not an
<br />
early riser, so USA is OUT... ;)
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Thad Boyd:
<br />
Need I explain? Without you, I never would have gotten into Sonic at all,
<br />
and wouldn't have been a part of this list. I'm really glad that I got to
<br />
know you. It's been about 5 years, hasn't it? (Ah, the days when 2400 baud
<br />
was state of the art...) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Joe Delacroix:
<br />
Thanks for introducing me to Sociopolitical Ramifications! Lots of fun, lots
<br />
of new people. (Keep writing those fan-fics!)
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Ken Penders:
<br />
Glad to have you on the list, Ken! Your insight and explanations of why
<br />
things are the way they are has been most valuable. It's helped my
<br />
understanding of the comic book industry, as well as my appreciation for the
<br />
Sonic books in general. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Dan Drazen:
<br />
I've always enjoyed your fan-fic, and have looked forward to seeing the &quot;For
<br />
FAQ file (Spoilers)&quot; subject line on a monthly basis. :)
<br />

<br />

<br />
To Eric Goodwin: 
<br />
Looking forward to a sequel!
<br />

<br />

<br />
To David Pistone, and all other fan-fic authors:
<br />
Thank you, all of you. You've provided me with HOURS of enjoyment. Keep it up!
<br />

<br />

<br />
The following people are all contributors to the Sonic IRC sessions in one
<br />
form or another, among other things.
<br />

<br />
To Commander Sonic Data:
<br />
Thanks very much for all of your offers of assistance! 
<br />

<br />
To Dennis Hurst:
<br />
Thanks again for the server listing!
<br />

<br />
To Doug LoConti:
<br />
Thanks for helping to set up a new bot to make all of our lives easier on
<br />
EFNet! You do good work as an op, as well. (Especially when troublemakers
<br />
have access to 4 different Internet accounts...) :)
<br />

<br />
To Jason Shank and Chris Flinn:
<br />
Thanks for helping me run #sonic! It would be a major headache without you.
<br />

<br />
To everyone who visits #sonic:
<br />
Thank you! Bring friends! 
<br />

<br />

<br />
And, finally, a BIG thanks to Ratman.
<br />
For hosting the list, for hosting the IRC bot, for hosting the IRC pages,
<br />
for having such a cool file archive, and other things.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
In case I don't have the opportunity to talk to all of you in the future,
<br />
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELVES! I'm glad to have been a part of the list, and I'm
<br />
very glad to have gotten to know all of you.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Bidding a very fond farewell to all...
<br />

<br />

<br />
