The Seminar

written by Holl-B Kraft
<br />

<br />
I'd just like to tell everyone that I hope they like my story. This is really 
<br />
hard to do, especially considering that I'm only a Sophomore in high school.
<br />
I'd also like to say that this contains a little romance, but not from the 
<br />
individual you may be thinking of.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was waiting by the Power Ring pool with Sally. A new mission 
<br />
had come up, and this time, it didn't involve Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Freedom Fighters seminar coming up north of the Great 
<br />
Forest, and they were almost ready to go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone was leaving Knothole to attend this seminar. What Sally and 
<br />
the other Freedom Fighter groups were planning on, was building an 
<br />
underground system between all of the Villages, providing easy transport and 
<br />
shipment of supplies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay Sonic, how many power rings do we have?&quot; Sally wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thirty.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good. That should give us enough power for weeks. Ready to go?&quot; 
<br />
Sally smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yup. Let's go gather everyone up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally  went back to Knothole to help with the final 
<br />
preparations.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Boy, I sure hope this works,&quot; sighed Dulcy, &quot;My back is going to 
<br />
kill me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy was loaded with all the supplies on her back, and the rest was 
<br />
being carried in the cruiser.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie helped as much as she could with her robotic strength. At the 
<br />
seminar, there was going to be a lecture on de-roboticization, and she was 
<br />
definitely going to that. As was Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails had packed up all of his sneakers, socks, and gloves, as did 
<br />
his mentor, Sonic. He was going to a lecture for the newer Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is going to be so much fun, isn't it Sonic?&quot; Tails smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Remember Tails, this seminar isn't just for fun. We need to learn 
<br />
while we're there too!&quot; Sonic reminded the bouncy little fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay Sonic.&quot; he replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gathered everyone up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Freedom Fighters, and Freedom Fighters-to-be, this is going to be 
<br />
one of the most important things that you do in your entire lifetime. 
<br />
Robotnik may be gone, but we still need to stay fit and alert. Sonic and I 
<br />
have tried our best to find as many Roboticized individuals as possible. With 
<br />
the help of Sir Charles Hedgehog, we've been able to bring them out of the 
<br />
trance and let them make their own decisions.&quot; Sally stepped off to the side 
<br />
and brought out a Roboticized mouse. Her eyes were red, yet she was able to 
<br />
have her own will. She stepped out into the crowd.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is Tabitha,&quot; said Sally, &quot;She's the first person after Uncle 
<br />
Chuck to have been brought to her senses. So far, we've been able to restore 
<br />
thirty Roboticized individuals back to their senses.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knothole Freedom Fighters took this time to start cheering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as everyone had settled down, Tabitha spoke up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've been Roboticized for five years now. When I was ten, I went on 
<br />
mission with some of the southern Freedom Fighters only to be captured by 
<br />
Robotnik. The first mission I went on was my last, but let me tell you, I've 
<br />
been wanting to destroy that goon ever since I was four! FREEDOM FIGHTERS 
<br />
FOREVER!!&quot; she concluded. The crowd began to cheer more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now everyone, it's very important that you check in with the group 
<br />
you've been assigned. When you hook up with your group, you will undergo a 
<br />
vigorous training session. After this has been completed, you will then go to 
<br />
your lectures. Now, are we ready?&quot; Sally shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YEAH!&quot; came her reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then here we go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lupe! It's great to see you again!&quot; smiled Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And you as well.&quot; the gray wolf smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've never seen so many Freedom Fighters in all my life!&quot; Sally 
<br />
exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, it is wonderful.&quot; Lupe replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly Bunnie ran up to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You wanted to talk to me, Sally-girl?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes Bunnie, I did. Have you seen Rotor? I need his help. We're 
<br />
building a tunneling machine and I need him.&quot; Sally explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmm...I haven't seen him all day! Where in the world did he get off 
<br />
to, you suppose?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I saw him with Sonic.&quot; said Lupe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know where they were going?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm really not sure, but I think they went into the forest for a 
<br />
walk.&quot; the wolf explained.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So Rote, what's up?&quot; Sonic asked his friend as they walked a trail.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know, to tell you the truth. Although....ah.......never mind
<br />
... forget  I mentioned it.&quot; Rotor said uneasily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stopped dead in his tracks. &quot;Rotor! You know you can tell me 
<br />
anything. Other than Tails and Uncle Chuck, we're the only sane guys here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what about Antoine?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I said 'sane' Rotor, not 'insane'. Now really, what's up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay. Well, the thing is..........I'm very lonely.........&quot; Rotor 
<br />
whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lonely?&quot; Sonic repeated, looking confused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, lonely. My family's been Roboticized and I just feel left out. 
<br />
Now that my workshop is gone, I feel even worse...d- do you know what's wrong 
<br />
with me?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know exactly how you feel Rotor. You've gotta understand, I've had 
<br />
to live with out my uncle for eleven years. Uncle Chuck is the only family 
<br />
I've got. Don't worry about it. You wanna know why? We're your family Rotor, 
<br />
and we care about cha a lot! We'll find your folks Rotor. Someday.&quot; Sonic 
<br />
smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just one more question, bud. Why did this come up all of a sudden?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh...today's my parent's anniversary.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic didn't reply.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd like to welcome all of you new Freedom Fighters to this lecture. 
<br />
First order of business is the training session!&quot; declared Bunnie, as she 
<br />
paced the stage. Sally then stood up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you know, Robotnik is gone, and that means the battle is over 
<br />
right?...Wrong. We need to rise above ourselves and begin to exceed the 
<br />
limits of advanced civilization. We, as Freedom Fighters, have the power to 
<br />
prepare for any situation.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now we're not saying that Robotnik will ever be back,&quot; continued 
<br />
Uncle Chuck, &quot;but we are saying that we need to keep in shape.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, in case we ever get attacked by anyone, we'll be up to it! Are 
<br />
we ready?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd cheered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good! Now, if you are a new Freedom Fighter, go visit...&quot; she 
<br />
trailed off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor stood behind the stage by himself. No one saw him except 
<br />
Bunnie. She quietly left the stage to see what was wrong.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hiya sugar.&quot; she smiled as she approached him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello Bunnie.&quot; he replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, now, Rotor, hon, what the hoo-haw is goin on here? You've been 
<br />
disappearing constantly, and we can't even find you! Now, sugar, you know 
<br />
you can tell me anything. I'm all ears.&quot; Bunnie giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor cracked a tiny smile. &quot;Alright, here goes.&quot; He then proceeded 
<br />
to tell Bunnie about how lonely he was and how he was depressed. Bunnie sat 
<br />
there and listened to every word. When he was finished, Rotor let out a big 
<br />
sigh.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, Rotor, you should've told us! It ain't good when you hide your 
<br />
feelin's!&quot; Bunnie exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Bunnie heard Dulcy calling her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've gotta go, sugar. I hope you feel better.&quot; Bunnie then got up, 
<br />
pecked Rotor on the cheek, and walked away slowly.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where were you Bunnie?&quot; asked Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was talkin to Rotor, he's havin some problems.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh.&quot; was all Dulcy said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the silence was broken, it was because of Bunnie, &quot;Whad y'all 
<br />
need me for, Dulcy-girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rosie's cooked up some lunch. Wanna get Rotor?&quot; Dulcy asked politely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, let him be alone for awhile. He needs to think.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, in the destroyed Robotropolis, Snively began to gather up 
<br />
his newest patrol of Swat-bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no one in particular, he said, &quot;This will be the best attack ever 
<br />
planned!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to a Swat-bot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is the ship ready?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ready, sir.&quot; it droned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEEEEEE-YAH!&quot; cried Tails as he demonstrated his Kung-Fu to his 
<br />
friends.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow! That was neat Tails!&quot; said a little skunk named Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you. Bunnie's been teaching me a lot more lately. I almost got 
<br />
my white sash!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little skunk walked over and talked to him face-to-face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're cute.&quot; was all she said. Nina then turned around and walked 
<br />
back to the crowd of eight, nine, and ten-year-olds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails just stood there, his mouth hung open.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone shouted from the crowd. &quot;Do a flying kick again, Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, yeah...flying kick...&quot; he stuttered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong, Tails? Are you tired?&quot; asked Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No...it's just-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was cut off by Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hiya T2! Watcha up to?&quot; Sonic questioned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was showing us some of his Kung-Fu, Sonic, sir.&quot; Nina said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir? Now, Nina! Call me Sonic.&quot; he grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I, uh, ohhhh....&quot; Tails suddenly fainted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa! Tails! What's wrong?&quot; Sonic gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think he's just a little tired, Sonic.&quot; grinned the little skunk.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie and Sally sat in their tent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have you talked to Rotor yet, Sally-girl?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why no, what's wrong?&quot; Sally wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie then related the story to the princess.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Poor Rotor.&quot; Sally sighed as she brushed away a stray tear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the matter, sugar?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I remember the times with my father, and-&quot; Sally began to cry 
<br />
on Bunnie's shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't cry Sally,&quot; said Bunnie, &quot;you'll rust my arm!&quot; Bunnie giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally laughed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what, Bunnie? I'm gonna go over to Rotor and tell him how 
<br />
much I'm hurting. I'll tell him he's not alone. In fact,&quot; Sally slid off the 
<br />
bed and started to shuffle through her pack, &quot;I'll make him some hot 
<br />
chocolate.&quot; she said, showing Bunnie the packet of cocoa.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's good, Sally-girl. You are the sweetest friend I've got.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails slowly began to awaken.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wh- where am I?&quot; he whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're back in our tent, big guy. I heard about what Nina said. Are 
<br />
you all-right?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah...I guess so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya know, your ol Aunt Sal used to do that to me when I was your 
<br />
age.&quot; Sonic grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Tails wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing. She was just flirting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Flirting? What's that?&quot; Tails asked as he propped himself up on his 
<br />
cot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a kinda hint from a girl that she likes you.&quot; Sonic informed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;EWWW! That's disgusting.&quot; Tails said, gagging.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I know, it's pretty harsh. You'll learn to like it someday, 
<br />
though.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not me, Son. I'll NEVER like that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what I said Tails, and now I got Sal!&quot; Sonic replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I don't like Nina.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have you even tried to start a conversation with her?&quot; Sonic quipped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...um.....no....&quot; Tails quieted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then how do you know you don't like her?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...I just don't! She's a girl!&quot; Tails exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's a reason?&quot; Sonic smiled. He liked what was happening. What 
<br />
was happening to Tails, had once happened to him when he was ten.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess not.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, Tails. I'll be honest with ya. Nina's a nice girl. She 
<br />
obviously thinks you're good looking from all that training you're doing. 
<br />
I don't she one reason why she was silly to have said what she did.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot; Tails asked his mentor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Serious.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay...,&quot; Tails said in a very low voice, &quot;I guess I can talk to her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's my pal! Now come on, we need some help with the Tunneler.&quot; 
<br />
replied Sonic. He then helped the fox up and took him outside.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor?&quot; Sally called into the walrus's tent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah?&quot; came a reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I brought some hot chocolate. Do you want some?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot; answered Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I came to talk for awhile,&quot; said Sally, &quot;about my father.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your father?&quot; Rotor said in disbelief.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes. I came to tell you that you're not alone. I hadn't seen my 
<br />
father for over eleven years. After I went in the void, I found out that I 
<br />
can never be with him again. You are fortunate Rotor. You can find your 
<br />
parents, and when you do, you can have some chance of de-roboticizing them. 
<br />
I, on the other hand, will never see my daddy again.&quot; Sally quietly sipped 
<br />
her hot chocolate as a tear slowly ran down her cheek.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Sally. I'm really sorry. I never realized...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor,  I'm not saying that your mourning in vain, but what I am 
<br />
saying is, appreciate the family you have. We're always here, Rotor. Always.&quot; 
<br />
and with that, Sally left the tent.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Clear out everyone!&quot; shouted Bunnie as Dulcy began her landing lessons.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy suddenly took to air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is great! I can actually feel a perfect landing coming up.&quot; 
<br />
Dulcy smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie had her fingers crossed. &quot;Good luck, sugar-dragon!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy circled over the meadow a few times before she went in to land. 
<br />
When she did, it wasn't very pretty. She ended up falling on her stomach and 
<br />
scraping her chin on the ground. Bunnie ran over to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you all right, Dulcy?&quot; she panted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OOOOOoooooh....thanks ma.......I'm fine........&quot; she warbled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wanna try it again?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy cleared her head by shaking it side-to-side. &quot;No...I think I'll 
<br />
work on it later. It's starting to hurt!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina sat by the lake with her friends. Tails came up to her and sat 
<br />
next to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi.&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nina's friends got up and left, sensing that they wanted to talk 
<br />
privately.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi Tails. I'm sorry.&quot; Nina said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;For what?&quot; Tails wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; the little skunk slumped, &quot;I made you faint, and I probably 
<br />
embarrassed you in front of everyone!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wasn't embarrassed, just shocked.&quot; Tails told her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm glad, because I meant what I said.&quot; blushed Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails became nervous. &quot;Um, Nina, that's what I wanted to talk about.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I think you're very nice and everything, but...&quot; Tails 
<br />
suddenly began to stammer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay Tails, I know what you want to say.&quot; smiled Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yup. Don't worry, I understand. That's what all guys are like.&quot; Nina 
<br />
then proceeded to kiss Tails on the cheek. &quot;Now, I was wondering, can you 
<br />
teach me to fly with my tail?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails just fainted.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon Sal, I'm bored!&quot; cried Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're not going back to Robotropolis. Or what's left of it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Sal, I wanna go check to see if there are any others who are 
<br />
still roboticized.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No. Sonic, we destroyed everything. Nothing is left there!&quot; Sally 
<br />
exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, Sal, it's just that I am so bored without ol Melonhead chasin 
<br />
my tail!&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, we've got a seminar going here. We can't just leave! I said 
<br />
no and that's final! Royal order!&quot; Sally shouted at the hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sighed and left the tent.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How many Swat-bots do we have totaled?&quot; demanded Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Approximately 500, sir.&quot; droned the Tech-bot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How many Worker-bots?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Eleven hundred sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you have any idea as onto how long it will take to build up the 
<br />
army that we once originally had?&quot; Snively wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Completion will probably take place this fall, sir.&quot; the bot reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Try to increase production. We must have as much as a chance as we 
<br />
did before.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes sir.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Chuck had already tried out the tunneler finding that it didn't 
<br />
work. What the problem was, was that there were too many existing tunnels 
<br />
from the Doomsday pods. The only choice was to follow up throughout those 
<br />
already existing tunnels, and to try to find connections between villages. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck went down into the ground with Tabitha and a couple other 
<br />
Roboticized individuals, who were prized for their unique night vision.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They proceeded down the tunnels for an hour before stopping. Uncle C
<br />
huck insisted that the band stop because her was almost sure he heard 
<br />
something. He called for Tabitha to come and confirm his suspicions, since 
<br />
she had extremely sensitive hearing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I do hear something, Sir Charles. It's very muffled though.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good girl, Tabby. Now do you think you could make it out if we got 
<br />
closer?&quot; wondered Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know. I'm pretty sure it's nothing though.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're probably right. We're probably very near to the hot springs.&quot; 
<br />
sighed Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's go to the left, Sir Charles.&quot; said a raccoon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lead on, Alvin.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did the Freedom Fighters know, the sound that Uncle Chuck had 
<br />
heard was the working of bots, trying to build up a wall from the main tunnel 
<br />
at Robotropolis, therefore making it impossible for anyone to crawl through 
<br />
and sabotage.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that day, Uncle Chuck's squad made it to the surface. They had 
<br />
found that they had emerged in the meadow near Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We did it!&quot; smiled Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They then started making their way back through the tunnels placing 
<br />
more markers and light systems to show where they had been.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group made it back to the seminar by nightfall.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, did you guys make it?&quot; Sally asked anxiously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep! We marked the tunnels and lighted them too.&quot; replied Tabitha.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alright! Good job you guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what, Sally?&quot; asked Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, we start sending supplies and build up our forces. I'm sure 
<br />
Dulcy will be glad to hear this. Now we don't need her to fly the supplies 
<br />
in!&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I guess we'd better get to bed. We have to pack up and go home 
<br />
tomorrow.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See ya tomorrow.&quot; said Tabitha.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;G'night.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Knothole, Sonic was helping Sally unpack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What...what if Robotnik isn't gone?...What if he...he made an 
<br />
identical robot of himself to fool us...&quot; Sonic stammered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic! That's absurd!&quot; Sally exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I guess...but you never know...&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We destroyed him!&quot; Sally informed him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yeah? Then why wasn't Snively with him?&quot; Sonic shot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He must have been in the Death Egg when we destroyed it. Either 
<br />
that, or he was in the ship, we just didn't see him. Either way, he's gone, 
<br />
and so is ChromeDome himself!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe you're right.&quot; Sonic caved in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Tails walked in, holding Nina's hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well hello Tails, hi Nina.&quot; Sally said in a pleasant voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi Aunt Sally! Hi Sonic!&quot; said Tails with a smile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi Princess Sally, hello Sonic.&quot; piped in Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey Tails, what's up?&quot; asked the blue hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Um, well, I just wanted to ask if I can take Nina with me to our 
<br />
Secret Place.&quot; Tails asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our Secret Place?! That's only for the two of us!&quot; exclaimed Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't mean ours Sonic,&quot; Tails smiled, &quot;I meant ours.&quot; he said, 
<br />
motioning to Nina.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally exchanged surprised glances.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally broke out of her confusion to ask, &quot;Is it in the Great Forest?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Aunt Sally. It is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay. You can go.&quot; Sally smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon Nina!&quot; barked Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay! Bye Sonic! Goodbye Princess Sally!&quot; said Nina, as Tails 
<br />
grabbed her hand and led her out of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as they were out of hearing distance, Sonic spoke up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like Tails is hooked too!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Too?&quot; said Sally suspiciously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah!&quot; Sonic smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Sonic Hedgehog,&quot; said Sally, &quot;I think we better go unpack 
<br />
Tails things while he's gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right. Let's go.&quot; Sonic replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they walked out, Sonic put his arm around Sally.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How were your seminars, Rotor?&quot; asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good! I learned some new things on androids. I'll need 'em since 
<br />
that mess up on Ro-Becca.&quot; he smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you feeling any better, sugar?&quot; Bunnie asked with sincerity
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah. Sally really woke me up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I'm glad you're all right.&quot; Bunnie paused, &quot;Wanna come over to 
<br />
my place for some tea?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...sure...I guess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh good! I've been wantin' to try out Antoine's cookbook. It's got a 
<br />
whole section devoted to teas! C'mon, sugar.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor got up and followed Bunnie to her hut, where she then put on a 
<br />
kettle of water. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tea was ready, Bunnie and Rotor sat down and had a long 
<br />
serious chat about their childhoods, and how badly they missed their 
<br />
families. It was late when they finally finished.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks for the talk, Rotor. I've been wanting to get the same things 
<br />
off of my lil' ol' mind.&quot; Bunnie said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anytime...well, goodnight, Bunnie.&quot; said Rotor
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Goodnight, sugar.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE END!  ;)
<br />
