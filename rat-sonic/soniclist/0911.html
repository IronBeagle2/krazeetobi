Not me anymore.  I got a BS degree in audio technology in 1991 at Middle 
<br />
Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro (~30mi SE of Nashville).
<br />

<br />
I've not done an actual count, but I think there are quite a few .edu 
<br />
addresses in the subscriber database.  That and .com are probably the 
<br />
most prevalent.

Okay, okay... I've had this e-mail sitting in my mailbox for quite some time 
<br />
now, so I'd better respond to it... Work has been keeping me busy lately.

<br />
Ummm... I don't know.  The Style Guide is available through our licensing 
<br />
department, but it's not cheap (I've heard $100).  I suppose I could run it 
<br />
through a photocopier for you guys, but the licensing group wouldn't like 
<br />
that...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; Hope you enjoyed it!  I'll post info on Robotnik and Tails in a few days.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Oooh, I wanna see!  I wanna see!  Tails is so happy fun, and Mr. R is

<br />
Well, I've been kinda busy lately... Sorry.  I'm trying to get Comix Zone (a 
<br />
new interactive comic book fighting game) released.
<br />

<br />
Now where did I put that info on Tails... I'm going to have to look for it. 
<br />
&nbsp;Hopefully soon... Grrrr...  :)
<br />

<br />
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG BUBBLE GUM (in a small Game Gear shaped container)
<br />

<br />
The packaging on this is VERY much like a miniature game gear (cross-
<br />
pad on the left, two buttons on right and START button above those
<br />
two).  Inside, it contains FIVE large (2.5&quot; x 1.5&quot;) rectangle soft
<br />
bubblegum pieces and FIVE Sonic Game Gear game trading cards.  They
<br />
seem to go for $0.99 everywhere I've bought them.

<br />
I have to agree here, I never did care for Sonic's personality. He's the 
<br />
'Star' or 'Hero' in name only. What does he have going for him? Just 
<br />
Speed and a lot of luck. Sally has all the leadership skills and the 
<br />
brains (for plot reasons the TV show would give Sonic brief flashes of 
<br />
insight, but they never really 'fit' Sonic)
<br />

<br />
What the problem is, Sonic's is too limited by the 'personality' that 
<br />
SEGA created for the video game. Fast, blue, who 'stretched' his 
<br />
personality by tapping his shoe waiting for the player to get back from 
<br />
the bathroom! (that by the way was the big breakthrough that made Sonic 
<br />
more of a personality than his true arch enemy..Mario!)
<br />

<br />
Now Sally and St. John are more interesting because they were created for 
<br />
'plot' not game play. Even Tails is more interesting because he was more 
<br />
flexable (his traits from Sonic 2 being more 'amiable' and flexable, of
<br />
course Tails could never become the 'classic' hero, at least without a lot 
<br />
of growing up, but he can fit into a number of sidekick roles)
<br />

<br />
Also Sally and St. John both LOOK a lot cuter than Sonic, fur is so 
<br />
much nicer than 'glumby cartoon quills' ...Way past! :-)

<br />
Following up the same way, since I havwe been involved here... :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I was under the impression that Sally was a ground squirrel, who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;do not need the long, bushy tails of their tree dwelling cousins

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; there's variation in ground squirrels or some junk...
</em><br />

<br />
There are about half-a-dozen to a dozen species of ground squirrels, most 
<br />
of which *do not* have prominent tails. Some of them have only stubs for 
<br />
tails, hence it's mistaken to think chipmunks are in the squirrel family, 
<br />
even though they're similar. My reference is an Audubon (sp?) Society 
<br />
guide to NA mammals....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;    By the way.. the concept of Antoine 'giving' his tail to Tails is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev4">&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;    just plain goofy.  I don't buy it one bit :)

</em><br />

<br />
The Warner Siblings.... :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;And as a side note...after finishing the Sally comic, I must say I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;rooting for St. John and Sally.  He's much better for her than Sonic,

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure Quozl will agree that St. John's better looking too :^)
</em><br />

<br />
Sonic is a misunderstood character, but oddly enough, there isn't much 
<br />
known WRT the relationship between St.John and Sally, ie: *how* they fell 
<br />
in love-- The comic only gives that hint right at the end with the kiss 
<br />
and the diary note... And that's it.
<br />

....Quozl!

This is something I've had to face in developing my own fanfic (I've got
<br />
a couple-three more stories in development).  Sonic's been tough to
<br />
write for, since it's hard to get past the argot and the attitude.
<br />
Tough, but not impossible.  Hope the results speak for themselves one of
<br />
these days.  In one story (possible hint of a spoiler here) he runs into
<br />
an old friend from pre-Robotnik days, and events test that friendship.
<br />
But I'll say no more.
<br />

<br />
We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Does anyone know the name of the squirrel attacked by &quot;Sally&quot; in the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;beginning of the story?
</em><br />

<br />
No, but she is kind of cute (no Buttermilk Slappy though...)
<br />

<br />
This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:
<br />

<br />
When Hedgehogs Collide!
<br />

<br />
written by Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders
<br />
Pencils by Dave Manak (Chapters 1 and 2) and Art  Mawhinney (Chapters 3 and 4)
<br />
Inks by Harvo (??)    (Chapters 1 and 2) and Rich Koslowski (Chapters 3 and 4)
<br />

<br />
The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
<br />
various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a 
<br />
medieval village - various vendors selling stuff in the &quot;town square&quot;, etc.
<br />
Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
<br />
run around in motorized vehicles?)
<br />

<br />
Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
<br />
alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
<br />
Robotnik is a &quot;kindly ol'... grade-A wimp!&quot;, and the SWATbots do all the 
<br />
work, so life is boring (at least for bad guys like these).  So they 
<br />
decided for kicks to come to &quot;our dimension&quot; (rather handy how they can hop 
<br />
on the &quot;cosmic interstate&quot; whenever they want) and make trouble for our 
<br />
heroes.  Drooling fanboys should note that this chapter has a few shots of 
<br />
the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
<br />
stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)
<br />

<br />
Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
<br />
Antoine come through Rotor's &quot;Timespace Matter Projector&quot; (TM) back from 
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot;, but couldn't &quot;pierce the ZONE OF SILENCE where Robotnik 
<br />
exiled Sally's dad KING ACORN!&quot;  ????  Nice exchange between Sonic and 
<br />
Nicole here...
<br />

<br />
Sally almost catches them talking about their attempt, and there's a brief 
<br />
reference to the Princess Sally Miniseries story.  However, before either 
<br />
can talk about (or evade :^)) these topics, the angry villagers attack them 
<br />
thinking they're the bad guys.  Our heroes escape to figure out what to do...
<br />
(Note: Tails flies off with Antoine, Sally hitches a ride with Sonic, and 
<br />
Rotor flies off with a jetpack.)
<br />

<br />
The &quot;Sonic art&quot; pinup is nothing special.
<br />

<br />
Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
<br />
&quot;leathers&quot;; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
<br />
a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
<br />
place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  
<br />

<br />
The imposters decide to attack a band of &quot;poor innocent gypsies&quot; who, 
<br />
natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
<br />
bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
<br />
(paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
<br />
matched, so Sally yells &quot;Change partners!&quot; and this does the job.
<br />

<br />
The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic &quot;game over - you lose!&quot; 
<br />
and he gets the reply: &quot;Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
<br />
came for!  A fight!&quot;  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
<br />
with himself, and he replies &quot;Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic &amp; 
<br />
Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
<br />
the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
<br />
more enthused about either...
<br />

<br />
Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
<br />
Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
<br />
(actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
<br />
was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
<br />
There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
<br />
one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)
<br />

<br />
That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;This question pertains to Archie Comics Sonic issue #24 and would be

<br />
Cute, yes, but a bit on the young side for me- I think she's about 12 here..
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This gives me an excuse to offer my review of this issue:
</em><br />

<br />
And my um, comments thereof follows.... Be prepared: I'm not kind today!

</em><br />

<br />
In general, not very well drawn in alot of spots, though there were some 
<br />
good points, though... Writing could've been better, too. Nowhere *near* 
<br />
the calibre of work put into the Princess Sally miniseries, 
<br />
unfortunately! :(
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The story opens with Sonic, Sally, Antoine, and Tails all mistreating 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various members of Knothole (which is somewhat oddly shown as kind of a

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also, Antoine's mischief involves a sports car - since when does anybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; run around in motorized vehicles?)
</em><br />

<br />
I was rather bothered by these two factors, myself, considering (a) 
<br />
they're in our future, and (b) Knothole has always been, in the DiC 
<br />
cartoons (my exposure, natch), to be a makeshift rebel compound, and not 
<br />
a self-contained community.... Considering Archie is taking up the reigns 
<br />
in presenting the Sonic universe after the cancellation of the DiC 
<br />
cartoons, and the big draw is *coming* from the DiC SatAM audience, it's 
<br />
disconcerting at best....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chapter 2 reveals that these 4 are really the evil imposters from the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alternate universe seen previously in issues 11 and 19.  Apparently 
</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the evil Sally in leather...  Also, that Tails and Rotor have facial 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; stubble; I didn't know furries could do that :^)
</em><br />

<br />
Chapter 2 was an overall improvement after Ch. 1- In the beginning, at 
<br />
least. There *are* certain .fandom-esque notes to be made here, 
<br />
particularly of Sally (as mentioned) and of course, Sonic's desk! Turning 
<br />
the scene upside-down and read from left to right we have:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic      Sonic      Sonic      Sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+          +          +          +
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally      Bunnie     Nicole     Sonic
<br />

<br />
The first, obviously was no surprise and the second caught me off-guard, 
<br />
not expecting seeing something I suspected being confirmed (yeah, I know; 
<br />
alternate world, but there are parallels between the two Sonics, 
<br />
including interests and egos!); however, I was *totally* surprised by the 
<br />
latter two, and had me ROTFLing! :) (But then again, Sonic *does* love 
<br />
himself!- It's Nicole that caught me off-guard here! :) )
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Chapter 3 begins with a major continuity glitch as Sonic, Tails, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Antoine come through Rotor's &quot;Timespace Matter Projector&quot; (TM) back from

</em><br />

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nicole here...
</em><br />

<br />
Mediocre chapter here.....
<br />

<br />
[....]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The &quot;Sonic art&quot; pinup is nothing special.
</em><br />

<br />
Agreed.....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part 4 has the imposters attack again, but this time wearing their 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;leathers&quot;; the villagers _still_ don't get it...  The first panel shows 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a rabbit mother and her son running away from them.  This is as good a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; place as any to note that Bunnie doesn't appear in this issue :^(  
</em><br />

<br />
This chapter had some considerable improvement overall, notably in the 
<br />
art, notably in this splash page... And yes, Bunnie is conspicuous by her 
<br />
absense in this comic. I think it's probably because the issue is a 
<br />
regression to the style of the *syndicated* DiC cartoon, which the comic 
<br />
series was initially based on..
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The imposters decide to attack a band of &quot;poor innocent gypsies&quot; who, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; natch, are our heroes in disguise.  We get to see how handy Sally is with a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bow and arrow, then your basic fight scene as everybody goes hand-to-hand
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (paw-to-paw?) with their counterparts.  However, they are too evenly 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; matched, so Sally yells &quot;Change partners!&quot; and this does the job.
</em><br />

<br />
Third .fandom-esque note: Sally *in* a skirt- Then she takes the skirt off!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The story ends with our Sonic telling evil Sonic &quot;game over - you lose!&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and he gets the reply: &quot;Shows how much YOU know, pretty boy!  I got what I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came for!  A fight!&quot;  and then he faints.  Sally asks Sonic how he can live 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with himself, and he replies &quot;Confidentially, Princess, it ain't easy!&quot;
</em><br />

<br />
The fight was so-so; the ending was a typical Sonic statement, though it 
<br />
would've been something he would've been more upbeat about...
<br />

<br />
Frankly, I didn't care much for the story. OK, I've been spoiled rotten 
<br />
by the SatAM DiC cartoon, and the Princess Sally miniseries, and most of 
<br />
the fanfic written *so far* has been better than *this*.... Come on, 
<br />
fellas! I'd rather have the quality of the Princess Sally miniseries over 
<br />
*this!* :(
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The announcements section on the letters page has a plug for the Sonic &amp; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knuckles comic, plus the fact that the 25th issue will be an adaptation of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the CD Game featuring Mecha Sonic!!  Covers for both are shown; with I was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; more enthused about either...
</em><br />

<br />
Same here....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Nothing special in the fan letters, but the reply to one notes that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails mini-series will be on sale next fall.  (Do they mean _this_ fall?)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (actually, it was probably _last_ fall when they wrote that, so this fall 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; was really last fall's next fall - have I lost everybody yet?  :^)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; There was a nice exchange between Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck along that line 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one time - I wish I had a transcription of it.)
</em><br />

<br />
&quot;Ah-hah! Pronoun trouble!&quot; :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's it; I hope this was worth the half-hour it took me...
</em><br />

<br />
That's okay- I just went through 1-1/2 Art Of Noice CDs typing this 
<br />
reply.... That's an hour, mind you..... (OK, so I'm slow... Nothing new 
<br />
about *that*....)
<br />

<br />
.....Quozl!
