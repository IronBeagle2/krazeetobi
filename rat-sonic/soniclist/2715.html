<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It was said a while back on the list something about sega was releasing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a Sonic CD game for the PC. That was a long time ago I don't remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the exact details. I asked around a bit again recently and noone at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stores seems to know anything about it. Does anyone have any further
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;information about this?
</em><br />

<br />
(trying to keep with the list's fandom theme, Mighty answers hastily...)
<br />
There was a game.  It was released for the PC, but I don't think it was
<br />
SUPPOSED TO be released, (or at least not in the USA).  It is a replica of
<br />
Sonic CD-complete with animations, and even MORE bonus stuff than the
<br />
orrigional!  YOu will, however, not be able to BUY this title, (as it
<br />
doesn't officially &quot;exsisT&quot;,) HOWEVER after a few MONTHS (literally)
<br />
searching some &quot;special&quot; FTP sites, I was able to uncover it-all 17 disks of
<br />
it.  An excellent game, but unfortunately, the way SOA programs, you need an
<br />
INTEL Pentium 66Mhz or BETTER with 8MB of RAM to run it.  So, have fun with
<br />
that one!  :)  Anyways, if anyone is interested in this game personally,
<br />
e-mail me.  Keep in mind the system specifications, or don't bother
<br />
e-mailing me, cuz it won't run.  Say I had a DX4 and thought I'd be cute and
<br />
DL it?  Uh-huh... it's not that it runs SLOW or takes a while to LOAD, it
<br />
just plain ol' WON'T RUN. :)  Well, anyhow, to answer the question, other
<br />
than all the bonus stuff, it's a replica of SONIC CD.  And all the cool
<br />
aVI's come with it, crystal clear, full screen, and SMALL in size.  
<br />

<br />
Welp, that's it folks! 
<br />

<br />
Oh, to keep the &quot;on-topic&quot; aspect someone a while ago asked what Sally was?
<br />
I always thought she was a mix between a ground squirel and a fox.  (I guess
<br />
her parents were different... we never saw her Mom, but her Dad had a huge
<br />
fully tail!)
<br />

<br />
And another thing: I saw that hot wheel commercial-how N*E*R*D*Y!  A little
<br />
plastic Sonic vs. A street shark, (or whatever the heck they're
<br />
called)-NERDY!  &lt;Sonic would, of course win&gt;
<br />

<br />
And with this Sonic movie-I talked to an inside source inside of Sega, (I
<br />
shall not reveal this source because I realize there is a Sega guy on this
<br />
list who could, in essense, be this guy's boss, sorry!! :)) and my source
<br />
said this game is going to definately be an animation, and the soundtrack
<br />
will be very new-aged and the theme will be somewhat adult based!  I don't
<br />
see how they're going to get away with this... Robotnik pulls out a laser
<br />
gun and Pearl Jam starts singing Glorified G?!?  Who knows with Sega...
<br />
anything's possible.  More info on this as I get it!  
<br />
