<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From: D.M. Quozl Falk &lt;quozl_at_netcom.com&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I even had plans of writing a tastefully naughty Bunnie story (which I've 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;developed already, and takes place 10 years after &quot;Doomsday&quot;, but is very 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;different from the other 10-years-after StH stories that have been done- 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;It would put the StH universe in a primarily positive light), but because 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;of circumstances, I'm ready to kill the project. :( I'd honestly like to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;be encouraged to write my tale, and I'd encourage anyone to encourage me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;to stay *and* write...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sure _somebody_ will, but it won't be me... (not meant as a flame, but 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I can't honesly put a smiley in there either...)
</em><br />

<br />
Hmm...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note to fan-fic authors (nobody in particular though): if your story 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contains sex, violence, or other possibly disturbing stuff, I suggest you 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; note that prominently at the beginning of it.  I could handle the grimness 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the show itself, but much of the fan-fic fic has gone an order of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; magnitude beyond that, and it's too much for me.
</em><br />

<br />
I would have to agree with Ron here, and had been planning the very 
<br />
thought of just such a disclaimer. (My planned story, as yet no title, 
<br />
was planned as a romance at a time when what was left of Mobius was being 
<br />
rebuilt...)
<br />

<br />
I guess that even under the most dire of circumstances, I believe in 
<br />
hope, which is why I really liked the SatAM (now SunAM) StH, because it 
<br />
*was* a positive theme within a grim world...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In fact, since I haven't read much of the fan-fic that's been sent to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list (I've stuck it in a &quot;to read&quot; directory, but don't know when I'll get to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it), would some volunteer out there like to summarize all the fan-fic done 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; so far in terms of plot and a rating re. violence/sex/whatever?
</em><br />

<br />
That is a very good idea, though I'd have to say Bookshire's WWW story 
<br />
page does just that!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;....Quozl!

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Creator, alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog (and inadvertantly responsible for the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;   Sonic mailing list)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No argument with the former, but (at the risk of trying to grab 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; credit/glory, which I don't mean to do) I sort of thought _I_ had something 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to do with the latter; I started (and still have) a mini-mailing list over 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a year ago and Erich (and others?) took the idea and made it a _real_ list.
</em><br />

<br />
I guess you don't know what did lead to the creation of the Sonic list 
<br />
then. For the record, I'll explain:
<br />

<br />
During the time I was proposing a.f.s-h in alt.config, a teenager going 
<br />
by the handle &quot;Tom Servo&quot;, who was already notorious for bogus newsgroup 
<br />
creations, decided to proclain (and then proceeded to) that he will 
<br />
create every newsgroup proposed, whether it went through discussion or 
<br />
not, for a few weeks. Deciding not to risk it, I decided to put a.f.s-h 
<br />
on hold until it blew over. (It wasn't until sometime in February I 
<br />
started it back up again, after bowing out in mid-December of last year...)
<br />
Thinking I had failed to get support (the opposite was true), Erich 
<br />
Schulman (sp?), et al, started work on the mailing list. Just the fact I 
<br />
put a.f.s-h on hold, because I did not want it tagged as &quot;bogus&quot; (which 
<br />
anything created by &quot;Tom Servo&quot; would have been automaticly been tagged 
<br />
as), I'm partly responsible for this mailing list's creation. Both have 
<br />
the same goals, but the mailing list has been more successful than the 
<br />
newsgroup, which saddens me. :(
<br />

<br />
*le sigh...*
<br />

<br />
....Quozl!
