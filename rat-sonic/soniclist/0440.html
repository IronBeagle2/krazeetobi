&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 2
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And when Ah looked up, she'd just vanished!  Gave me the
<br />
creeps!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was recounting her experience to the group that was
<br />
gathered inside a primitive but comfortable hut set in the hidden
<br />
village known as Knothole.  Sally, once heir-apparent to the
<br />
throne of Mobius; Sonic, leader of the group more by virtue of
<br />
his daring and speed than for any strategic brilliance; Rotor,
<br />
skilled with anything mechanical or electronic; Antoine, whose
<br />
clinging to the old traditions and protocols of the Mobian court
<br />
was almost his only personality trait; and Tails, a child in
<br />
comparison to the others but eager to please and absolutely
<br />
devoted to Sonic.  Though none of them had come of age
<br />
chronologically, they had all assumed the more-than-grown-up role
<br />
of resistance fighters.  For this group was the very heart of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters, dedicated to the overthrow of
<br />
Robotnik and the restoration of Mobius and its citizens.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am to be feeling creepuscular my very self!&quot; said
<br />
Antoine, huddled in the warmth of the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal,&quot; Sonic asked, &quot;you ever seen anyone dressed like
<br />
that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally addressed the palmtop computer she held in her hand.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole, did you get that description?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;AFFIRMATIVE, SALLY.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Project holographic image.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately a shimmering likeness of the strange figure
<br />
could be seen floating in mid-air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's her, Sally-girl!  She looked just like that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole, identify.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DESCRIPTION OF CLOTHING IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF THE
<br />
WESTERN NOMADS.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who the heck are the Nomads?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;FORMERLY A WARRIOR RACE, THE NOMADS HAVE CONFINED
<br />
THEMSELVES TO THE WESTERN DESERTS FOR THE LAST TWO CENTURIES,
<br />
MIGRATING BETWEEN TRADE CITIES.  HISTORICALLY, THEY HAVE NEVER
<br />
ACKNOWLEDGED THE ROYAL HOUSE, AND BY TREATY THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT
<br />
ALONE.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, yeah,&quot; Sonic said impatiently, &quot;but whose side are
<br />
they on?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;INSUFFICIENT DATA.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks a lot, Nicole!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Ah don't think this one was workin' for Robotnik,
<br />
Sugarhog.  You saw what she did to those SWAT-bots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's right, Sonic.  And she could have captured Bunnie
<br />
easily, but she didn't.&quot;  Sally paused.  &quot;And what was that about
<br />
a pin?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie produced the metal pin.  &quot;She said to give it to you,
<br />
and if it meant anything you were supposed to meet her tomorrow
<br />
night at Dragonsnest at moonrise.  By yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally studied the pin for a second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Seems to be a brooch of some sort, with...oh my gosh!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; several voices asked at once.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This pin has the coat of arms of the House of Acorn on it. 
<br />
This is the royal coat of arms!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone crowded around.  &quot;You sure about this, Sal?&quot; Sonic
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  There are...differences in the way it's reproduced
<br />
here, though.  I've never seen these variations before; I don't
<br />
know if they mean anything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Allowing me, my Princess,&quot; Antoine said formally.  &quot;I
<br />
happen to have learn-ed all zere is to be knowing about heraldry
<br />
and similar protocols.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snooze-time, guys,&quot; Sonic said in a stage whisper.  Tails
<br />
giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was herding zat!  But I will never mind your fun-
<br />
making.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sal!  Let Nicole figure it out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax, Sonic.  What have we got to lose?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;About an hour?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Antoine never heard the last remark, as he was intently
<br />
studying the brooch.  After a minute of studying and thinking and
<br />
&quot;Hmmm&quot;-ing, he seemed to realize something that caused him to
<br />
react with alarm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sacre bleu cheeze!  Zis is encreable!  Fantastique!  It is
<br />
even, how you say, spooky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot;  Sally asked urgently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To be beginning with, note ze shape of ze shield, zat it
<br />
is a circular.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's 'circle,' Antoine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Zat is what I am just saying, a circular.  However, your
<br />
father's coat of arms has ze six-sided shield, how you say, ze
<br />
hexagondola.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally wasn't even about to try.  &quot;OK, so the shield is a
<br />
different shape.  Anything else?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oui.  Note ze crown at ze top.  It has only ze two layers
<br />
whereas your father's coat of arms has ze crown with troi
<br />
layers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Big deal!&quot; Sonic chimed in.  &quot;So whoever made this was a
<br />
lousy forger.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, please!  I think Antoine is going somewhere with
<br />
this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I most certainly am.  Based on zese characteristics, zis
<br />
pin by law could only have been worn by one personage: by ze
<br />
Queen!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Queen!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactement.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was uncomfortably silent in the hut as Sally took the
<br />
brooch back from Antoine and stared at it.  She looked up, and
<br />
everyone could see that her face had lost some of its color.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This belonged to...my mother?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally didn't so much put the brooch down as she let it fall
<br />
from her hand to a nearby table.  As if in a trance, she walked
<br />
to a nearby window, leaned on the sill, and stared silently
<br />
outward.  Sonic walked over to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, you OK?&quot;  It was an agonizingly long time before she
<br />
answered, speaking to no one in particular:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of all the questions I ever asked my father, there was one
<br />
he'd never answer.  He...he never told me anything about my
<br />
mother.  I don't even know what she looked like.  There were
<br />
people in my life who were like a mother to me: Rosie my nanny,
<br />
my mentor Julayla.  But so many times I'd look out of my window
<br />
and see other children with their....&quot;  She paused, putting a
<br />
hand to her eyes.  &quot;I'm sorry; I forgot how much it hurt.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aunt Sally,&quot; Tails asked hesitantly, &quot;maybe Nicole knows
<br />
something about her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled.  &quot;Thanks, honey, but I've tried.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And what happened?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally once again spoke to the computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole, access royal archives.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ROYAL ARCHIVES ONLINE, SALLY.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please display all information about...about my mother.&quot; 
<br />
There was a tense second of waiting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ALL INFORMATION PERTAINING TO THE LAST QUEEN OF MOBIUS HAS
<br />
BEEN PLACED UNDER A LEVEL 7 SECURITY BLOCK.  ACCESS DENIED.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Rotor.  How serious is this level 7 block?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Extremely.  All I've been able to determine is that it's a
<br />
very complex numeric code.  I've never gotten very far in
<br />
cracking it.  Even Robotnik doesn't use anything more complex
<br />
than a level 5.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So now what, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it'll take me a day and a night of travelling to get
<br />
to Dragonsnest from here, so I'd better start getting ready.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, cool it, Sal.  I can get you there in a Sonic second!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know you can, Sonic, but you're not going to.  I'm going
<br />
alone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what!?  Sal, this could be a trap!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know that, Sonic, but if I have a chance to...you
<br />
understand why I'm doing this, don't you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, can't you talk her out of this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, if Sally can find out somethin' about her ma, Ah
<br />
think she should go for it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But you said yourself you had a weird feeling about this
<br />
character.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah still do.  But she doesn't feel dangerous, if you know
<br />
what Ah mean.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, there's nothing more to talk about.  I'm going to
<br />
Dragonsnest and I'm going alone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sal, you're going to need back-up!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ALONE, Sonic!&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
