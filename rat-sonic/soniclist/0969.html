ISSUE 16
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sonic Under Glass&quot;
<br />
The Freedom Fighters finally defeated Robotnik, and Sonic and Sally are
<br />
getting married.  But Robotnik reveals that he actually lured the Freedom
<br />
Fighters to Sleepy Hollow with promises of chili dogs.  There, he put them
<br />
to sleep with gas and then trapped them inside a virtual reality glass dome.
<br />
Inside the dome, all their wishes are fulfilled so no one will even think of
<br />
escaping.  Suddenly, clocks start melting (huh?), Sonic is holding up a
<br />
broom, and Uncle Chuck comes calling.  Uncle Chuck explains what happened to
<br />
everyone.  Sonic wants to get back at Robotnik, but also doesn't want to
<br />
because everyone else is so happy.  He decides to go for it, and makes
<br />
Robotnik's war machines reverse course and head back toward Robotnik.
<br />
Without alternative, Robotnik kills the virtual reality software.  Sonic and
<br />
Sally are reunited, and Sonic decides virtual reality is not a good place to
<br />
live in.
<br />

<br />
&quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik realizes there must be a spy in his midst because so many of his
<br />
missions have failed.  For a moment, he thought he found his spy (a mole).
<br />
He brings in the Wheel of Misfortune as a way to randomize his schemes to
<br />
destroy Mobius and prevent word of his plans getting back to Sonic.
<br />
Robotnik spins, and the wheel lands on &quot;undersea bank heist&quot;.  Robotnik's
<br />
lackeys go out to do the job and discover a note in the vault, and the
<br />
Freedom Fighters are right behind.  Robotnik spins again, and the wheel lands
<br />
on &quot;daring daylight art robbery&quot;.  Once again, Sonic is there, as is another
<br />
note.  Robotnik spins again, and this thime the wheel lands on &quot;mindless act
<br />
of terrorism&quot;.  And, once again, Sonic and a note appear.  Sonic and Sally
<br />
go to Robotnik's casino, and he thinks he has Sonic.  Actually, he does for
<br />
a moment, but Sonic is rescued in time.  Finally, Robotnik realizes his
<br />
wheel is rigged and that he's still not uncovered the spy.  In the next
<br />
panel, we see a building whose sign identifies it as &quot;Secret Intelligence
<br />
Headquarters&quot;.  Inside are Sonic, Sally, and the owl Harvey Who, the head
<br />
of secret intelligence.
<br />

<br />
Sonic-Grams notables--
<br />
(The announcements are now obsolete are omitted here.)
<br />
1. Sonic is 15 years old.
<br />
2. Sally is a squirrel (but not specifically a ground squirrel).  Antoine
<br />
gave his tail to Tails so that Tails would be able to fly.  Sonic rescued
<br />
Bunnie from the roboticizer, albeit a little late.  The comic Sally and the
<br />
cartoon Sally were different colors because, early on, Archie Comics didn't
<br />
have much information to go on as to what Sally should look like.
