Part 7
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans that had once occupied the city of Nilreb were soon
<br />
scattered across the Northern Continent.  Sebastian and Alison kept a
<br />
small band of them together, and it was their goal to make it to the
<br />
western coast, where it was said that the wild forest area offered a
<br />
perfect haven, almost entirely secluded from Robotnik's influence.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think we'll make it?&quot; Alison asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian looked at her and smiled.  He promised himself that he
<br />
would never come so close to giving up again, the way he had that rainy
<br />
night outside of Nilreb.  &quot;I know we will.&quot;  He offered his paw.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison took it.  &quot;Let's go, then.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knothole mourned the loss of Tolouse, and he was buried near the
<br />
Power Ring Pool, where they had set up a small memorial for those who had
<br />
given their lives to the cause.  Sally spoke to a gathering of the
<br />
Knothole residents, saying that Tolouse would always be remembered for his
<br />
devotion to the cause, and that he would be given his proper place in
<br />
history when the struggle against Robotnik was finally over.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nilreb was eventually rebuilt into another of Dr. Robotnik's &quot;major
<br />
research centers,&quot; and as far as he was concerned, the humans were done
<br />
for.  He would never accept that that many had escaped out from under him.
<br />
&nbsp;Coincidentally, the Freedom Fighters also decided that anybody who asked
<br />
would be told that they had no knowledge of humans still living on Mobius.
<br />
&nbsp;Should the wrong pair of ears ever ask, that would give the humans the
<br />
best chance of survival.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The struggle continued.
<br />

<br />
--- The End.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thus quoth the raven, nevermore.&quot;
<br />
