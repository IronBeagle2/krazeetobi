Part 2
<br />

<br />
One week later.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine saw him first, while on sentry duty.  He hurriedly took out
<br />
his com-link and activated it.  &quot;'Allo, Sonic?  Sonic, come quickly!  Zere
<br />
ees somebody in ze forest!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic replied and was beside Antoine only seconds later.  &quot;What's up,
<br />
Ant?  This isn't another one of your ghosts, I hope.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, no, look!&quot;  Antoine pointed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked.  &quot;Well well well, we have us a visitor.  Stay here, Ant.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian had been walking slowly through the forest when he almost
<br />
bumped into something he could have sworn wasn't there a second ago.  The
<br />
something spoke.  &quot;Hi there!  Who might you be?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian jumped back, ready to fight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic put his hands out in front of him.  &quot;Whoa, easy there, bud! 
<br />
I'm not loaded.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian looked at Sonic, and relaxed.  &quot;Sorry, you surprised me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic chuckled.  &quot;I seem to have that effect on a lot of people. 
<br />
Now, who are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian extended his paw.  &quot;My name is Sebastian.  Tell me, are you
<br />
Sonic the hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic shook his paw, chuckling again.  &quot;Why, yes, I am,&quot; he said with
<br />
mock-formality.  But then, he looked at the wolf with a thoughtful
<br />
expression.  &quot;Sebastian?  Now where have I heard that name before?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think I know.  I haven't met you before now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers.  &quot;Wait a
<br />
minute, I remember!  You knew a fox named Todd, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Todd?  Yes, I did!  Do you know him?  Is he here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's smile faded.  &quot;Well, I did know him...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian blinked.  &quot;What happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sighed.  &quot;Long story.  Really long.  Listen, would you like to
<br />
come back to Knothole with me?  I know Sally would love to meet you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knothole?  Yes, of course!  I was hoping I would find it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Heh.  Yeah well, it's not exactly a place you'd just happen to run
<br />
into.  We stay nice and hidden.  Have to, you know, with ol' Buttnik
<br />
sniffing around.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, then, let's go.&quot;  As they walked past the watchpost, Sonic
<br />
shouted, &quot;Hey, Ant, it's okay!  We're gonna scoot back to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, okay.  I'll be here, wi' ze eagle's eyes!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked.  &quot;Right, whatever.  See ya, Ant!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sebastian?  Really?&quot;  Sally studied the wolf.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian chuckled.  &quot;Everybody seems to already know me, around
<br />
here.  And you, you really are Princess Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, things being what they are, I'm just Sally for now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian bowed his head slightly.  &quot;Even so, it is an honor to meet
<br />
you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled.  &quot;It is an honor for me, too, Sebastian.   We've heard
<br />
so much about you.&quot;  Right then, there was a knock at the door.  &quot;Come in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse entered the room.  &quot;Sorry, Sally, I hope I'm not
<br />
interrupting.  Rotor just wanted me to tell you that he won't be able to
<br />
make tonight's meeting on time.  He... uh... needs to clean up his hut.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally chuckled, imagining why.  &quot;Oh, that's okay.  Tolouse, there's
<br />
somebody you might want to meet.  This is Sebastian.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse blinked.  &quot;Sebastian?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we go again, Sebastian thought with a smile.  Turning to Sally,
<br />
he said, &quot;Is there anybody here who doesn't know me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Todd did talk a lot about you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Todd, yes.  Tell me, please, what happened to him?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed, and the room fell silent for a short moment.  &quot;It's...
<br />
it's a long story.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what Sonic said.  If it's alright, I would like to hear it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at Tolouse.  &quot;Do you want to?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I could, I guess...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian shook his head.  &quot;I never knew about all that.  Poor fox,
<br />
no wonder he was always ready for a fight.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally said, &quot;Sebastian, if I may ask, Todd said you were travelling
<br />
with others.  What happened to them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time Sebastian sighed.  &quot;That's not quite as long of a story. 
<br />
Basically, we got trapped and I was the only one who escaped.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh.  I'm sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay.  That's kind of why I'm here.  I would like to help you
<br />
out fighting Robotnik, if I may.  I have nothing else to do, now.&quot;  He
<br />
gave a small chuckle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, we'll just have to see,&quot; Sally said with a smile.  She looked
<br />
out the window, which was showing a darkening sky.  &quot;It's about time for
<br />
the meeting.  Why don't you join us, Sebastian?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you,&quot; Sebastian said.  &quot;I appreciate that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great.&quot;  Studying Sebastian's vest, she said, &quot;I see you are a
<br />
master of Quandolo...&quot;
<br />
