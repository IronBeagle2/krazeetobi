<br />Part 1
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;MOMMY!!!&quot;...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, all these years later, the pain still remained.  The pain, and the 
<br />
bitter, driving desire for revenge.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you get it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course we got it!  Let's juice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Sally, and Bunnie raced over to a nearby alleyway, hiding themselves
<br />
in the shadows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; Sally said, &quot;I hope this works!&quot;  She looked at the timer displayed
<br />
on Nicole.  &quot;10, 9, 8, 7...&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked at his chronometer.  Hoping that all was going as planned, 
<br />
he began counting down at the time they said the charges would be armed.  &quot;...5,
<br />
4, 3, 2, 1!&quot;  He looked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The explosion rocked the city, engulfing the coolant treatment plant in an 
<br />
angry display of fire and thunder, reducing it to a pile of twisted metal and 
<br />
jagged concrete in mere seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YES!&quot; Tolouse shouted, his voice drowned out by the din of the blast.  
<br />
&quot;YES!&quot; he shouted again, clapping his paws and howling with victory.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ALL RIGHT!&quot; Sally shouted and grabbed Sonic in a victory hug, a lovely 
<br />
sight silhouetted by the fire consuming what was left of the plant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie giggled.  &quot;Ah don't mean to interrupt y'all, Sugarhog, but we need 
<br />
to be gettin' out of here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic chuckled.  Sally regained her composure (after giving Sonic a quick 
<br />
kiss) and spoke into the com-link.  &quot;Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse pulled out his com-link.  &quot;Yes, Sally?&quot;  They could hear the 
<br />
excitement in each other's voices.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We did it.  Meet us over by the building rubble on the northern side of 
<br />
the plant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm on my way.&quot;  He gave a quick look around, and left his hiding place, 
<br />
cautiously making his way down the streets toward the rubble, eyes continually 
<br />
going back to the demolishment of the plant.  It was while he was looking at the
<br />
destruction when he ran into something, or rather somebody, and both he and this
<br />
other figure fell to the ground.  Tolouse immediately looked for a hiding place,
<br />
but then he noticed what he had run into.  It was a fox!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;W-who are you?&quot; this other fox said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was about to ask the same thing.  The two foxes studied each other 
<br />
for quite some time when the com-link broke their concentration.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, are you okay?  Where are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse, still keeping his eyes on the other fox, took out the com-link.  
<br />
&quot;I'm okay, Sally.  I'm coming.&quot;  He holstered the com-link and said, &quot;We can't 
<br />
stay here.  Come on.&quot;  He motioned for the other fox to follow him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the two made their way to where the others were, Tolouse said, &quot;My name 
<br />
is Tolouse.  What's yours?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other fox was silent for a moment before finally saying, &quot;Todd.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And what are you doing here in Robotropolis?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd shrugged and then said, &quot;Well, what are you doing here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was thinking about what to say when he heard a new sound.  Looking 
<br />
back, they saw a fleet of hovercraft heading towards the remains of the coolant 
<br />
treatment plant.  &quot;We better get out of here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse ran the rest of the way, with Todd following.  They soon reached 
<br />
the rubble, where the others were hiding.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here he comes!&quot;  Sonic said.  &quot;And...he's got somebody with him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Bunnie looked as well.  Tolouse was running towards them, with 
<br />
another fox running along behind him.  &quot;I wonder who that is,&quot; Sally said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was soon there, and he spoke.  &quot;Hey.  We need to get out of here.  
<br />
There are a bunch of hovercraft coming.  Oh, this is Todd.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd gave a small wave, but kept quiet.  Sally studied this new arrival, 
<br />
but not for long.  &quot;Hello Todd.&quot;  Addressing everybody, she said, &quot;Okay, let's 
<br />
get back to Knothole.&quot;  And they began making there way back to the city limits,
<br />
where they could safely hide in the junkyards as Sonic transported them home.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they left the city, Todd said only one more thing.  &quot;Knothole?&quot;  There 
<br />
was a look of hope in his eyes.
<br />
<br />To be continued.
