Part 1
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night time had come, and with it a cold, harsh rain.  He slowly
<br />
walked on, unable to see where he was going, not really even caring.  His
<br />
group, the group he had promised that he would protect, was gone, fallen
<br />
victim to an ambush by one of Robotnik's patrols only days before.  Now,
<br />
the only thing that he could still claim his own was his vest, a vest
<br />
which stated that he was an expert in Quandolo, one of Mobius's oldest
<br />
martial arts.  He knew many martial arts, actually, and had earned many
<br />
praises for his skill.  But that was all in the past.  The vest was in
<br />
tatters, now.  Having had almost no food or water since the attack, so was he.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never thought that he would just give up.  He had vowed that as
<br />
long as he was alive, he would do everything he could to keep his group
<br />
together, to somehow help them survive in the desolate world that Mobius
<br />
had become.  But what can you do when there is nobody to protect anymore? 
<br />
His friends were now either dead or roboticized.  Maybe it was time to
<br />
stop running.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked to the top of the hill, the last thing he expected to
<br />
see was lights in the distance.  There was a city here!  In all the years
<br />
on the run, he had steered clear of the cities.  They were Robotnik's
<br />
territory now, each one having been turned into a technological fortress,
<br />
run by robots that had once been inhabitants of Mobius.  Now, however, he
<br />
saw this city as his goal.  He would simply walk up to the first Swat-Bot
<br />
he saw, and surrender.  Surrender, and it would all finally be over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He never made it to his goal.  Near the city limits, his legs gave
<br />
out from under him, and he collapsed, unconscious.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison turned off the light, ready for bed.  She looked out her
<br />
window, which had a wide view of the land south of Nilreb.  Not that there
<br />
was really all that much to see.  Every time she looked out, she saw the
<br />
same expanse of plains, stretching almost to the horizon, broken only by a
<br />
chain of low mountains far off in the distance.  Now, however, it was
<br />
impossible to see even that much, obscured by the darkness and the rain. 
<br />
She was just about to turn around and climb into bed when a lightning bolt
<br />
illuminated the area for a brief time, and something caught her eye.  Oh
<br />
gods, she thought.  There's somebody out there!  Soon she was dressed and
<br />
out of the house.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she got there, she realized that the figure was a wolf and he
<br />
looked badly wounded.  The fact that he was a wolf, however, was enough to
<br />
put him in grave danger.  Mustering all her strength, she managed to pick
<br />
up the wolf in her arms and carry him to her house, and safety.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He woke up fully expecting to be in a prison cell.  What he was not
<br />
expecting was to wake up in a warm bed with his wounds bandaged.  He sat
<br />
up in surprise, but his sore muscles made him regret it, and he lay back
<br />
down again, growling softly at the pain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly turned to the direction of the voice, and again was struck
<br />
by the pain.  &quot;Oh!  Who's there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay,&quot; the female voice said.  &quot;You're safe for now.  Just try
<br />
to get some rest.  You almost died out there.&quot;  As she spoke, she came
<br />
over, and he could now see her face.  When he did, he gasped, eyes open wide.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know,&quot; she said, understanding his reaction.  &quot;Don't hold it
<br />
against me, okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But... you're human!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison nodded.  &quot;Yes, I am.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought there were no humans left.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, we're still here, actually, thanks to our 'great leader' Dr.
<br />
Robotnik.&quot;  These last words were heavy with sarcasm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't understand.  He didn't just roboticize all of the humans as
<br />
well?  I had been told many times that he had.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who can understand anything that maniac does?  Here, I'll try to
<br />
explain it.  All the humans were forced to come here to live right after
<br />
Robotnik overthrew King Acorn.  He claimed it was part of his plan to make
<br />
Mobius a better place to live, but we all know better.  We've heard about
<br />
what he's been doing to anybody who isn't a human.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And yet he claims to have roboticized you all?  Why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison shrugged.  &quot;Ego?  Who knows?  And he actually has roboticized
<br />
quite a few.  That's his standard punishment for any crime.  Or rather,
<br />
anything he says is a crime.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Such as harboring a wolf?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, yes, but I don't care.  I just can't stand around and watch
<br />
him hurt people like that, human or otherwise.  I do what I can to help.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You must be careful.  If he found out you were doing this...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison nodded, shivering a little.  &quot;I know, and he's caught people
<br />
in the past, but...  I would rather have that fear than feel guilty for
<br />
the rest of my life.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wolf nodded.  &quot;You are a brave girl.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison shrugged.  &quot;You get some rest, okay?  You need it.&quot;  She
<br />
turned and walked towards the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, wait.  I don't even know your name.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison turned and smiled.  &quot;Alison.  What's yours?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sebastian.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened the door.  &quot;Get some sleep, Sebastian.  I'll be back soon
<br />
with some food.&quot;  She stepped out and closed the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian turned on his side, slowly, his muscles still aching. 
<br />
Soon, he was asleep again, breathing peacefully, something he hadn't been
<br />
able to do for a long time.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Days went by, and Sebastian's morale improved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian learned that Alison owned and managed a restaurant by day
<br />
(&quot;The food isn't that great, but it's a pleasant place for people to meet,
<br />
when the Swat-Bots aren't patrolling through it, of course.&quot;) while
<br />
usually staying at home or helping people (&quot;like you, Sebastian&quot;) at night.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have there been many others?&quot; Sebastian asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A few, though not as many as there used to be.  They usually don't
<br />
stay long, since the risk of getting caught is pretty high if you don't
<br />
keep moving.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, I know all about that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison learned that Sebastian had trained in martial arts in the hope
<br />
of becoming an instructor (&quot;Standing up and fighting for yourself was
<br />
something I always believed in, and I wanted to show others how they could
<br />
do so.&quot;) when the coup hit.  Then, he and a group of others fled and were
<br />
always on the move, trying to stay alive and safe from Robotnik and his
<br />
army of robots.  &quot;We were doing okay, until a few days ago.  Somehow, we
<br />
just walked right into a Swat-Bot patrol.  I managed to get away, but...&quot; 
<br />
He shook his head.  &quot;But I was the only one.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian nodded.  &quot;Well, for days I just wandered around.  Then I
<br />
saw this city off in the distance and I thought that maybe I should just
<br />
give myself up.  I couldn't keep running anymore.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hope you still don't feel that way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.  No,  I don't think so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good!  I wouldn't want all my efforts to go to waste.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just wished I could have helped them.&quot;  Sebastian sighed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know.  Believe me, I know.  But you're still alive and you're
<br />
still flesh and blood.  You can still help others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian nodded again, silent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, you can start by helping me.  I need to organize my food
<br />
inventory over at the restaurant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The restaurant?  It would be dangerous for me out there, wouldn't it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison chuckled.  &quot;Well, yes, if we were to go above ground.&quot;  She
<br />
motioned for him to follow, and she lead him down to the cellar.  Opening
<br />
a door, she said, &quot;This leads directly to the inventory room.  In times
<br />
like this, you take a few precautions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, let's go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several days later, Sebastian decided it was time he should go.  &quot;I
<br />
don't want to put you at any further risk.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison nodded.  &quot;I understand.  Do you know where you'll go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, not yet.  But don't worry, I'll do my best to survive.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison smiled.  &quot;You will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They spent some time preparing some supplies for his journey. 
<br />
Finally, when nightfall came, he stood at the back door, ready to leave.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, wait a second, I have something for you,&quot; Alison said.  She left
<br />
the room and soon came back holding a vest.  It was Sebastian's Quandolo
<br />
vest, and he could see she had mended it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alison,&quot; he said with surprise.  He put it on and looked it over. 
<br />
The vest was in perfect condition.  &quot;Thank you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She smiled.  &quot;You're welcome.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He picked up his bag and opened the door.  He looked back at her, and
<br />
for a lingering moment, their eyes met.  There were thoughts, ponderings,
<br />
on what could possibly have been, perhaps in another time, maybe under
<br />
different circumstances.  Then, the moment was gone.  &quot;Goodbye, Alison,
<br />
and thank you again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She gave a small wave.  &quot;Be careful, Sebastian.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian nodded, and left.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood at the top of the hill, the same hill that he had first seen
<br />
the lights of Nilreb from.  He had been wondering where he could go from
<br />
here, but without any ideas.  Then, one finally came to him.  He
<br />
remembered long ago, when he had heard tales of a group living somewhere
<br />
in the Great Forest, fighting Robotnik.  Thinking of no other alternative,
<br />
he decided he should try and find them.  He set out towards the Great
<br />
Forest, far to the west, the Mobian moon lighting his way.
<br />
