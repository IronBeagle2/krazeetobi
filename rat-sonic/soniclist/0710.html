&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 9
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She WHAT!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Sonic and Bunnie had heard the translation, they
<br />
headed for Sally's hut.  At first she was still too wrapped up in
<br />
her grief to respond; when they burst into her hut she simply
<br />
said: &quot;Please, just leave me alone.&quot;  But when they told her of
<br />
Sandy's disappearance and of the note she had left behind, Sally
<br />
was on her feet in a second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is terrible!  How long ago did she leave?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah don't know, Sally, and neither does anyone else.  She's
<br />
as quiet as Sonic is quick.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That means she's got a head start.  We still might be able
<br />
to catch her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Forget it, Sal,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;she doesn't want to get
<br />
caught.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sally wasn't listening.  Instead she was writing a quick
<br />
note, inserting it into one of the mechanical carrier pidgeons
<br />
Rotor had designed, and was programming it to fly to Uncle
<br />
Chuck's hideout in Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You think she means it?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course she does.  Look at the bottom of the letter.  You
<br />
see that smudge where her signature would be?  She made that with
<br />
a drop of her own blood.  I don't know much about the Nomads, but
<br />
I DO know they're firm believers in blood-vengeance!  She blames
<br />
Robotnik for our mother's death and she's going after him.  We've
<br />
got to stop her!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa!  Time out!&quot; Sonic yelled.  &quot;Since when are we in the
<br />
business of saving Robuttnik's butt?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Believe me, that's not the point!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I'm missing something here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I had to watch my mother die and I couldn't do a
<br />
thing about it.  I am NOT going to sit around here while my
<br />
sister commits suicide!  Now come on!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without another word, Sally raced out the door.  Sonic had
<br />
never seen her so worked up before, but he was even more
<br />
surprised when Bunnie said, half-aloud and with a broad grin on
<br />
her face: &quot;Welcome back, Sally-girl!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell you later, Sugarhog.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a couple of minutes of waiting for Dulcy's head to
<br />
clear after her latest landing.  Once she understood what was
<br />
happening, though, she was winging her way back to Robotropolis
<br />
with Sonic, Sally and Bunnie on board.  All the while they were
<br />
flying, they scanned the open country for any sign of Sandy.  At
<br />
one point, Sally ordered Dulcy to land.  Even before Dulcy had
<br />
touched down Sally had lept off of Dulcy's back, rolled on the
<br />
ground to cushion the landing, sprang to her feet, and ran toward
<br />
a small bush.  There was a piece of torn cloth on it, from
<br />
Sandy's cloak.  They were heading in the right direction.  No
<br />
sooner had the others picked themselves up from Dulcy's landing
<br />
than Sally was urging the dragon to get back in the air again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a little while they touched down at a garbage dump
<br />
outside of Robotropolis.  This was a common rendezvous point for
<br />
the freedom fighters on their various missions.  As soon as they
<br />
were on the ground, Sally had Nicole in hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole!  Display the three most likely routes between the
<br />
dump and Robotnik's headquarters!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly, a shimmering hologram map of the city floated
<br />
before them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, Bunnie will take the southern route, Sonic will take
<br />
the northern route, and I'll go up the middle.  We'll meet at
<br />
Uncle Chuck's; maybe he'll have heard something.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What if we find her?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get her to Uncle Chuck's; I don't care how.  Dulcy, you
<br />
retrace our path and look for her again; I want to make sure we
<br />
didn't pass her on the way here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sally ran off, leaving the other freedom fighters
<br />
standing in the garbage dump.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You want to tell me what that 'Welcome back' thing was
<br />
about?&quot; Sonic asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, that!  Well, Sally ain't been herself lately, what with
<br />
her ma dyin' and all.  I was just glad to get the old Sally
<br />
back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me, too!  Good luck, Bunnie; gotta juice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good luck Sugarhog!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sonic tore off on his appointed route, Dulcy took
<br />
to the air once more, and Bunnie started on her way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was never keen about coming to Robotropolis, no
<br />
matter how important the missions.  The city had changed so much
<br />
under Robotnik that it was nothing but a gigantic threat.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After ten minutes of walking, Bunnie attempted to get her
<br />
bearings.  This had been the oldest part of town before Robotnik
<br />
blighted everything.  The buildings were low and the structures
<br />
square.  Bunnie dimly remembered that the building where she was
<br />
sheltering herself had been the old Klein Bottle Works. 
<br />
Cautiously she rounded a corner.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking to her right, she froze: the unmistakable shape of a
<br />
SWAT-bot lurked in a shadow.  She wondered whether to make a run
<br />
for it.  Yet the SWATbot didn't move after several seconds. 
<br />
Emboldened, and fervently hoping that it wasn't equipped with a
<br />
motion sensor, Bunnie edged toward it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once she got closer, Bunnie could see the hole punched into
<br />
its chest.  She could also see another SWATbot lying on the
<br />
ground in three pieces.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep,&quot; Bunnie thought to herself, &quot;this is Sandy's calling
<br />
card, all right!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down the street.  There was something else in the
<br />
shadows further along.  Cautiously moving toward it, she saw
<br />
another fallen SWATbot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oo-wee!  This is just like followin' a trail of bread
<br />
crumbs!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On she went, hiding in shadows and tracing a trail of fallen
<br />
SWATbots.  She thought she'd counted seven wrecked bots--and who
<br />
knows how many before she picked up Sandy's trail--when she
<br />
turned a corner.  There wasn't a SWATbot to be seen, not even the
<br />
smallest part.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh-oh!  Ran out of bread crumbs.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly she thought she could hear a hover unit
<br />
approaching.  That meant more bots!  She quickly ducked into an
<br />
alleyway.  Bunnie was so intent on wondering what to do next, she
<br />
didn't notice the metallic hand inching out of the shadows behind
<br />
her and getting closer and closer.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
