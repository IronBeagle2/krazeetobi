Hi, fellow Sonic fans!
<br />

<br />
I'd have to agree with Jeff ( jpegnato_at_vt.edu) about the introduction
<br />
of Sally's jacket (or is it a vest) in the 2nd year of showing.  It hardly
<br />
even covers her decently (if that is what the producers ultimately
<br />
wanted), and she was never nude as in &quot;offensively&quot; nude.  Why 
<br />
bother with it?
<br />

<br />
Another thing that Jeff brought up:  her species.  It's pretty easy to
<br />
tell that Sonic is a hedgehog (even the the title says that), Tails is
<br />
unmistakably a fox, Bunny is a rabbit, Rotor is a walrus, etc.  Sally
<br />
to me has been somewhat of a mistery as to what species she is.
<br />
According to Jeff, she's a vixen (?)  I used to think that Sally was more
<br />
of the deer persuasion, but after seeing that her father had a tail
<br />
(though it didn't seem to fit the general fox tail, but hey, this is the car-
<br />
toon universe), I'm not so sure.  If she is a fox, where's her tail?  All
<br />
I see is a small stub of fur on her rump.  Does it grow in when she
<br />
comes of age (becomes 18 years old), or was there an accident in
<br />
the past where the tail was lost?  If we go on the assumption that
<br />
she is a fox, that may explain why Tails calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; all the
<br />
time, though this could be more the result of a &quot;status nickname&quot;,
<br />
since Tails lost his family sometime after the coup.  The title could
<br />
come from years of Sally taking care of Tails after his family was
<br />
lost.  Then again, anything is possible.
<br />

<br />
Any further input would be appreciated.
<br />

<br />
