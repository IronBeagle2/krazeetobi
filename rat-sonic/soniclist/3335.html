<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, I wouldn't kill you. I don't care if I hear comments of praise or

<br />
OK, you asked for it :^)
<br />

<br />
Spoiler form feed:
<br />

<br />
The beginning was a bad start for me, since it seemed to be basically a 
<br />
rip-off of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  And shouldn't the 
<br />
guardian of the Island (these days, Knuckles) be able to bypass all those 
<br />
traps and stuff?  And death-traps seem a bit out-of-character for Knuckles'
<br />
ancestors - were they so anti-technology they'd _kill_ to prevent it from 
<br />
getting out?  And I have a hard time believing Knuckles is enough of an 
<br />
athlete to have escaped all those traps (and a harder time about his 
<br />
dreadlocks enabling him to fly).
<br />

<br />
So Archimedes is an evolved fire-ant who dresses like Crocodile Dundee?
<br />
Sorry, didn't work for me, but I don't believe in evolution (even if I did, 
<br />
to go from ants like we have today to sentience in a few hundred years (how 
<br />
old _is_ the Floating Island anyway?) is a bit much to swallow...)
<br />

<br />
Speaking of swallowing: not to restart the &quot;what meat do sentient furries 
<br />
eat?&quot; thread, but I found it ironic that Archimedes was an ant and echidnas 
<br />
are spiny ANT-eaters... :^)
<br />

<br />
And Enerjak being Dimitri after a long nap - I get the feeling of &quot;been 
<br />
there done that&quot; but we'll see where you take it...
<br />

<br />
At least we now know Knuckles' knuckles are part of him (from the letter 
<br />
column), but it still requires a bit of suspension of belief that he can 
<br />
do what he does without discrete fingers...
<br />

<br />
Bottom line: I've never been a Knuckles fan either, and only put up with 
<br />
him because he was part of Sonic's world.  I'll see the mini-series 
<br />
through, but if it becomes a regular series, I'll probably give it a pass - 
<br />
the characters aren't cute furries like the Freedom Fighters, and my other
<br />
tastes in comic books run more towards superheroes (which ended with Crisis 
<br />
on Infinite Earths - don't get me started on that), and Star-Trek, which 
<br />
also recently ended.  I also collect Disney, but don't make a great effort 
<br />
to find the time to read them.  Anyway, to get back on topic: I'd rather 
<br />
see more effort put into the Freedom Fighters (e.g., another Princess Sally 
<br />
or Tails mini-series).
<br />

<br />
Sorry to be so negative, but I guess I see the whole Knuckles thing as one 
<br />
more exercise in pushing the video game stuff, which is understandable, but 
<br />
I just can't get into it...
<br />

<br />
BTW, the art was good though :^)
<br />

<br />
Ron
