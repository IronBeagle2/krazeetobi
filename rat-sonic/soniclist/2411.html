Hello Everybody!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn't post very often because of the $203 phone bill I got
<br />
from calling AOL (KILL THEM, PLEASE!), but I sent a request for an
<br />
unlimited E-mail service (DC's CapAccess &lt;just in case you want it,
<br />
E-mail me&gt;), and got it!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, Sonic stuff (I bet previous stuff was NOT interesting):
<br />

<br />
I am currently working on some projects relating StH and this list.
<br />
A story (that one is incredibly slow. I think I know how Archie
<br />
feels), a picture, a statue of Sonic and Sally back-to-back looking
<br />
kind of mean (that one has a quote under it. I got the idea from
<br />
the StH game name. The quote is &quot;Mettle is power, Metal is death&quot;),
<br />
and the last one is a Sonic the Hedgehog &quot;Blue&quot; (yellow) Pages.
<br />
That last one will have the E-mail addresses of all the people who
<br />
called in 1996 (and maybe before that). That thing has graphics, a
<br />
small list info file, and a &quot;Buttons Hall of Fame&quot; page. That page
<br />
will have the names of people who wrote stories (I will ESPECIALLY
<br />
look that Dan's name is in place :') ), who run lists, and who just
<br />
need to be recognized. That file (Yes, just one 'Neobook' file
<br />
&lt;Isn't there someone from Neosoft here&gt;) is just a reference for
<br />
people with bad memories (such as myself), and it is NOT
<br />
copyrighted (details within). It should be finished some time soon
<br />
(I hope).
<br />

<br />
Now for some comics:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you guys have been talking about issue #33, I just got
<br />
issue #32. I am not blaming Archie, but the delivery around here
<br />
is extremely bad!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ancient history -&gt; I don't know if anyone noticed (no one
<br />
posted, anyway), but in Spandize's (spelling?) cover art of issue
<br />
#31 is a small picture, hidden in the upper left corner in the
<br />
mountains. The picture is a head of a person (sort of like
<br />
japanimation) with a fist extended forward. This picture does NOT
<br />
look like a coincidence. Well, at least it not like what Disney is
<br />
doing with their cartoon classics (word SEX in &quot;Lion King&quot;. Want
<br />
more? Too bad).
<br />

<br />
Stories:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There seems to be a Star Trek &quot;craze&quot; going on here. What?
<br />
Run out of Freedom Fighter ideas? (no offence intended). Someone
<br />
(Drazen?) posted about &quot;furry&quot; being a slur in his story. I thought
<br />
that most of the Mobius inhabitants WERE &quot;furry's.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Mail To Archie:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Archie guys said that they have enough story suggestions to
<br />
last them 1.5 years. Is it possible to create a sort of
<br />
&quot;competition&quot;, where people send in a lot of stories, and the best
<br />
ones are picked (this would definitely improve the plots), or would
<br />
that just create mayhem, and put the entire section of Archie under
<br />
6 feet of 1 paragraph :') suggestions? Also, why can't Archie use
<br />
&quot;To be continued&quot;'s? (just curious)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S. I am glad to see most of Archie's Sonic division on this
<br />
list (and in my &quot;Blue&quot; pages)
<br />

<br />
And finally, a question off topic:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has anyone heard of the writer Tuve Janson? He published a
<br />
couple of books somewhere in Europe. All of those books are about
<br />
a small group of animals that have some interesting adventures. I
<br />
have one of his books, titled &quot;The Magician's Hat&quot;. If you have any
<br />
info on this author, please reply to my E-mail. Please note:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I HAVE A NEW E-MAIL ADDRESS!
