<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; unmistakably a fox, Bunny is a rabbit, Rotor is a walrus, etc.  Sally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; to me has been somewhat of a mistery as to what species she is.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; According to Jeff, she's a vixen (?)  I used to think that Sally was more
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; of the deer persuasion, but after seeing that her father had a tail
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; (though it didn't seem to fit the general fox tail, but hey, this is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; car- toon universe), I'm not so sure.  If she is a fox, where's her tail?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; All I see is a small stub of fur on her rump.  Does it grow in when she
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; comes of age (becomes 18 years old), or was there an accident in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; the past where the tail was lost?  If we go on the assumption that
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; In a issue of Sonic the Hedgehog comic book, the editor replied to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a similar question asked by Jeff and the others -- the answer from the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; editor was that Sally is a fox, if I remember correctly.  But I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; backtrack and check on that fact.
</em><br />

<br />
As far as I know, this question was first asked in issue #5 by Graham  
<br />
Smith, Turkey Creek, KY. The answer was that Sally is a _squirrel_, not a  
<br />
fox. This was asked again in #14, #16 and #17, always with the same  
<br />
result. In issue #19 there even was a question if Sally is a tree squirrel  
<br />
or a ground squirrel.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; According to the editor of Sonic The Hedgehog comic books, Tails
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; got his second tail from Antione which explains why Antione has no tail.
</em><br />

<br />
This was mentioned in issue #2 (regular series) in the story 'All the  
<br />
mail's about Tails!'. They took the funniest opinions of their readers  
<br />
about Tails two tails and put them into a two-page story. This particular  
<br />
idea came from Tom Kilroe, Tega Kay, SC.
<br />

<br />
Of course, I wouldn't rely too much on what the editors of the comic book  
<br />
tell you. To my opinion they tend to guess if they don't know the correct  
<br />
answer or they just try to avoid it. In issue #7 someone asked Sonic &quot;Why  
<br />
are you so good-looking and smart and how old are you?&quot;. The answer was  
<br />
&quot;The only way to remain _good looking_ is to be _smart_ and never reveal  
<br />
your _age_.&quot;.
<br />

<br />
However, in issue #16 someone said he had a chapter book that says Sonic  
<br />
is fifteen years old, and the editors immediately fell for it and approved  
<br />
it. Well, the only 15-year-old I know of is Knuckles (mentioned in the  
<br />
manual for 'Sonic III'.
<br />

<br />
Only my opinion... don't flame me
<br />

<br />
