<br />
This isn't going to be a recap of CS#3; I'll let John Johnston's review
<br />
stand for submission to the FAQ File.  Instead, there are a couple of
<br />
loose ends I want to address.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Southern Crossover&quot; represents a vast improvement over &quot;Growing Pains&quot;
<br />
which started out strong in Part 1 and went into a nosedive in Part 2.
<br />
Still, Gallagher has demonstrated he has something to learn about story
<br />
structure.
<br />

<br />
Of the two major trouble spots, the more minor of the two has to do with
<br />
the subplot of Tails as The Chosen One (as prelude to the upcoming
<br />
series &quot;A Sense of History&quot;).  Tails certainly meets one of the major
<br />
requirements of a mythological hero: he is the runt of the litter, the
<br />
small one, the youth.  He has set out to prove himself to his elders and
<br />
discovers that he is in for more than he bargained for.  By the same
<br />
token, Athair as shaman takes the role of the Helper in Tails' adventure
<br />
(I'll admit it: when I got hold of SC#3 I also got out my copy of Joseph
<br />
Campbell's &quot;Hero With A Thousand Faces&quot;).
<br />

<br />
All this would be well and good, except that there was no foreshadowing
<br />
of Tails' adventure until he was let off in the crater.  Tails (and the
<br />
reader) then get a crash course in Mobian cosmology -- or at least the
<br />
highlights thereof -- before an abrupt turn back to the plot.  Tails
<br />
neither mentions nor reflects upon what has happened to him once outside
<br />
the crater.  Perhaps this is all prelude to Tails' larger adventure
<br />
still to come, but it's also clumsy storytelling -- rather like a
<br />
3-course meal consisting of soup, salad, and a roast turkey swallowed
<br />
whole.
<br />

<br />
Yet the more grievous error is to be found on SC#3, page 21.  Tails
<br />
finally admits that he misses the group from Knothole, that he had been
<br />
resentful of them, and that he now realizes that they really did care
<br />
about him.
<br />

<br />
The problem with this declaration is that there is no evidence to back
<br />
it up.  Aside from dropping Sonic's name a couple of times, you would
<br />
think that Tails hadn't bestowed a moment's thought upon any of them.
<br />
He was eloquent enough in resenting their &quot;infantile treatment&quot; of him
<br />
(SC#1, p. 5), but does he miss them?  Is he shown remembering better
<br />
times with any of them?  Does he ever wish they were with him when he
<br />
was being subjected to attacks by Octobot or the Wing Dingoes?  No.  His
<br />
primary concern is himself--in the pages of &quot;Tails To Astonish.&quot;  Yet
<br />
we're asked to believe that he got over his resentment of Sonic et al.
<br />
somewhere along the way.  It is not the job of the writer to ask us to
<br />
believe that something has happened -- it is to SHOW it happening, as
<br />
plausibly as possible.  This Gallagher failed to do.
<br />

<br />
One of the limitations of comics is their limited ability to show a
<br />
character's &quot;inner life&quot; -- their thoughts, aspirations, emotions.
<br />
Everything has to be out front as quickly as possible because deadlines
<br />
are approaching and space is limited.  In this respect, Japanese _manga_
<br />
have the advantage.  With stories in Japanese comics running to hundreds
<br />
of pages (and sometimes being serialized for years if they are
<br />
successful), there is space for a character to be introspective, to have
<br />
an emotional life.  It is this -- and not just the novelty of being a
<br />
two-tailed fox -- that has spawned a following for Tails.  His fans
<br />
sense a character with a personality, with feelings.  But the Tails of
<br />
&quot;Growing Pains&quot; and (to a lesser extent) &quot;Southern Crossover&quot; gets
<br />
seriously shortchanged in this regard.  He becomes a character reading
<br />
lines.  And when the reader is simply told &quot;He feels this-and-that&quot;
<br />
without being made to understand WHY, the reader is shortchanged as
<br />
well.
<br />

<br />
My $.02.
