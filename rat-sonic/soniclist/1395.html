<br />II. SOURCE DESCRIPTIONS
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. SONIC THE HEDGEHOG EPISODE GUIDE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   First Season: 1993-94
<br />
<br />Super Sonic
<br />
Writer: Jules Dennis
<br />
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
<br />
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
<br />
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
<br />
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
<br />
things without it.
<br />
<br />Sonic Boom
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
<br />
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
<br />
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
<br />
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
<br />
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
<br />
for Sally's father proves futile.
<br />
<br />Sonic and Sally
<br />
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
<br />
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
<br />
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
<br />
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
<br />
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
<br />
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
<br />
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
<br />
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a &quot;Stepford
<br />
Sally.&quot;
<br />
<br />Hooked on Sonics
<br />
Writer: Randy Rogel
<br />
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
<br />
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
<br />
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
<br />
has to rescue him.
<br />
<br />Ultra Sonic
<br />
Writer: David Villaire
<br />
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
<br />
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
<br />
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
<br />
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
<br />
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.
<br />
<br />Sonic's Nightmare
<br />
Writer: Frank Santopadre
<br />
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
<br />
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
<br />
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
<br />
Sally's being roboticized.
<br />
<br />Warp Sonic
<br />
Writer: Matt Uitz
<br />
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
<br />
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
<br />
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
<br />
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
<br />
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
<br />
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
<br />
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
<br />
Mobius.
<br />
<br />Harmonic Sonic
<br />
Writer: David Villaire
<br />
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
<br />
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
<br />
booster to reach and destroy it.
<br />
<br />Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
<br />
Writer: Janis Diamond
<br />
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
<br />
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
<br />
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
<br />
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
<br />
mistake at the end of the second season?
<br />
<br />Sub-Sonic
<br />
Writer: Barbara Slade
<br />
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
<br />
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
<br />
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
<br />
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.
<br />
<br />Heads or Tails
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
<br />
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
<br />
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
<br />
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
<br />
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
<br />
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.
<br />
<br />Sonic Past Cool
<br />
Writers: Kayte Kuch &amp; Sheryl Scarborough
<br />
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
<br />
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
<br /><br />Sonic Racer
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
<br />
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
<br />
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
<br />
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
<br />
generator.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Second Season: 1994-95
<br />
<br />Game Guy
<br />
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
<br />
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
<br />
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
<br />
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
<br />
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
<br />
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
<br />
about a list of other freedom fighters.
<br />
<br />Sonic Conversion
<br />
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
<br />
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
<br />
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
<br />
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
<br />
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
<br />
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
<br />
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
<br />
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
<br />
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.
<br />
<br />No Brainer
<br />
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
<br />
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
<br />
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
<br />
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.
<br />
<br />Blast to the Past (two parts)
<br />
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
<br />
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
<br />
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
<br />
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
<br />
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
<br />
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
<br />
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
<br />
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
<br />
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
<br />
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
would not get captured.
<br />
<br />Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
<br />
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made &quot;king&quot;
<br />
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
<br />
&quot;honor&quot; of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
<br />
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
<br />
ineptitude.
<br />
<br />Dulcy
<br />
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
<br />
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
<br />
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
<br />
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
<br />
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
<br />
time to hatch the egg.
<br />
<br />The Void
<br />
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the &quot;Great
<br />
Unknown&quot; [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
<br />
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
<br />
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
<br />
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
<br />
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
<br />
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
<br />
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
<br />
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
<br />
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
<br />
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
<br />
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
<br />
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
<br />
her the list of other resistance groups.  Sally goes through the
<br />
emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.
<br />
<br />The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
<br />
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
<br />
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
<br />
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
<br />
for Antoine.
<br />
<br />Cry of the Wolf
<br />
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
<br />
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
<br />
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
<br />
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
<br />
a lightning storm and destroys it.
<br />
<br />Drood Henge
<br />
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
<br />
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
<br />
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
<br />
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
<br />
can get to it.
<br />
<br />Spyhog
<br />
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
<br />
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
<br />
back underground with a different cover.
<br />
<br />Doomsday
<br />
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
<br />
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
<br />
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
<br />
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
<br />
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
<br />
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
<br />
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
<br />
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
<br />
season (see FAQ #9).
