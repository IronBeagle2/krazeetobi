<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was well into the Great Forest by now and was thinking of where
<br />
to go next when he heard something behind him.  He ignored it, forcing
<br />
himself to believe it was just a small animal--he WAS in a forest.  Back to
<br />
the problem of where to go next.  Maybe he'd go to back to his village and
<br />
take what he could from what was left of it.  Or maybe he'd--  He heard the
<br />
sound again.  There was definitely something following him.  Ideas raced
<br />
through his mind.  A huge, carnivorous animal?  An army of Swat-bots?  He
<br />
took out his computer and scanned behind him to see what it was.  A small
<br />
fox?  He turned around.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hellooooo...&quot; he called out.  &quot;C'mon out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails stepped out from behind the bush.  He was where the action is after
<br />
all.  Williams sat down at the base of a tree and groaned.  Tails ran over
<br />
and sat down next to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're that kid from Knothole, right?&quot; Williams started the conversation,
<br />
not looking at Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep.  I'm Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned again.  &quot;You can't be here, not after what just
<br />
happened.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why not?  Did you really tell Robotnik where Knothole is?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, well...no.  I didn't TELL him, I just sent him my location.  He
<br />
probably just ignored it.&quot;  A moment of silence.  &quot;I'm not evil, but the rest
<br />
of Knothole certainly thinks so.  Which is why you can't be here.  They're
<br />
probably looking for you and think I kidnapped you.  Why ARE you here
<br />
anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wanted to see where you were going.  Why can't you live with us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, besides the fact that nobody would let me, there's always the fact
<br />
that if I lived with you, that would mean I'd be on your side and against
<br />
Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you on Robotnik's side?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.  How can I explain?  I'm not for Robotnik, but I'm not against him
<br />
either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you're neutral.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nnnnno.  Neutral implies not getting involved.  And I'm really involved
<br />
now.&quot;  There was a short moment of silence after which Williams stood up,
<br />
looked down at Tails, and said, &quot;I'll be leaving now, you'll have to go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But I wanna come with you,&quot; said Tails, also standing up.  &quot;You're almost
<br />
as cool as Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll take that as a complement.&quot;  More silence.  &quot;You can come, but if
<br />
anything happens, just do as I say and everything will be all right.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They started their journey to the Great Swamp.  Not five minutes later,
<br />
they were attacked.  Williams was knocked in the back of the head by a large
<br />
branch and fell to the ground, stunned for now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he came to, he realized what had happened.  He was sitting up against
<br />
a tree with his hands tied behind his back and saw Tails against another tree
<br />
across from him, also apparently tied.  A seemingly tall woman approached him
<br />
with a laser rifle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're awake.  Good.  Get up, both of you.  We're going to the Great
<br />
Swamp.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both got up.  Williams was the first to talk.  &quot;Who--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut up.  Questions will be answered when we get there.  You will lead
<br />
the way.  Try anything and you will die.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they walked, Williams was trying to think of when everything went
<br />
wrong.  Three days ago, everything was fine.  Then they were attacked.  He
<br />
was taken prisoner and spent the night in a cell.  The next night, he was
<br />
interrogated.  Then the escape and the night was spent in an air duct.  He
<br />
was found and captured the next morning, which is when Sonic rescued him.
<br />
Then came the Knothole incident and afterwards he found Tails.  Now he's
<br />
being led to the Great Swamp by a woman with a gun trained on him and is
<br />
responsible for a young fox's safety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All in all, it's been a pretty good day,&quot; he said to himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No talking,&quot; came the woman's voice from behind him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's not in Knothole,&quot; reported Sonic.  &quot;I've searched everywhere.&quot;  The
<br />
group had, once again, met in the War Room to try to solve this mess.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then Williams must have kidnapped him,&quot; said Sally.  &quot;I knew he was a spy
<br />
from Robotropolis!  I bet 'Williams' isn't even his real name!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know,&quot; explained Bookshire.  &quot;If he's with Robotnik, why did
<br />
Robotnik capture him, and why did he black out the city?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If he isn't with Robotnik, why did he give us away?&quot; Sonic brought up a
<br />
good point.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was all just an act.  Robotnik's probably sitting in his chair
<br />
laughing, knowing he has us right where he wants us,&quot; assumed Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then let's find out,&quot; suggested Bookshire.  &quot;I'll just check his main
<br />
computer core to see if there's anything about Williams or Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were off to Bookshire's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; ordered Bookshire, &quot;access the Robotropolis Main Computer Core
<br />
using Cryptosmasher software.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access granted,&quot; reported the computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scan the entire core for anything about the name 'Williams.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scanning.........  No files found.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scan for anything about Tails being captured.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scanning.........  No files found.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scan for anything about relating to a prisoner that escaped yesterday.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scanning.........  One file found.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Show me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access denied.  Level four security clearance required.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Forge it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access granted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The file was displayed.  Bookshire read it and summarized it for the rest
<br />
of the group.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Basically, it confirms the story that a prisoner was captured in a raid
<br />
and escaped interrogation, the same prisoner that Sonic rescued.  This was
<br />
level four, I don't think it's fake.  Williams is not on Robotnik's side.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then why would he kidnap Tails?&quot; Sally still wanted to know.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe he didn't, but whatever the case, we need to find Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Agreed.  Sonic, you search Robotropolis, Dulcy, you and I will search the
<br />
Great Forest.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a long while before they finally made it to their destination and
<br />
they were all tired.  Williams and Tails sat down and got as comfortable as
<br />
they could, considering their condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How about untying us now?  If we try to escape, you can kill us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails immediately looked at Williams at the sound of being shot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay,&quot; he said to Tails, &quot;just don't try to escape and she won't
<br />
kill you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was unsure about this plan.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deal,&quot; the woman said.  She walked over to Tails, crouched down, and
<br />
untied his hands, being careful not to let Williams out of her sight.  Tails,
<br />
in turn, made his way to Williams and untied his hands.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who are you?&quot; asked Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The name is Sandra Nightweaver.  I deal in information.  Who are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams looked at Tails, hoping he'd understand, then back at Sandra.
<br />
&quot;I'm Xero, this is Tails, we're Knothole defectors.  Why do you want us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I don't want you, Packbell does.  Strange, he said that you're a
<br />
fugitive of some kind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well I am.  I escaped from my cell, Tails happened to be in the
<br />
same cell as me.  Almost made it to Knothole.  Hey Tails, you okay?...
<br />
Tails?...  Tails!  He's dehydrated!  You can't expect him to walk this far
<br />
without water!  Get him some water!  If he dies, Packbell would be very
<br />
disappointed!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra just stood there.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're good,&quot; noticed Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you want to escape, you haven't got much time left until noon.
<br />
Besides, Packbell doesn't want HIM.&quot;  She aimed the rifle at Tails.  &quot;He's
<br />
expendable.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams stood between her and Tails.  &quot;Uh, yeah.  But right now I'm kinda
<br />
responsible for his life, so if Packbell doesn't want him, why not let him
<br />
go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because he's my prisoner and I don't want to let him go.  Now sit down,
<br />
Zero or One or whatever kind of a stupid name you have.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He obeyed.  &quot;Sigh,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;Must I explain everything?  It's Xero,
<br />
with a 'Xi.'  Not naught.&quot;  A short silence.  &quot;How much is Packbell paying
<br />
you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He gave me this laser rifle and, when the operation is complete, a hover
<br />
unit.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow.  Hover unit.  You do a lot of work for Robotnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't work for Robotnik.  I work for whoever hires me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ohhhhh,&quot; said Williams, nodding.  &quot;So if I give you something better than
<br />
a hover unit, you'll let us go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A long silence.  No one moved, no one talked.  Each of them looked at one
<br />
another, thinking about the situation.  Williams was looking at Tails when he
<br />
realized that Tails had not said a word ever since they were captured in the
<br />
Great Forest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails,&quot; Williams broke the silence, &quot;you okay, for real?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic would've saved us by now.  I'll probably never see Vixie again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vixie?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure Sonic's out looking for us right now.  But everything will be
<br />
fine as soon as Packbell comes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was puzzled about what Williams just said.  It sounded wrong.  &quot;I
<br />
thought Packbell was gonna roboticize us?  That's bad, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not really.  I'll explain.  You and I have the one most important thing
<br />
it takes to win this war: intelligence.  With it, you can do anything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then why are we stuck here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You underestimate me.  Life is just a game.  You only get one, so you
<br />
have to make it as interesting as possible.  This war gives you the chance to
<br />
do that.  When it's over, you can tell your kids all about how you helped win
<br />
it.  Chances are, their lives won't be nearly as exciting as yours.  You may
<br />
not think so, but you're a very lucky person.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU may think it's fun, but I don't.  Not after my parents were
<br />
roboticized.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ha!  I was there when it all started.  Everybody I knew had been
<br />
roboticized.  I narrowly escaped certain doom and lived here, in a village
<br />
near the Great Swamp.  Just three days ago, Packbell found us and took us all
<br />
to Robotropolis.  I was the only one to escape.&quot;  Williams was just getting
<br />
started when he was rudely interrupted by Sandra, who had shot Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!&quot; shouted Williams.  &quot;We had a deal!  You could kill him, but ONLY if
<br />
he was trying to escape!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh shut up!  He's not dead, just stunned.  Your annoying little life
<br />
story was getting to me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You wanted ME to shut up so you shot Tails,&quot; illogically concluded
<br />
Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I couldn't risk killing YOU.  You're the one Packbell wants.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned.  He attended to Tails, who was fine but unconscious.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here.&quot;  Sandra threw Williams her rifle.  &quot;I'll be back,&quot; she said and
<br />
was gone.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing,&quot; reported Sonic as he arrived back in the War Room.  He was the
<br />
last to stop searching.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He HAS to be SOMEWHERE,&quot; said Sally.  &quot;Tails wouldn't just wander off
<br />
alone.  The ONLY explanation is that Robotnik has him somewhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's impossible, Sal.  I checked with Uncle Chuck.  There's nothing
<br />
going on down there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There has to be!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoah, Sal.  You need a nap.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry.  I'm under a lot a stress right now.  First Williams, now
<br />
Tails.  I guess we'll just have to wait and see who finds him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He can take care of himself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I certainly hope so.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In five short minutes, Sandra did indeed come back with a small pouch
<br />
around her neck.  &quot;Some food and water rations,&quot; she said, offering the bag.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I see.  First you try to kill him, then you offer him food.  I guess
<br />
I never will understand the female mind.  You hungry?&quot; he asked Tails,
<br />
opening the bag.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails had regained consciousness, but was still a bit groggy.  He mumbled
<br />
something and held out his hand.  Williams gave him the bag.  Knowing that
<br />
Tails was taken care of, he turned his attention to Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you know you could trust me?&quot;  He handed Sandra her gun back.  &quot;I
<br />
could've escaped when you were gone.  Or I could've shot you just now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Besides being annoying, your little story revealed a lot about yourself.
<br />
I shot Tails to test my theory.  If you were here when I came back, I was
<br />
right.  If not, I didn't get my hover unit.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You still didn't explain how we're going to escape,&quot; asked Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's quite simple, Sandra gives us to Packbell and gets her hover unit.
<br />
We get Packbell to take you back to Knothole.  I let him take me to
<br />
Robotropolis.  Everybody's happy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But...&quot;  Tails was worried.  &quot;You'll be...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be having the time of my life, trust me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trio waited for Commander Packbell to arrive.  And arrive he did.
<br />
Sandra retreated deeper into the swamp, so as not to let Packbell see her.
<br />
Two hover units landed in the middle of their &quot;camp site.&quot;  The pilot of
<br />
Sandra's hover unit, a Swat-bot, got out and escorted the prisoners to the
<br />
transport.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good bye!&quot; Williams called into the swamp, knowing Sandra was there.
<br />
&quot;And have fun!&quot;  He was loaded onto the ship.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know you are there, Sandra,&quot; announced Packbell.  &quot;Here is your hover
<br />
unit.&quot;  He also got into the ship and took off for Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you prepared for the end of your natural life?&quot; Packbell asked
<br />
Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but that doesn't mean it's going to happen.  Computer, scramble the
<br />
Swat-bot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copilot made a few jerky movements, then lay limp in its chair.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow!  How'd you do that?&quot; inquired Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What have you done!?!&quot; asked Packbell, scrambling for a weapon of some
<br />
sort.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing much, I just randomized every bit of information stored in the
<br />
Swat-bot.  Computer, scramble Pack--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!  Wait!&quot;  Packbell seemed frightened for his life--he couldn't find a
<br />
weapon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, stand by to scramble Packbell.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take us to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I knew where Knothole was, I would have seized it long ago.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't talk to the person who has your life in his hands like that.
<br />
Tails, you know where you live, fly us there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't fly a hover unit,&quot; explained Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, here's your chance to learn.  We've got time.  Press some buttons,
<br />
flip some switches, have fun!  It's not like Packbell will even THINK of
<br />
hurting you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails climbed into the front seat, pushing the Swat-bot onto the floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HE will never be able to get us ANYWHERE,&quot; observed Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HE is incredulously intelligent and will learn.  And from now on, you
<br />
will refer to him as 'Supreme Emperor of All Time and Space.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And what shall I call you?  'Lord of Mobius?'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, you may call me Williams.&quot;  The ship suddenly shot forward, then
<br />
stopped.  &quot;Getting anywhere, Emperor?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails giggled.  He liked the feeling of being in control, of having power.
<br />
&quot;Here we go.&quot;  He turned the hover unit around (sharply), then headed towards
<br />
Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The little twit will kill us all,&quot; warned Packbell.  &quot;You cannot just get
<br />
into a hover unit and fly away.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHO will kill us all?&quot; asked Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Supreme Emperor of All Time and Space,&quot; Packbell corrected his
<br />
warning.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very good!  And if he does kill us all, you can blame me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails landed the hover unit right in the middle of town, where everybody
<br />
could see.  As the door opened, a hush fell over the crowd that gathered.
<br />
Tails stepped out and took a bow.  Sally pushed her way through the cheering
<br />
crowd and hugged Tails as hard as she could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was so worried!&quot; she exclaimed with a few tears rolling down her cheek.
<br />
&quot;I'm glad you're back!  Where have you been?  Are you okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were talking, Williams appeared in the doorway.  &quot;Sorry to leave
<br />
so soon, but I have an unscheduled appointment with Robotnik.&quot;  The hover
<br />
unit took off for Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why was he in there?  Why were YOU in there?  Oh, I'm glad you're back!
<br />
What happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was really excited.  &quot;I followed Williams into the Great Forest,
<br />
then we were attacked by Sandra and taken to the Great Swamp.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You were attacked!?!  Did she hurt you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, not until we got to the Great Swamp, then Williams tried to save us
<br />
but it didn't work, so she shot me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My gosh!  She shot you!?!  Are you okay!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep, fine Aunt Sally.  I was only unconscious for a few minutes.  Then
<br />
Packbell came and traded Sandra a hover unit for us, but then Williams let me
<br />
fly the hover unit and made Packbell call me the Supreme Emperor of All Time
<br />
and Space!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This guy's good,&quot; complimented Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But you were shot!  I'll never forgive him!&quot; vowed Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It wasn't his fault, Aunt Sally.  He stood between Sandra and me.  But
<br />
now...&quot;  Tails' tone of voice lowered.  He spoke a bit slower and fought back
<br />
a tear.  &quot;Now he's Packbell's prisoner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean to tell me,&quot; said Sonic in disbelief, &quot;that he got you to fly a
<br />
hover unit with Packbell next to you in the cockpit, and now he's giving
<br />
himself up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He even said he would,&quot; confirmed Tails.  &quot;He said that Sandra got her
<br />
hover unit, I got home, and Packbell got his prisoner.&quot;
<br />

<br />
