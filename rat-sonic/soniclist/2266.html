Visions in the Wind: Transitions
<br />

<br />
by Ed Becerra
<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha woke with a start.  *Whaaa..., Oh!  I must have fallen asleep in
<br />
Davey's chair.  I never realized what a blessing it would be to have the
<br />
pain taken from me.  I've got to find some way to thank Sonia Hedgehog.
<br />
I've lived with this stupid back for so long, I'd forgotten what life was
<br />
like without the pain.  I owe her a lot.  Hmm...  Gotta think of something
<br />
nice to do for her.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached down for his cane.  &quot;I &lt;hack, hack&gt; should take a walk and
<br />
stretch, before I get stiff again.  Besides, I wanna see what Knothole looks
<br />
like.  Seems like a pretty place.  I should get to know it better.  If Old
<br />
Man is right, I'm going to be here for some time.  Guess it's going to be my
<br />
home, for a while.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He walked out the door, carefully shutting it behind him.  *I'm Davey's
<br />
guest.  Behoves me to be thoughtful.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late day sun shone brightly, reminding Kickaha of his native prairie.
<br />
He felt a little homesick.  All those trees, so close together!  And the
<br />
grass.  It was green, not the proper brown buffalo grass of home.  Nor was
<br />
it nearly tall enough.  He looked around.  Not a yucca plant or prickly pear
<br />
cactus to be seen.  He sighed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This had better be worth it, Old Man.  You know I don't belong here.
<br />
Ain't natural.  I belong to the Rockies and the Plains.  Coyotes just ain't
<br />
made for civilization.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wandered around Knothole, greeting the inhabitants, and learning the
<br />
village layout.  As he drifted through the streets, he happened to pass by
<br />
Princess Sally's place.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Kickaha!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, hello, Princess!  I didn't see you there.  Is there anything I can
<br />
do for you?&quot; Kickaha asked.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not right now.  But there IS something we can do for you.  We're getting
<br />
together some volunteers to put up a hut for you.  I know you're having
<br />
trouble with your back right now, so you don't have to join in, if you don't
<br />
want to.&quot; Sally smiled at him.  But she didn't get the response she
<br />
expected.  Kickaha was shaking his head frantically.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aahhhh...  No, no, no thank you, Princess.  Don't put yourself out.
<br />
I'll find someplace in the forest to den up in.  Don't trouble yourself.  No
<br />
problem.  Don't really need a hut.  Everything's okay.  Really.  Yeah.
<br />
Don't need a hut...&quot; All of this was coming out at a high-speed babble that
<br />
surprised Sally.  Kickaha was backing away from her as though he'd just seen
<br />
Robotnik rise from the grave.  Suddenly, he turned and ran.  She could see
<br />
from his awkward stride how it hurt him to run that quickly.  But why was he
<br />
running?  And from what?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She watched as he stopped just inside the edge of the forest, and leaned
<br />
against a tree, propped up by his cane, panting.  Something was wrong here,
<br />
she thought.  But what?  It didn't seem like a case of Outsider mood.  At
<br />
least, not one she was familiar with.  He seemed...  afraid.  But of a hut?
<br />
She turned to look for Nicole.  Perhaps the computer might have the answers
<br />
she needed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the edge of the forest...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A-huh, a-huh, a-huh...&quot; panted Kickaha.  *Oh, yeah* he thought, *behave
<br />
like some savage from the wilderness.  Smooth move, stupid.* He shuddered,
<br />
and sat down suddenly at the base of the tree.  *Oh, Fortuna, I didn't think
<br />
it would hit me that quickly!  What am I going to do?  What am I going to
<br />
tell them?  That I _can't_ live inside Knothole?  They'll think me
<br />
ungrateful.  Or even a spy for Snively.  I don't know what to do!  Help me,
<br />
Great Spirit!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His breathing eased, and his panic subsided, but his worry remained.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At Princess Sally's hut...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cute girl bobcat was speaking with Sally.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's not a great deal in the database about the Wild Pack tribes,
<br />
Princess, and what is there dates from before the Great War and Robotnik's
<br />
coup.  What I have found does seem to answer your question, however.  You
<br />
said he seemed to panic when you mentioned putting up a hut for him?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's right,&quot; answered Sally.  &quot;Until then, he seemed all right.  But
<br />
when I brought up the matter of the hut, he began to shiver, then ran into
<br />
the forest.  He stopped running once he reached the edge, though.  The last
<br />
I saw of him, he was sitting beneath a tree, shaking violently.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... Demophobia ...&quot; said Nicole.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;An unreasoning fear of being surrounded by crowds of people.  It seems
<br />
that the coyote tribes share a great deal with their unevolved kin.  Like
<br />
them, the coyote people form loose, widely spread family groups, with only a
<br />
few in each pack.  They prefer to live underground, in burrows dug into the
<br />
sides of small hills.  And they feel extremely uncomfortable when surrounded
<br />
by large numbers of people.  In many cases, as time passes, this feeling
<br />
becomes demophobia.  In fact, many coyotes become hermits.&quot; Nicole blinked.
<br />
&quot;From your description, Princess, I'd say he's having an unusually strong
<br />
reaction to the number of people living in Knothole.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is there anything we can do to help him?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, moving him as close as possible to the edge of the village would
<br />
help.  The fewer the people near to him, the better.  And we should try to
<br />
make him feel at home.  The unfamiliar setting of Knothole is probably what
<br />
triggered his panic attack.  The Great Forest looks nothing like the High
<br />
Prairies that were his home.  There is very little here that would seem
<br />
familiar to him.&quot; Nicole told her.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Familiar settings.  Hmm...  Nicole, you wouldn't happen to have any
<br />
pictures of what a typical coyote burrow looks like?  Or any descriptions 
<br />
of them?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Checking...  There are several descriptions, and a few sketches of a
<br />
traditional coyote lodge that were made by a researcher from the University
<br />
of Mobotropolis before the Great War.  The paper he wrote contains them,
<br />
along with brief descriptions of how it was furnished and what living in one
<br />
was like.&quot; Nicole looked at Sally.  &quot;They are somewhat dated.  But they are
<br />
the best I can come up with.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  They'll do.  Print out several copies.  I've got to go speak with
<br />
Rotor.  I think I have a solution to this.&quot; Sally turned and headed to
<br />
Rotor's workshop.  &quot;When you've got the copies made, bring them to me.  I'll
<br />
be at Rotor's place.  And see if Dulcy's available.  I'd like to talk with
<br />
her.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An hour later, a nervous coyote wandered back into Knothole, headed for
<br />
Davey Crockett's hut.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Maybe if I get a good night's sleep, I can deal with this.  But I really
<br />
dread the thought of having to explain things to Princess Sally.  She's
<br />
gonna think I'm the most ungrateful cur since...  since...  Fortuna!  I
<br />
can't _think_ of anyone that ungrateful!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he walked toward the hut, Bear caught up with him.  &quot;Hey there,
<br />
Kickaha!  How are you?  Feeling any better?  Sally said you were having a
<br />
few problems settling in.  Nothing serious, I hope.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh..  Yeah..  Right..  Nothing serious.  Just a little nervous, a new
<br />
setting, far away from home, all that stuff.  Yeah.  That's it.  No big
<br />
deal.&quot; Kickaha chattered.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear could see how nervous the coyote seemed.  Maybe...  Yes.  He touched
<br />
the coyote on the shoulder.  &quot;Don't worry about it.  Besides, I hear
<br />
Princess Sally has something she wants to show you tomorrow morning.  I
<br />
understand that your folk are nocturnal, so you might want to get some rest.
<br />
Sunrise comes pretty early in the morning around here.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right.  You're right.  I need sleep.  Yeah.  That's the ticket.
<br />
Sleep.  Good idea.  Good night.&quot; Despite his fur and the warmth of the
<br />
evening, Kickaha was shivering.  He went inside the hut and went straight to
<br />
bed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bear turned toward his own hut.  *He's having a hard time with this.  If
<br />
there ever was a born hermit, he's one.  I hope Sally's idea works.
<br />
Otherwise, his only hope is to live out in the forest, like Sandra
<br />
Nightweaver.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the morning sun shone through the windows of Davey's hut, it lit up
<br />
the cot Kickaha lay upon.  The coyote wasn't sleeping easily.  He was
<br />
twitching and growling in his sleep.  Every now and then, he let out a small
<br />
snarl.  Davey noticed this, but thought it best to leave him be for the
<br />
moment.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I'll just let him sleep for now.  If he doesn't wake up before breakfast
<br />
is over, then I'll get him up myself.  I wouldn't want him to miss Sally's
<br />
surprise.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After eating, Davey headed back to his hut, carrying a tray of food for
<br />
Kickaha.  He set it down on a table, and looked over at the cot.  He was
<br />
still asleep, and still dreaming.  Davey went to shake him by the shoulder.
<br />
To his surprise, he was almost bitten for his trouble.  Kickaha snarled and
<br />
snapped at him without even opening his eyes.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;RAAAGGGHHH!!  YOU BAST...  Oh, Fortuna!  Oh, David!  I'm sorry!  So
<br />
sorry!  I thought...  I didn't realize...  oh, crud.&quot; Kickaha put a paw to
<br />
his head.  He had a mortified expression on his face.  &quot;Ah, gods, I'm so
<br />
sorry.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bad dreams, huh?  Ah been there myself, once or twice.  Must be pretty
<br />
bad if you wake up in a kill-without-warning kinda mood.  Wanna talk about
<br />
it sometime?  It can help, to have a friend to share the load.&quot; Davey smiled
<br />
at him.  &quot;I've had good friends here help me get through my problems.  They
<br />
can help you, too.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know if I have that right, David.  I don't want to lay my guilt
<br />
on anyone.  No one deserves that.&quot; Kickaha was silent for a moment.  A look
<br />
of ancient sorrow crossed his face.  &quot;No one but me.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey now, Kicker!  Ah thought I was the one carrying around all the blame
<br />
around here.  After all, Sally's been constantly telling me nobody blames me
<br />
for being a Kintobor.  Quit tryin' ta hog all the guilt, guy.&quot; Davey put a
<br />
paw on Kickaha's shoulder.  &quot;These are good folk, here.  They'll help you if
<br />
you let them.  Now eat some breakfast.  I got a surprise to show you when
<br />
you're done.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that?  A hut?&quot; Kickaha started to shiver slightly.  &quot;I don't need
<br />
a hut, I really don't, I can live out in the forest...&quot; He'd begun to
<br />
chatter again.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Naw, no hut.  Something different.  It wouldn't be a surprise if I told
<br />
what it was, now would it?  You just eat up.  Don't want to keep Princess
<br />
Sally waiting, do ya?&quot; David pushed him over to the table and sat him down
<br />
in front of the breakfast tray.  &quot;Besides, Nicole told us 'bout your
<br />
`problem'.  Seems it's a coyote kind of thing.  Don't worry about it.  We
<br />
can handle it together.  Now EAT, already!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;***
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Breakfast had been finished, and Kickaha and David were walking toward
<br />
the Power Ring Pool.  Kickaha was becoming more curious by the second.  As
<br />
they'd walked, he noted that Knothole seemed rather quiet.  He hadn't seen
<br />
anyone in the streets.  Something was going on, but what?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they reached the pool, David turned off towards a small trail that
<br />
led off through the underbrush on the far side of the small pool.  &quot;Come on,
<br />
Kicker.  It's this way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's this way?!  Come on, Dave!  If you leave me hanging like this for
<br />
much longer, I swear I'm gonna sneak up on you tonight and super-glue your
<br />
mechanical arm to your cot!  I KNOW where you live.  I KNOW where you sleep.
<br />
AND I know where I can get a few thousand Nerf bricks, real cheap!&quot; Kickaha
<br />
threatened.  Davey laughed at that.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha wasn't feeling as nasty as he sounded, though.  The further they
<br />
got into the forest around Knothole, the better he felt.  He knew why, too.
<br />
*It may not be the High Prairie, but at least there aren't many people here.
<br />
It's quiet and lonely, just like home.* Something deep inside him unknotted
<br />
and relaxed.  He let out a deep sigh of contentment.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Almost there, Kick.&quot; Davey was a few feet ahead of him, and the cyberfox
<br />
was a foot or so taller than he was, to begin with.  Kickaha couldn't see
<br />
past him.  And jumping up to see over him seemed a little undignified.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here we are!  Take a good look, Kicker.  Tell us what you think!&quot; Davey
<br />
had an ear to ear grin.  (Which is something to see on a fox.)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They'd just come upon a small clearing.  From the looks of it, a large
<br />
tree had fallen, years ago, and knocked down a number of others.  Running
<br />
along side of the clearing's edge was a tiny stream.  Near the center stood
<br />
Sally, Rotor, Bookshire, Dulcy and a number of others.  they were standing
<br />
next to what seemed to be a large hole in the ground.  There was a large
<br />
pile of cut sod nearby.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha could hear Rotor saying, &quot;No, no, the fire pit goes in the center
<br />
of the Great Room, not to the side.  The sleeping cabinets are what go on
<br />
the sides.  And remember to lay the granite tiles in the fire pit, first.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha's jaw dropped.  He couldn't believe what he was seeing.  He
<br />
walked forward.  It was real.  &quot;Whaaa...  How...  Why...  This...  this
<br />
looks just like the lodge of Three Young Buffalo.  How did you...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally laughed.  &quot;Nicole told us what the trouble was, and she had
<br />
pictures of the sort of home you were used to living in.  All we had to do
<br />
was find a small clearing on the edge of the village.  Tails had seen this
<br />
one from the air, and Sonic checked it out.  Near enough to be safe, and far
<br />
enough away for a coyote.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor turned toward him.  &quot;We don't have enough sod to cover the entire
<br />
burrow, but the mages all say that a spell to make grass seed grow fast is
<br />
an easy thing to do.  It'll be ready to live in by the day after tommorrow.
<br />
Within the week, it will look just like the pictures Nicole found.  Two
<br />
weeks from now, you won't be able to tell it from any other small grassy
<br />
hill.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I..  I..  I don't know what to say.  I don't know how I can repay
<br />
you...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just do what you can to help overthrow Robotropolis and further the
<br />
cause of freedom, Kickaha.  That's all anyone needs to do.&quot; Sally told him.
<br />
&quot;Oh, don't forget to schedule an appointment with Sir Charles.  You need to
<br />
take care of that back.  Remember what I said about people who wouldn't
<br />
listen to good advice?&quot; With that, she shot Davey another one of her
<br />
_looks_.  He flinched, and held up both paws.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be good, Sally, honest I will!&quot; Davey whined.  &quot;I promise!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally humphed.  &quot;You'd better.  Or I'll set Sonia on you.  And you know
<br />
_SHE_ won't take any excuses from you.&quot; At that, Davey went white under his
<br />
fur.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now it was Kickaha's turn to laugh.  &quot;Looks like she's got you by the
<br />
shorts, good buddy.  I'd advise a quick surrender before it's too late.
<br />
After all, you know females never take prisoners.  I thought you knew that.&quot;
