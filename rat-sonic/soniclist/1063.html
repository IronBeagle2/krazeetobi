Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like he wants to

around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from falling into
<br />
a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;

<br />
================================================================
<br />

<br />
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
<br />
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
<br />
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
<br />
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
<br />
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
<br />
there is no &quot;official&quot; explanation as to how Tails got that way,
<br />
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
<br />
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
<br />
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
<br />
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
<br />
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
<br />
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
<br />
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
<br />
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
<br />
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
<br />
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
<br />
Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
<br />
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
<br />
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
<br />
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
<br />
Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series
<br />
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
<br />
indicate that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative
<br />
differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally miniseries began
<br />
shipping the week of Feb 13.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
<br />
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about &quot;The
<br />
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
<br />
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />
like:
<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
<br />
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
<br />
Plausible and has the facts on its side: after the November sweeps, ABC
<br />
moved StH to 8:00 am (Eastern) so it was opposite &quot;Dog City&quot; on Fox.
<br />
But just in time for the February sweeps, Fox shifted MMPR to 8:00.
<br />
More effective than any Doomsday device, unfortunately.
<br />
Source for this
<br />
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics, as posted
<br />
to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
<br />
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
<br />
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
<br />
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
<br />
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
<br />
you say &quot;anal retentive&quot;?).  Words were exchanged and the show
<br />
was effectively cancelled.
<br />
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
<br />
of &quot;two seasons and out&quot; for shows.  Though it's possible that
<br />
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
<br />
to begin with.
