[Note: Funny, I'd have thought someone else would have commented on this
<br />
issue by now.  Oh,well.  Spoilers ahead, yadda yadda yadda...]
<br />

<br />
#32 [March 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover art: Pat Spaziante seems to be making his mark as a cover
<br />
artist, and a dynamic one at that.  And he continues to push the outside
<br />
of the envelope in his drawings of Sally.  Talk about a tail to
<br />
astonish....!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Blast From The Past&quot; (3 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo DeCesare/Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
The Knothole Freedom Fighters are somewhere in the mountains when
<br />
they're attacked by SWATbots.  One of them gets off a laser shot that
<br />
severs the rope that Sally has been climbing.  She begins to fall to her
<br />
doom....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and this is just the first panel!  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails catches Sally on the fly as the freedom fighters make
<br />
their escape.  However, they run into other SWATbots with a
<br />
robodog...which just happens to be Sonic's old pet, Muttski.  However,
<br />
the impending attack is broken off by Uncle Chuck using a device that
<br />
looks like a remote control for a toy car.  Antoine then tumbles into a
<br />
gorge where he discovers...  I'm sorry, but Mawhinney's talent totally
<br />
fails to make his rendition of a frozen prehistoric &quot;Mobian bear&quot; very
<br />
convincing--especially when compared with his rendition of a polar bear
<br />
later in this issue.  The two don't look anything alike.  The
<br />
prehistoric bear (dubbed &quot;Mobie&quot; by Tails) looks more like a hulked-out
<br />
version of that obnoxious animal from the Honeycomb cereal commercials
<br />
on TV (note to overseas readers who don't get American TV: you're not
<br />
missing a thing!).  Rotor suggests that they take Mobie back to Knothole
<br />
to revive him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic accidentally causes a speedup in the thawing process and Mobie
<br />
promptly begins running amok.  Bunnie trees Mobie until he calms down.
<br />
Anti-Mobie sentiment begins to grow (Antoine: &quot;He is ze librarian!&quot;
<br />
Sally : &quot;I think you mean 'barbarian,' Antoine.&quot;  Just for the record
<br />
I'M the librarian, and I have the Master's degree in library science to
<br />
prove it!  But enough about me....).  Bunnie, however, tries using
<br />
pictures to communicate with Mobie; since he was holding a paint brush
<br />
in one hand when he was found, she thinks he may have an artistic side.
<br />
Mobie takes one look at the group drawing of Bunnie's, has a dim memory
<br />
of his own family unit, and runs away from Knothole to look for them.
<br />
Sonic gives chase, reluctantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding Mobie by a nearby mountain surrounded by SWATbots, Sonic
<br />
comes to his rescue.  Mobie returns the favor when Sonic manages to
<br />
knock himself out and almost gets chomped by Muttski.  Snoic has to do
<br />
some quick drawing in the dirt before Mobie tries taking Muttski apart.
<br />
The story is wrapped up in short order: Muttski's mind is restored and
<br />
Mobie is dropped off in a Mobian jungle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty good action yarn hampered by an unbelievable &quot;cave bear.&quot;  I
<br />
suppose by making bears the sapient species instead of primates,
<br />
evolution on Mobius took a different turn.  But I'll leave that to the
<br />
theoreticians on the list -- I'm a Mobian creationist myself ;-) .
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Prisoners&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet another 2-page installment in the Chinese water torture that is
<br />
being passed off as a Knuckles story.  Espio, Charmy, Mighty and Vector
<br />
are trapped somewhere and encounter a shadowy figure wearing the same
<br />
digger-style hat as Knack the Weasel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tundra Road&quot; Part 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We left Rotor sinking to his doom in the waters of the North Sea.
<br />
One other fan has summed up the situation best: we know Rotor will be
<br />
saved; the question is, will his rescue be as contrived as Tails' rescue
<br />
from the roboticizer in &quot;Growing Pains, Part 2&quot;?  As it turns out, Rotor
<br />
is indeed saved by two of the polar Mobians left over from &quot;Way Way Past
<br />
Cool&quot; (Sonic #26): Sealia the seal (who didn't have any lines the first
<br />
time but who has now acquired a copy of Antoine's dimestore French
<br />
accent) and Augustus the polar bear.  Using a literal Trojan horse
<br />
gambit, Rotor and the two polar Mobians invade the ice cave where the
<br />
walrus herd is still gathered, but Robotnik orders the brainwashed herd
<br />
to destroy Rotor.  The polar Mobians separate Rotor from the herd by
<br />
setting the herd adrift on an ice floe.  Rotor vows to return to release
<br />
the herd from Robotnik's influence...if the zombified herd doesn't die
<br />
of starvation in the meantime.  Oh well, at least Manak took a break
<br />
from doing the artwork.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic grams: same old office humor.  Hype for Super Sonic v.
<br />
Hyper-Knuckles special issue (story by Gallagher *ack!*/art by
<br />
Mawhinney).  One letter concerns Sonic's sneakers and there's some
<br />
teasing of Knuckles' story in issues 33-36.
<br />
