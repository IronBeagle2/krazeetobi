As I understand it, he was mostly (more than Bunnie) but not totally 
<br />
roboticized.

<br />
Cmdr. Data isn't the only one.  In the movie &quot;Not Quite Human&quot;, the boy 
<br />
robot can eat, too.  But his &quot;stomach&quot; is merely a garbage disposal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; not be used to support Mobius being a future Earth.  For one thing, it

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; oblivion and the Earth started over with other animals (after all, doesn't

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the sun have about 5 billion years of life left?), which use a date system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on an event other than Christ's birth (the Second Coming, perhaps? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well...let's not get into Mobian religion just yet :-)...)  But then how
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would one go about explaining the many things that just happened to appear
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; once again?  Chili dogs?  France?  The English and French languages?  And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what about the magic of Mobius, such as the Time Stones or 'The Void'? 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Also hard to explain in a future Earth.
</em><br />

<br />
Our sun does have several billion years left.  But if Mobius is not a 
<br />
future earth, it can't be in our solar system.  No other planet in our 
<br />
planet can support such living things.  I did once before post that 
<br />
Mobius could be using a different date system; some cultures on Earth do 
<br />
too.  But we don't know what event was designated as Year 0 or 1 (where 
<br />
did they begin numbering?).  As for religion on Mobius, I've seen no 
<br />
clear indication what, if any, religion(s) is/are practiced there.  It is 
<br />
possible that they could develop chili dogs without any knowledge of 
<br />
Earth (but not necessarily exactly like ours), but duplication of the 
<br />
French language, culture, and planetary region is highly unlikely.  I 
<br />
would agree that the Time Stones and Deep Power Stones would be hard to 
<br />
explain for a future Earth.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still say that Mobius exists in a universe parallel in many ways to our
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; own, and that Mobius is the Earth of that universe.  I'm currently working
</em><br />

<br />
Not necessarily another universe.  The explored area of our universe is 
<br />
already thought to be much smaller than the entirety of our universe.  
<br />
Data gathered from the &quot;outer edges&quot; is millions, even billions, of years 
<br />
old by the time it is received here, and we cannot predict what is in 
<br />
those places right now.  The laws of physics might be different in other 
<br />
parts of the universe.  Not different in a random way, but different in 
<br />
some scientifically explainable way if only we had the needed 
<br />
information.
