<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elsewhere, the hedgehog in question discovered what had
<br />
happened.  And was indulging himself in a litany of unusually
<br />
imaginative curses.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As though you had lost anything of import.  You had a few
<br />
coppers, and single silver, true?  And you're about to receive
<br />
fifteen royals-- gold royals at that.  By Mosthe', we'll even throw
<br />
in a new purse.&quot;  Bunnie looked at the incensed barbarian with ill-
<br />
concealed amusement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not the point, Bent-ear.  Someone stole from ME-- Me, Son-Ak
<br />
of the Cad-Hai, the swift one, the runner, the--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The compulsive whiner about trifles.  &quot;Now, hold your tongue
<br />
and your temper.  The princess isn't impressed with either brags or
<br />
curses.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak grudgingly complied.  He was not looking forward to
<br />
meeting this city-princess, no doubt some homely inbred noblewoman
<br />
with an inflated ego and a temper to match, with few wits and no
<br />
forethought, and almost certainly--
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he was ushered into the audience hall by Bunnie, and for
<br />
a moment, Son-Ak, the swift, the runner, the warrior, forgot to
<br />
breathe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar-Alicia, Princess of House Acorn, was a slender, well
<br />
formed ground squirrel.  A mane of red-brown hair was contrasted by
<br />
eyes of a deep, almost hypnotic green.  Dressed in white silks with
<br />
gold trim, (and frankly, not a great deal of them)  white sandals,
<br />
and a simple tiara of office, she was simply the most beautiful
<br />
creature Son-AK had ever seen.  (And when you're a travelling
<br />
barbarian adventurer , who spends most of his non-combat time in
<br />
taverns and bars, with the requisite scantily-clad exotic dancing
<br />
girls, you see a lot of beautiful creatures.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the warrior you spoke of, Captain?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The warrior-bunny stepped forward, and knelt.  &quot;Yes, my
<br />
Princess.  Three of Roboth-amon's iron men smashed by him.  I
<br />
thought you would like to see such a marvel.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Indeed.&quot;  Salar-Alicia rose from the couch she had been lying
<br />
on, and strode over to the dumbstruck hedgehog.  &quot;You hadn't
<br />
mentioned that he was so handsome, though.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-ak just stood, transfixed at the proximity of the girl of
<br />
his dreams before him.  Something inside him clamored for him to
<br />
say something-- anything-- and in horror he heard himself say,
<br />
&quot;Aren't those clothes drafty?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar-Alicia blinked.  And then began to giggle.  &quot;And he's
<br />
witty too!&quot;  She fell back onto the couch, laughing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie Rabbot was at that moment thinking very hard about
<br />
throwing herself on her sword.  _Idiot barbarian..._
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak was thinking similar thoughts... but realized that axes
<br />
were impractical for such actions.  _Maybe I can borrow bent-ear's
<br />
sword..._
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess/ mirth wound to a stop.  &quot;Oh, well... Warrior,
<br />
when you are a princess, there are certain expectations that the
<br />
people have of you.  They expect me to be beautiful and alluring,
<br />
and unapproachable.  Besides, if you can pull it off, why not?  I
<br />
admit that this style of dress may not be practical, but I do not
<br />
need to be practical.&quot;  She sighed, and added, &quot;Once I am Queen,
<br />
then I move into gowns and gold.  Tradition is a complex thing...
<br />
And I am bound by it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; replied Son-Ak.  &quot;Well... um... you wear it well.
<br />
Royalty, I mean, not the... AH, that is, you...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar-Alicia grinned.  &quot;Bunnie, when are you going to
<br />
introduce me to a male that doesn't react like this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rabbit sighed,&quot; When you gain twenty-five pounds and start
<br />
wearing a grain sack. &quot;  She stood, and grinned.  &quot;But it's a
<br />
fairly effective defense, I suppose, throwing a possible opponent
<br />
off guard.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess frowned.  &quot;Must you see everything in terms of
<br />
defense or offense?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Zat is 'er duty, Highness.  As mine is to protect you in
<br />
making ze spells, nest pas'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak turned to meet the new voice.  The vulpine stood
<br />
unimpressed, clad in a long elaborate robe, with a tangled mane of
<br />
gold hair falling about his shoulders.  He carried a staff of
<br />
gnarled oak, and an expression of hauteur that almost immediately
<br />
antagonized the hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah.  The other of my closest aides.  Son-Ak, meet Antos, my
<br />
personal sorcerer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antos looked at Son-Ak with undisguised disdain, which changed
<br />
to suspicion.  &quot;Princess.  Zat is the magic I am sensing.&quot;  He
<br />
pointed to the hedgehog.  &quot;Zat... person, he is stinking of magic.
<br />
He is enchanted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak growled.  &quot;Enchanted, spell-weaver?  There's no magic
<br />
in me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antos walked over to the barbarian, and sniffed.  Before
<br />
Son-Ak could react, he nodded.  &quot;Non.  Not you, but ze axe.  Zat
<br />
axe is ze magical blade.&quot;  He walked away, muttering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie sighed, &quot;Never mind Antos, Son-Ak.  He's a sorcerer.
<br />
All sorcerers are a bit peculiar.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak stood bewildered.  &quot;My axe is magic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess smiled.  &quot;If Antos says it is, then it is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The barbarian hesitated.  &quot;Bah.  That spellweaver's nose is
<br />
broken.  I've no magic, and neither has this blade.&quot;  He paused for
<br />
a moment, and suddenly blurted, &quot;And where's my money?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the princess laughed.  &quot;Why, I had almost forgotten.&quot;
<br />
She picked up a small purse, and tossed it to the hedgehog.  Son-Ak
<br />
caught it, and grinned himself at the heavy and satisfying feels of
<br />
gold.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps you will dine with me tonight?  I hear little of the
<br />
world outside Mobius, and should like to hear of your adventures.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And I know he's gonna LOVE to tell you about them,&quot; muttered
<br />
Bunnie under her breath...
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dark clad figure dropped from the windowsill, into the
<br />
shadows.  Scurrying from alley to alley, he made his way to a less
<br />
than reputable tavern, where he climbed the back wall to another
<br />
window, and climbed in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throwing back his hood, he revealed a human face (one of the
<br />
rarer races in the land), sharp, with an almost dagger-like nose
<br />
and a think unruly mane of brown hair.  He reached into a pocket
<br />
hidden in his tunic, and bought out a small, oddly shaped mirror.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Master,&quot; he hissed.  The mirror seemed to ripple for a
<br />
moment, and then to clear, showing the shadowy figure of Roboth-
<br />
amon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Sniv?&quot;  the wizard of the East replied.  &quot;What have you
<br />
found out?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your golems were destroyed by one person, Master.  A
<br />
hedgehog, with an enchanted axe.&quot;  Sniv paused, and added, &quot;A big
<br />
hedgehog.  Blue, a northerner.  And the Princess seems taken with
<br />
him, rather.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A hedgehog.  I've little liking for the idea that my greatest
<br />
plan is to be spoiled by a hedgehog.  Keep spying, Sniv, and keep
<br />
me informed.  Meanwhile, I shall prepare a present for this
<br />
interloper...&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
