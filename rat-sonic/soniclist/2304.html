</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of...well, coolness on a monthly basis.
</em><br />

<br />
I, personally, am not all that intrested in exploring the more intimate 
<br />
aspects of Sonic's and Sally's relationship.  I know there would likely 
<br />
be intimacy if they were live beings and chose to marry each other, but 
<br />
I'll let them enjoy their relationship in the privacy of their bedroom.  
<br />
But my lack of interest does not give me the authority to make up someone 
<br />
else's mind on the subject.  It's OK to suggest an opinion to someone and 
<br />
attempt to sell them on the idea, but don't make their decision for them.
<br />

<br />
I think the original creators' wishes (if known, not second-guessed) 
<br />
should be respected, but you have to remember that the characters are 
<br />
&quot;out there&quot;.  If you're so attached to your character that you can't bear 
<br />
the thought someone might use him/her/hir/it in a way other than what you 
<br />
intended, you should probably reconsider exposing that character to the 
<br />
public.  You can't stop someone from thinking &quot;naughty&quot; thoughts about 
<br />
your character (short of killing them) even if you could stop them from 
<br />
writing or drawing your character into compromising positions.
<br />

<br />
If Sonic's original creators were to speak up and tell us they are 
<br />
repulsed by the &quot;plain brown wrapper&quot; material, those of us who respect 
<br />
their original work need only gather 'round and support the writers and 
<br />
artists who also respect the creators' wishes and spurn those who don't.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The people who made these characters are probably off working on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Virtua Fighter II&quot; or something.  Cut us some slack.
</em><br />

<br />
You're probably right.  Sega isn't really developing Sonic et. al., and 
<br />
DIC certainly isn't.  Archie and Fleetway are, but only at a trickle with 
<br />
a few issues per year and made none easier by difficult international 
<br />
availability of both publishers' books.  Any new books from Troll 
<br />
Associates?  Not that I know of.  If the characters aren't developed  
<br />
by &quot;official&quot; persons to satisfy the fans (read: market), someone is 
<br />
going to come along and do it -- and you can't depend upon third party 
<br />
developers making the same decisions you would when implementing your 
<br />
characters.  The fan writers are sort of in the same league as those who 
<br />
developed Linux, except they write for humans instead of a CPU chip.  And 
<br />
whether it's Sonic or Unix, they're freely offering their time and effort 
<br />
to contribute to a universe (or operating system) not of their original 
<br />
design.  I don't think AT&amp;T (the original creators of Unix) would agree 
<br />
with everything that's been done in Linux  -- especially Linux's price 
<br />
(free).  The fan writers fill in the gaps left by the &quot;orginal&quot; sources 
<br />
just as Linux opens Unix to those who don't want to (or can't) drop 
<br />
hundreds or thousands of dollars for a copy of &quot;real&quot; Unix; both fulfill 
<br />
a need that had not before been satisfied.
