<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Okay, here's what I'VE been wondering: WHAT ARE YOU ANTI-TWISTED METTLE
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PEOPLE ON?!?!?!?!
</em><br />
Uh, NyQuil.  How about you? :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;  YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING IF YOU THINK IT'S OFF-TOPIC!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;...You can post...anything related to the Sonic/Mobius storyline...&quot;  DOES
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; THAT RING A BELL?!
</em><br />
Well, yes, to me it does.  This mailing list was created to talk about the
<br />
story-lines that detail the Sonic universes.  It was my understanding that
<br />
this includes the plot lines of the Saturday morning show, the comics,
<br />
the fan-fic, the weekday afternoon show (if anybody dares :) ), even the
<br />
PLOTs of the Genesis and Game Gear games... but not the game play itself.
<br />

<br />
This, again to my understanding, does NOT include a bunch of messages that
<br />
ask for support on the creation of a game, and a whole bunch of other
<br />
messages detailing what will go into such a game.  If you want to talk about
<br />
the story/plot that surrounds this game, and provided the traffic for such
<br />
doesn't get too out of hand (I've heard that some netters actually have to
<br />
pay for their incoming email), then fine.  But game play suggestions, coding,
<br />
graphics... uh, no, don't think so.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Twisted Mettle is a game based ENTIRELY on the Sat-AM
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Sun-AM now, eh?) cartoon
</em><br />
Just as all of this is based on the Genesis games.  But again, we're not
<br />
talking about them, either.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; therefore HAVE SUBSCRIBED TO THE WRONG LIST!  As for the &quot;large amount of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mail&quot; you're whining about, there was an EQUAL amount when the perv
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; directory (a MUCH less worthy asset) was removed, and no-one complained.
</em><br />
Well, maybe somebody should have. :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you don't see me on the list anymore, I urge you to follow my lead and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsubscribe yourselves.
</em><br />
Nah.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Then, we can start the Twisted Mettle list, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; see how the mail there compares to the sound of crickets chirping over on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this one.  However, if I stay, maybe these maint people AREN'T complete
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fools, and there's hope.  Depends...
</em><br />
&nbsp;Here's hoping the game gets it's own list anyways.  Those who want it
<br />
definitely seem to be that gung-ho about it (yourself included), so a
<br />
mailing list for that would be a good idea.
<br />

<br />
Or maybe you can talk about such things on the alt.fan.sonic newsgroup.
<br />
Such things would be more in-topic there (since, again to my understanding,
<br />
the idea is to talk about ALL things Sonic over there), not to mention it
<br />
might increase the traffic of an otherwise slim-pickings newsgroup.
<br />
