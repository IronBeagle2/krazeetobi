<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to settle the argument, Sally and Sonic were 13 at the commencement, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they're currently 15 right now. The story with Julayla was written just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; aired, as we were working from a script because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed to establish the character of Rosie. As I recall, the time-line wasn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too established in the script we were working from, as the war was only going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on for a couple of years.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We worked out our own timeline as a result, based on SEGA treating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characters as if they aged at the same rate we do. If we treated them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of how animals really age (so many of their years = one of ours), Sonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Sally would've been portrayed as battle-hardened adults by this time. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further proof of this, when we portrayed Sonic and Sally married in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, there were a few comments about how old they should be to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; married.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To go by the timeline that the war started when Sonic and Sally were five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't make sense, especially when you factor in their current age. As far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we were concerned, this was one time when the show got it wrong. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it's TV, most people accept that version as gospel. My attitude is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it's the games that establish the world of Sonic, with the series,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paperbacks and comics filling in the details, with neither one more valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the other. Mike and I tried to be consistent with all versions, but for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various reasons, couldn't always be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mike and I constantly disagree over what happens in the world of Sonic, as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try our best to do the best stories we can. And our approach definitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs from the other writers involved in the series. That doesn't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they're wrong or bad. They just have a different slant on the characters and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So go ahead, enjoy your take on the world of SONIC. Think of Sonic like some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the other classic characters, and how many different versions of Batman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Superman there are. I guess you could chalk it all up to artistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if you ask a question to settle a debate, you're going to get my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation that I work out with the editors at Archie and the licensing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; department at SEGA, okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Kenokay, I just thought that someone should mention that if history was the 
</em><br />
subject, that's all.
