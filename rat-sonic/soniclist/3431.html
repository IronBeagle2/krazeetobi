<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This message, most likely my last, on this mailing list, is not going
<br />
to be an extremely `friendly' one.  Those of you out there with sensitive
<br />
dispositions, or an aversion to out-and-out rage, may wish to discontinue
<br />
reading this self-professed rant at the conclusion of this paragraph.
<br />
This has been something that has been held within me for several months
<br />
now, and the time has come for it to be released.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have sat on this list and read every message that has come through
<br />
for probably the last six or seven months.  During that time, not only have
<br />
I been relatively inactive in my posting, but also have repressed a lot
<br />
of anger and sorrow over the actions of its sysops, especially `Ratman'.
<br />
My reasons for holding back my hate and venom are rather simple to trace,
<br />
really; since I did not want my close relationship with Bookshire to
<br />
be viewed by Ratman as a conspiracy against him, I chose not to endanger
<br />
Bookshire's fanfic archive or his graphics page by complaining about said
<br />
sysop's activities.  But now, this hostile action toward the Sonic fanfic
<br />
community has forced me to react in a firm and unforgiving way, and for
<br />
me to present my case to the people to the best of my ability.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of you new to the list may be wondering what events and
<br />
statements made by said hominid rodent have brought me to make this
<br />
rather brash and probably inflammatory diatribe against him (as well
<br />
as a brief gripe about something Eric, the other sysop, had done).
<br />
Therefore, in the interests of presenting my complaints in an itemized
<br />
and logical form, I shall attempt to list the major offenses below.
<br />
Some other occurrances also led to my current anger, but they have
<br />
either been forgotten or have been of such a small consequence that
<br />
listing every one would be trivial.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first event that turned me toward dislike of the management of
<br />
this list is one that could probably be concieved as a nearly inflammatory
<br />
move on the part of Eric, which was to utilize a posting of mine in order
<br />
to set down a new `list rule'.  What transpired was that in the beginning
<br />
of my fanfic-writing career, I made it a habit to publish my stories
<br />
on the mailing list directly, and then have Bookshire grep them from his
<br />
mailspool and HTMLize it for fanfic-page consumption.  I had not seen a
<br />
single post on said list about anyone disliking my practice of doing this,
<br />
and had, in fact, recieved a few positive comments.  This not only
<br />
encouragedme to continue my writings, but it also gave me a mandate to
<br />
continue this practice further.  Well, after I had sent one of my stories 
<br />
to the list on one fateful afternoon, Eric decided to take the opportunity 
<br />
to put down a new list rule.  Can anyone tell me what it is?  No?  
<br />
Well, it was that no further stories were to be sent to the list.  He used 
<br />
the header of my posting, deleted all of the content of the message (even 
<br />
the `On such-and-such day, X said:' line), and said in no uncertain terms that
<br />
no further fanfic was to be sent to the list.  That's all.  No `good
<br />
story, Joe', no `awful story, Joe', no `nice paragraphing, Joe', but
<br />
instead a subtle incrimination that it was -MY- fault that this new
<br />
policy was being instituted.  Real fucking nice, man.  Yet, I kept
<br />
my mouth closed, and instead did what I was instructed to.  The deep-rooted
<br />
indignation that I possess now was absent in me then, so I meekly shut up
<br />
and obeyed.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, my ire was rose when people CONTINUED, -TOTALLY- unflamed,
<br />
to post fanfic to the list (and multi-part fanfic, I might add) and were,
<br />
in fact, APPLAUDED by the admins!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second incident that rose my bile to a frothing cauldron of rage
<br />
was a posting I had made that I thought was not only Sonic-related, but
<br />
dealt with the problem we had at the time with Sega's legal staff regarding
<br />
the `hentai' pics Bookshire had on the page at the time.  A posting on
<br />
alt.slack caught my eye during that time period that dealt with a similar
<br />
case that Warner Brothers was placing against a similar collection of
<br />
porno pics of toons.  Seeing that this would be a good morale-booster
<br />
for the depressed inhabitants on the list, I chose to grep the article
<br />
from my local NNTP server, edit it a little, and post it onto the list.
<br />
It seemed quite obvious to myself and my close friends that this was
<br />
a completely on-topic post, and it would be, in fact, appreciated by
<br />
all members of the list.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As expected, Ratman (with his utter mastery of the King's English,
<br />
not to mention his totally superior abilities in detecting -CONTEXT-)
<br />
*flamed* me for putting the article on the list, calling it one of the
<br />
most foul, odious, noxious, degrading, and generally Pink things that
<br />
one 'net surfer can call another 'net surfer's transmissions: `spam'.
<br />
Needless to say, it took a far larger expenditure of willpower to not
<br />
utterly blast Ratman off the face of the earth with my verbal gymnastics,
<br />
but I was able to again contain my rage.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third slap in the face that I refused to allow my primal instincts
<br />
to attack was not even directed toward me, but rather toward the
<br />
inhabitantsof the list as a whole.  This was an incident best outlined as a
<br />
general`policy' issue, but it was a very sensitive one for me.  Now, I know
<br />
operators of mailing lists have the right to say whatever they want on
<br />
the list that they operate.  I have no qualms about that right, nor would
<br />
I demand it be removed due to the interests of fair and free speech.
<br />
However, during an otherwise slow time for the list, an interesting,
<br />
but somewhat off-topic thread began; it dealt with the fanfic video game
<br />
(that is still under production, BTW), and the general roles people might
<br />
play in it.  I thought it was amusing enough, and didn't feel it took up
<br />
too much of my mail spool with BS.  After all, it is a simple thing to
<br />
delete 30 messages a day; any jackass with a decent mail-reader can do
<br />
that in one keystroke.  Yet, after a while, Ratman started bitching about
<br />
it because he had obviously lost interest in it.  There was a brief
<br />
verbal scuffle, which can be supported by said members of the discussion,
<br />
and I felt that neither side was totally in the right...in fact, if it
<br />
hadn't been for Ratman's creation of a video-game list, I bet this list
<br />
would have finally collapsed a long time ago.  But it takes two to tango,
<br />
petit, and this therefore can be seen as yet another reason I am 
<br />
unhappy with Ratman's performance.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fourth was perpetrated by Ratman just hours ago, when he had the
<br />
sheer gonads to dare speak afoul of one of the most brilliant,
<br />
skilled, and generally superior human beings I have had the pleasure of
<br />
reviewing the work of, Dan Drazen.  He is probably one of the nicest
<br />
people I have ever read the work of, and does more for Sonic fandom
<br />
in general than most people could ever concieve of.  His writings about
<br />
the Sonic comic are insightful and fair, and his fanfic is probably
<br />
several million times better than anything I could ever dream of writing.
<br />
In fact, I'd dare say that he could write `Nanny nanny boo boo' a million
<br />
times, post it, and I'd -still- like the guy.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, as Ratman was totally expected to do (I was tempted to start
<br />
a pool when I saw Drazen's alledgedly `irritating' post), he went off
<br />
on this great man like he was a common spammer, dissing him far too
<br />
strongly in front of the entire list for acknoledging a quite...interesting
<br />
comment written by an obvious nutcase.  He should have been commended for
<br />
adding even a spittle of thought toward that individual, not crucified and
<br />
chastised by the hominid rodentia for making a minor `fluff' post.  It's
<br />
not like the list was overloaded with spam at the time, anyway.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, the fifth reason is Ratman's actual shutting down of the
<br />
list for reasons that have allegedly stretched back into the past.  He
<br />
says that the system load for him is too much (sure, pal...and I suppose
<br />
the ten billon Mortal Kombat wankers that hit your site every time another
<br />
edition of that blasted game is released doesn't put an infinitesimally
<br />
higher amount of strain on that ISP of yours than some &lt; 50 K mail messages
<br />
that are in-and-out in less than 2 minutes), and that the signal-to-noise
<br />
ratio is too low (one jerk spams us with 5 messages, and two other people
<br />
are learning how to use their mail programs...meanwhile, meaningful
<br />
discussion continues unabated), or that alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog would
<br />
be a better place, anyway (and he -admits- it's more difficult than he
<br />
initially said to get your average po'bucker admin to add a newsgroup to
<br />
your local NNTP spool, especially if it's an alt.* group...also, Quozl
<br />
himself could tell you that the average sysop is probably already wary
<br />
of the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog group because it was allegedly created by
<br />
Tom Servo-ish methods...you think getting alt.tv.k-t-e is hard to
<br />
cajole your sysop into, just wait until he sees your request for a
<br />
group that was allegedly made by Tom Servo!)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, in my opinion, this action was taken strictly as a tantrumish
<br />
lashing-out at those of us who may have offended his sensitive
<br />
sensibilities once too often, or that one was less articulate than he would
<br />
prefer, or even just because he'd stubbed his toe that morning.  Who 
<br />
frigging knows?  All I know is that this action is totally uncalled for, 
<br />
and that any human being with a sense of justice left within them would 
<br />
stand up and -say- something about it.  His current rationale does not 
<br />
wash well with me, and I'm sure that I am not alone.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In closing, I will be sure to tell others about the actions of
<br />
Ratman, sysop of rat.org, throughout my various peer groups of furries,
<br />
cyberpunks, and Wired devotees; and also see to it that a new list is
<br />
createdon a different server to serve those of us still devoted to the Blue
<br />
Guy; with a more lenient sysadmin and fairer policies toward the fanfic
<br />
writer.  Mark my words, fellow Freedom Fighters, I shall not rest until we
<br />
have a new list again.  I refuse to allow such a hard-core group fall apart
<br />
at the seams due to the actions of one misguided individual.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards,
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
