[A request for information on the Chaos Emeralds.]
<br />

<br />
I can't help you as far as the SatAM series (though I don't think the
<br />
Emeralds ever showed up) or the US comic (haven't seen an issue with them
<br />
in it), but I *can* tell you about the games, and my own personal theory 
<br />
about them...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;___    In Sonic 1, there were six Chaos Emeralds that could be collected
<br />
&nbsp;/ _ \   throughout the game; they came in assorted colors (these colors
<br />
/ / \ \  have varied from game to game; if you're interested, I'll make a
<br />
\ \_/ /  list) and were shaped something like the ASCII art to the left.
<br />
&nbsp;\___/   Collecting all six didn't do anything special, except for making
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a better end to the game (Sonic throws them into the air, there's
<br />
a flash, and all the plants and stuff are de-robotisized).  In the Special
<br />
Stage, they were about half as big as Sonic, but in the end sequence
<br />
they're shown to be about hand-sized.  (Perhaps the Special Stage distorts
<br />
spatial relationships?)
<br />

<br />
In Sonic 2, there were seven Chaos Emeralds, of the same shape and
<br />
size(s), and collecting all seven allowed Sonic to turn into Super Sonic,
<br />
a nearly indestructible yellow speed demon.  (Obviously, neither Sonic nor
<br />
'Buttnik found the seventh one the first time around.)  Tails was unable 
<br />
to harness the Emeralds' power.
<br />

<br />
In Sonic 3, the Emeralds were pretty much identical to those in Sonic 2 
<br />
(the color choices may have been different, I don't know), though Super 
<br />
Sonic was powered down a little (made slower, mainly, which is actually 
<br />
an advantage; I've never bothered to get all the Emeralds legitimately in 
<br />
Sonic 2 because Super Sonic there is too hard to control).  Similarly, in 
<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles alone there were no changes (though Knuckles now becomes 
<br />
Super Knuckles, a flashing pink echidna who climbs faster and runs as 
<br />
fast as Sonic usually does).
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;______
<br />
&nbsp;/_/__\_\ In Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles, the first seven Emeralds are still identical
<br />
&nbsp;\ \  / / to those in Sonic 2, but when the S&amp;K portion of the game is
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;\ \/ /  entered, a warp to the Hidden Palace Zone is found.  There, the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\  /   Chaos Emeralds are 'planted', making giant gray Emeralds that are
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\/    nearly as big as Sonic.  Subsequent forays into the Special Stage 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;uncover the seven Super Emeralds, which in that stage are still
<br />
half-Sonic-sized; each one found lights up its counterpart in the 'real
<br />
world'.  When all seven are lit, the Master Emerald, an even bigger 
<br />
(fully Sonic-sized) green gem, lights up, making Sonic Hyper Sonic (a 
<br />
flashing yellow hedgehog who shoots sparks off his body, runs very fast, 
<br />
and can kill most enemies on screen at will, not to mention rocket in any 
<br />
direction in mid-air), Knuckles Hyper Knuckles (flashes pink with 
<br />
afterimages, moves even faster, and can kill enemies by pounding a wall 
<br />
and making the screen shake), and Tails Super Tails (flashes white and 
<br />
his usual orange, flies faster, runs faster, and is attended by four 
<br />
'bluebirds' (who actually match his coloration) that kill enemies on 
<br />
their own initiative).
<br />

<br />
Sonic CD doesn't have Chaos Emeralds, but instead has Time Gems; they 
<br />
look the same, but instead of allowing him to become Super Sonic, they 
<br />
negate Robotnik's presence in the past of the Little Planet, allowing a 
<br />
good ending.  I haven't seen Knuckles Chaotix yet, and don't know 
<br />
anything about the Game Gear versions, except that some of them, I'm 
<br />
told, have the Emeralds hidden on the level instead of in some special stage.
<br />

<br />
I hope this was in some way helpful!  (:3
