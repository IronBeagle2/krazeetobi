Part 6
<br />

<br />
Day Zero
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!  Prepare my personal transport.  Today is the day!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively sighed heavily.  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Today is the day.  I hope we pull this off,&quot; Alison said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me, too,&quot; Sally said.  She pulled out her com-link and checked with
<br />
the other humans and Freedom Fighters.  Everybody was ready.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That afternoon, Robotnik stood on the platform overlooking Nilreb's
<br />
town park.  Not many people bothered to show up, he thought.  Fools.  I
<br />
only wonder why I did not go through with this sooner.  &quot;Thank you for
<br />
coming out here today.  As you know, for the past decade I have strived to
<br />
create a perfect world out of Mobius, a world of technological perfection.
<br />
&nbsp;Even now, however, there is still room for much improvement.  Recently, I
<br />
came to realize how I could make such an improvement.&quot;  He paused,
<br />
surveying the crowd the way he always did, eagerly anticipating the looks
<br />
of surprise and shock they would have when they found out.  &quot;I have
<br />
decided that in order to continue Mobius's movement towards this
<br />
perfection, it would be in the best interests to...&quot;  He paused again. 
<br />
This was the moment.  &quot;...have all the citizens of Nilreb roboticized and
<br />
the city converted to a much needed research center.  Swat-Bots, begin the
<br />
procedure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik looked over the crowd ready to enjoy the fear in their
<br />
faces.  Instead, he heard a word shouted across the park.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NOW!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chaos resulted soon after.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late that evening, Sally, Sonic, Alison, and Sebastian gathered in
<br />
the basement of Alison's restaurant, or what was left of the restaurant. 
<br />
They felt that they could not have asked for a more text-book victory than
<br />
the one they fought for that day.  Within the first half hour, most of the
<br />
Swat-Bots were dismantled, either destroyed in the park, or smashed to
<br />
pieces using whatever the humans and the Freedom Fighters had at their
<br />
disposal around the city.  Robotnik, taken completely by surprise, had
<br />
quickly fled.  He later returned with a new army of Swat-Bots, and they
<br />
tore the city apart looking for people, but by then the remaining humans
<br />
had joined those already safely away from the city.  Alison and the
<br />
Freedom Fighters stayed behind, hiding in their respective areas, to make
<br />
sure that everybody made it to safety.  Now, it was time for the Freedom
<br />
Fighters to go home, and for the humans to go wherever their lives took them.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, Sebastian, are you coming back with us?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian and Alison looked at each other, and once again, there were
<br />
ponderings of what might have been.  Or maybe, what could be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alison...?&quot; Sebastian started to ask.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would love for you to!&quot; she answered.  She walked over and hugged
<br />
him.  &quot;I think I'm stating to like you just a little.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked.  &quot;Aww.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian laughed, embarassed.  &quot;I think I will be going with the
<br />
others, Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled.  &quot;I had a feeling.  Okay, off with you two.  I hope we
<br />
will meet again in the future.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four said their final goodbyes, and then Alison and Sebastian left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stretched and yawned.  &quot;Now let's juice back to Knothole!  I'm
<br />
gettin' tired of this dump!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, let me call the others.&quot;  She pulled out her com-link. 
<br />
&quot;Freedom Fighters, we are ready to return home.  I ask that you be at the
<br />
checkpoint within the next half-hour.  Please confirm.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One by one, the Freedom Fighters replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blinked.  That wasn't everybody.  She spoke into the com-link
<br />
again.  &quot;Tolouse, please confirm.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no answer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no answer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This can't be right, he called right after the initial attack. 
<br />
Sonic, do you remember where he was positioned?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing, Sal!  Be right back!&quot;  He raced up the stairs and out
<br />
into the night.  Ten minutes later, Sally heard him return, walking slowly
<br />
down the stairs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what did you...?&quot;  Sally noticed he was carrying something.  She
<br />
looked, and dropped her com-link.  &quot;Oh gods, no!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw a busted up Swat-Bot, too.  It didn't look pretty.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought, He must have been taken by surprise.  She shook her
<br />
head, trying not to lose control.  Every war had its casualties, she knew.
<br />
&nbsp;But knowing that didn't make it any less painful.  &quot;Let's... let's get
<br />
back to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic nodded and turned to leave, Tolouse's body held carefully in
<br />
his arms.
<br />
