Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />

<br />
A:   &quot;That the Princess Sally miniseries came out at all is a
<br />
minor miracle,&quot; according to Ken Penders, co-writer of the series
<br />
with Mike Kanterovich.  Archie Comics was late in rolling out the
<br />
three-part miniseries starring Sally as the main character--a
<br />
situation acknowledged in the SonicGram of #21.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either did or didn't feature Sally doing battle with
<br />
a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
<br />
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
<br />
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
<br />
SEGA reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series
<br />
(as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would seem to
<br />
indicate that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative
<br />
differences.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;In fairness to the people at SEGA,&quot; Ken writes, &quot;they wanted to
<br />
create a viable environment where the public would be
<br />
anticipating more Princess Sally products such as her own video
<br />
game or line of t-shirts or whatever, and the ...[mini]series
<br />
represented the beginning of that, so it was important to them
<br />
that it was done the best it could be.&quot;  &quot;Scott [Fulop],&quot; he
<br />
adds, &quot;was pulling his hair out during the entire process doing
<br />
his best to keep things moving along.&quot;
<br />

<br />
So why haven't there been subsequent Sally miniseries?  &quot;The
<br />
Princess Sally miniseries just didn't do well enough to warrant
<br />
another shot.  From what we can tell, it seems there was a
<br />
problem with distribution which prevented a lot of people from
<br />
finding and picking up the book.  You also had the core audience
<br />
of little boys that [sic] felt awkward picking up a title that
<br />
they felt was aimed more at girls.  However, when you plopped a
<br />
copy into their hands and made them read the first issue, that's
<br />
all it took.  They were hooked.&quot;
<br />

Q11: What exactly is in those chili dogs?
<br />

<br />
Q11: What exactly is in those chili dogs?
<br />
A:   When a story is set on a planet populated by sentient
<br />
animals, the question of their eating habits is no small matter. 
<br />
How would a planet whose population would include intelligent
<br />
cows and pigs deal with the subject of eating something usually
<br />
thought to be made out of pork and/or beef?  While several
<br />
members of the Sonic mailing list have suggested that the dogs in
<br />
Sonic's chili dogs are fashioned from some meat analog (see
<br />
below), a possible answer appeared at the end of &quot;Let's Get
<br />
Small&quot; (Sonic #33).  In the last panel, Sonic whips up a batch of
<br />
chicken soup which, Rotor explains, is &quot;made with chili dogs.&quot; 
<br />
Since you can't very well call it &quot;chicken soup&quot; if it doesn't
<br />
contain any chicken (at least as far as government regulations
<br />
are concerned), it would appear that those chili dogs Sonic has
<br />
been scarfing for all these years are made using chicken franks! 
<br />

<br />
This theory elicited the following response from Ken Penders:
<br />
&quot;they're made from soybeans or some form of seafood by-products,
<br />
and let's leave it at that.  Sheeesh!  Some things are better off
<br />
left alone!&quot;  Not as far as THIS crowd is concerned.  You knew
<br />
the job was dangerous when you took it, Ken.
<br />
