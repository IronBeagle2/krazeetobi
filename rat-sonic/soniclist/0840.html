<br />
Part 1.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the season, now the question
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to breathe a moment's grace
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the hunter, and the hunted
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take the time to break the pace!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you hopeful, are you haunted
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the Ghost of Christmas Past?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face the future undaunted
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Step aside or take your chance!
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you want to be a Freedom Fighter, huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  I do.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic studied Tolouse, looking him up and down.  Tolouse stood very 
<br />
still, not knowing how and if he should move.  Suddenly, Sonic smiled 
<br />
and slapped him on the back, surprising Tolouse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic laughed.  &quot;I like ya, bud!  I don't know why yet, but I like 
<br />
ya!  So, how'd you know about us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That got Tolouse talking, and he spoke rapidly.  &quot;We had a radio, 
<br />
and we heard talk, and I decided that I should find you, and---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa, slow down there, bud!&quot; Sonic interrupted.  &quot;Why don't you 
<br />
start from a place I can understand.  Like the beginning!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse and Sonic sat down on the forest floor, and Tolouse told as 
<br />
best as he could what had happened.  Sonic listened, seeing the fox move 
<br />
from tears to anger, hearing his voice move from cracking with sorrow to 
<br />
iron-cold with determination.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, the story was over.  Tolouse sat pawing the ground, and Sonic 
<br />
looked at him.  Sonic then smiled to himself.  I just know he'd make a 
<br />
great Freedom Fighter, he thought.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse finally broke the silence with a question he hesitated to 
<br />
ask.  &quot;So.  Will you let me join?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stood up.  &quot;Well...&quot;  Sonic wanted to say yes, but he knew he 
<br />
better check with a certain someone, first.  He studied Tolouse for a 
<br />
second more, and made certain his earlier thoughts.  &quot;C'mon, get up, 
<br />
bud!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse got up, a look of hope on his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here, you better let me carry you.  We'll get there faster.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse look confused.  &quot;Huh?  Faster...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked, holding his hands out.  &quot;You bet!  Come on!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse let Sonic pick him up.  &quot;Where're we going?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knothole!  Hang on!&quot;  Sonic began building momentum.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hang on?  Hang on to wha---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse's last question changed to a scream in utter surprise and a 
<br />
grip for dear life as he experienced his first ride from Sonic the 
<br />
Hedgehog.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally heard a knock, and got up from her seat, setting Nicole down 
<br />
on a table.  She opened the door and saw a familiar hedgehog with a 
<br />
familiar smirk on his face, and an unfamiliar fox who looked like his 
<br />
life had just flashed before his eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sally!  I've got somebody for you to meet.  This is Tolouse.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse caught his breath and nodded politely.  &quot;Hello.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally returned a polite &quot;Hello,&quot; and asked Sonic to step inside.  
<br />
&quot;Who is he?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I found him in the forest, where he'd been following Bookshire.  
<br />
Listen, I think you should talk to him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally remembered Bookshire's earlier visit, and figured this must 
<br />
be the results of Sonic's search.  &quot;Uh-huh,&quot; she said, somewhat curious.  
<br />
&quot;And why is that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He wants to join us.  Hear 'im out.&quot;  Before Sally could reply, 
<br />
Sonic motioned Tolouse inside the hut.  Tolouse stepped in, a little 
<br />
nervously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, this is Sally,&quot; Sonic pretended to clear his throat and 
<br />
then said with a deeper voice, &quot;Princess of the House of Acorn!&quot;  Sonic 
<br />
chuckled, and Tolouse blinked in astonishment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally dismissed the grand title.  &quot;Please, Sonic, you know I'm just 
<br />
'Sally' here.&quot;  Then, she looked at Tolouse, who looked at Sonic as if 
<br />
for a cue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell her what you told me, Tolouse.&quot;  He then walked towards the 
<br />
door.  &quot;I'll be runnin' around outside.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he closed the door, Sally turned and looked at Tolouse again.  
<br />
&quot;So, your name is Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse spoke as confidently as he could.  &quot;Yes.  I want to join 
<br />
the Freedom Fighters.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the first time Sally had heard this.  &quot;I see.  Why do 
<br />
you wish to join?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse told her the story he had told Sonic earlier that morning.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse paced about in Sonic's hut, wondering what they could be 
<br />
saying.  What if they won't let me join? he thought.  They have to!  
<br />
They just have to!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally continued talking in Sally's hut.  Sonic was 
<br />
convinced that Tolouse could help in the cause.  Sally wasn't so sure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I sympathize with him completely.  I've lost my father too,  
<br />
you know.  But we've got quite a few in Knothole asking to go on 
<br />
missions already, and you know we can't just take anybody.  Does he even 
<br />
realize what can happen if a mission fails?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think he does, Sal.  Besides, there aren't many people I know 
<br />
that seem as sure about it than he is.  Most of them I already call 
<br />
Freedom Fighters!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed.  &quot;Well, what can he contribute?  You've got speed, 
<br />
Bunnie has strength, Antoine---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked at the recent addition to the Freedom Fighters.  
<br />
&quot;Yeah, why'd we pick him, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed.  &quot;He's been here as long as we have, and he's studied 
<br />
all the military strategy books and files we could find.  He comes up 
<br />
with a good idea every now and then, you know.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure.  About as often as Rotor cleans his equipment shed!&quot;  Sonic 
<br />
snickered at his own joke.  &quot;Too cool, too cool.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I'm serious.  Every person you and I pick has something to 
<br />
give to the cause, and they know what they face.  Are you sure Tolouse 
<br />
is up to that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a rare moment, Sonic became as serious as Sally was.  &quot;Sally, I 
<br />
think he is.  But you know something else?  I don't think he's really 
<br />
planned for anything else.  Think about it.  He's spent half his life 
<br />
thinking about it, and wandered around in the forest for three weeks 
<br />
trying to find us.  He'd still be out there if he hadn't've seen 
<br />
Bookshire.&quot;  Sonic's and Sally's eyes met.  &quot;I'd hate to be the one to 
<br />
tell him no.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed, still uncertain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sal!  I'll take responsibility for him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally couldn't help but laugh.  &quot;Oh you will, hmm?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic brightened up.  &quot;You betcha!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That would be a first!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  So, will you let him?&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was sitting on Sonic's bed when he heard the door open.  He 
<br />
quickly got up and anxiously asked, &quot;So?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Tolouse, his face revealing nothing.  &quot;Sally wants 
<br />
to see you again.&quot;
<br />

<br />
to be continued
