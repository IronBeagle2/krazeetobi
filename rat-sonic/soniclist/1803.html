Part 5
<br />

<br />
Four days to go...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, are you sure this thing will work?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course it will, Sonic.  I do recommend everyone keep their
<br />
seatbelts fastened, however.  The ride could get quite bumpy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic snapped on the harnesses to the carriage, on of Rotor's latest
<br />
inventions.  &quot;Everybody all nice and snug back there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally's voice hinted at the nervousnous they were all feeling about
<br />
what was certain to be a memorable ride.  &quot;I think so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay!&quot;  Sonic took out a power ring and began to concentrate. 
<br />
&quot;Let's juice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blinding flash, a clap of thunder, and they were off...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a knock at the door, and she answered it.  &quot;Sebastian!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alison we have to tell you something.  This is Sonic and Sally of
<br />
the Knothole Freedom Fighters.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stepped up.  &quot;Nice to meet you Alison, and I wish it could be
<br />
under different circumstances, but there's something you should know...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alison sighed.  &quot;I should have known this would happen.  Okay, I know
<br />
who I need to call.  I'll see if they can come over tonight...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's going to what??&quot;  All around the room, people gasped in horror.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded and displayed the message on Nicole's screen for them to
<br />
see.  &quot;There is no time to second guess this, so please, listen to me.  We
<br />
need to come up with a plan that will not only get this city evacuated,
<br />
but will make sure that there is enough time before Robotnik has a chance
<br />
to find you.  We need to get started on this plan tonight.  Here's what I
<br />
want you to do to begin with...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The populous was alerted, and everybody soon understood the gravity
<br />
of what was happening.  The city of Nilreb slept fitfully that night,
<br />
haunted by dreams of what would happen if Robotnik succeeded in his plan. 
<br />
The next morning, however, they awoke with a new purpose:  to do
<br />
everything they could to keep that from happening.
<br />

<br />
Three days to go...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People were sent to explore the surrounding areas for available
<br />
refuge, when the time for them came.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters, together with Nilreb's computer workers, worked
<br />
to gleen more information from Robotnik's computers about what he intended
<br />
to do.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everybody was gathering supplies, looking for ways to use the least
<br />
amount of space possible.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The city was a little quieter than normal, and if the Swat-Bots were
<br />
better programmed to recognize emotion, they may have been concerned.  But
<br />
they stood their posts, oblivious.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in Robotropolis, Robotnik chuckled, looking over the reports
<br />
saying all was normal with Nilreb.  &quot;Just three more days, Snively.  I
<br />
cannot wait to see the looks on their faces!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A drop of sweat rolled down Snively's cheek.  &quot;Y-yes, sir.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Two days to go...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Sebastian, and Alison used the information drawn from the
<br />
Robotropolis computers to form a plan.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie, Tolouse, and a human named Glyn oversaw the moving of
<br />
supplies to a series of underground caves.  A network of tunnels
<br />
underneath the city served this purpose well.  As Alison had said, &quot;in
<br />
times like this, you take a few precautions.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cat, Antoine, Sonic, and the humans Edward and Melissa saw to it that
<br />
any questions were answered.  Now was not the time for any uncertainty.
<br />

<br />
One day to go...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blur of preparations were coming to an end, and the plan was
<br />
being finalized.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of Nilreb's population would be leaving the city that night,
<br />
while those staying behind would attend a special &quot;announcement&quot; that
<br />
Robotnik was planning to make at the town park.  Robotnik's plan, they had
<br />
found out, was to reveal his plans to roboticize the humans at this time,
<br />
at which point the Swat-Bots would storm the crowd as well as all of the city.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The humans had access to a small collection of explosives, and now,
<br />
they would serve a purpose.  At the right time, explosives planted at
<br />
certain points in the park would detonate, destroying the army of
<br />
Swat-Bots.  Meanwhile, the Freedom Fighters and other humans hidden
<br />
throughout the city would take care of the rest.  If all went well, all
<br />
the humans would be safely out of the city, and by the time Robotnik was
<br />
able to send for more Swat-Bots, the humans would be safely hidden in the
<br />
caves or beyond, ready to lead their new lives.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That afternoon, Sally and Alison talked to the Freedom Fighters and
<br />
the humans that were to help in the final execution of the plan.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...Okay, are there any final questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was silent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  Go home.  Get some sleep if you can.  Good luck to everybody
<br />
tomorrow.&quot;
<br />
