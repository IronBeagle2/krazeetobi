Ahh yes, the glories of writing your own stories about our favorite blue
<br />
wonder..... new friends arrive, old friends go....and, though the wonder and
<br />
simplicity of writing a story comes the trouble....it's not all as simple as
<br />
it seems.  Back in my AOL and Fraudigy days, there were many talented
<br />
writers on both nets that liked to expand the stories and even update Sega's
<br />
views on how Mobius should run.  But, as I fly through the stories, numerous
<br />
conflicts between them arise.  One simple conflict would be (I won't go into
<br />
specifics, and this is NOT an attack for those that cannot determine that,)
<br />
in one story I read Uncle Chuck is alive, well, and &quot;de-robotisized&quot;, and it
<br />
another, (the one I prefer, because as of now, I don't think their is (or
<br />
should be) a way to de-robotisize people,) he is still under Robotnick's
<br />
controll, and a full robot.  This brings two problems: 1) Is any one right?
<br />
That is, which story flies?  And 2) Can there/should there be different
<br />
stories going?  Well, I've decided we need to have stories meet, and
<br />
(through a SINGLE story I'm working on, very long,) I may be able to do it.
<br />
Which brings me to my SECOND question/comment: the process of robotisizing
<br />
itself: in stories, it is my OPPINION, (not an attack, I'm sick of getting
<br />
into debates because people think I'm attacking other people,) that we NEED
<br />
to keep the robotisization in the stories.  I have reasons to back this.
<br />
They are:
<br />
1) Ever watch an old cartoon and the bad guys ALWAYS seem to escape?
<br />
There's a reason for that.  It's so the cartoon continues next week. :)
<br />
Same applies here.  If we figure out how do de-robotisize people, Robotnik's
<br />
lost.  That's the end of the stories.  Think of it: even if Robotnik is
<br />
still in power, all the freedom fighters have to do is un-robotisize the
<br />
others, and it doesn't matter HOW powerful Robotnik is, we'd still win by a
<br />
sheer onslaught of force.  Well, anyone agree/disagree with this?  Let's get
<br />
some posting on this to see what people have to say.  BTW-I don't write
<br />
stories much, and this one I'm working on is VERY long, I just hope it's
<br />
good.  :)  (IF it is, it'll answer LOSTSA questions, and throw things back
<br />
in line, story wise..)
<br />

<br />
Later all....off to the hardships of school!
