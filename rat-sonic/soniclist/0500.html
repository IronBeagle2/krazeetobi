Here we have the latest story from my good freind, Holly-B Kraft on AOL.
<br />

<br />
This story, &quot;Vixen in the Labyrinth&quot;, is an interesting adventure in 
<br />
Robotropolis that does have some very moving parts depending on what 
<br />
frame of mind you're in.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, the story follows my sig. so enjoy!

<br />
I'd like to start out by saying, this story is from before Robotnik was
<br />
defeated. Plus I'd like to thank CamCoon, who really brightened my day
<br />
with his response to &quot;Bunnie's Bad Day&quot;, Bookshire, who happens to be the
<br />
best storyteller around, and I'd also like to say to a certain &quot;Nefaria&quot;
<br />
that I would love it if he sent me more pictures. Clean ones that is. 
<br />

<br />
On wit da storwee...

&quot;VIXEN IN THE LABYRINTH&quot; by Holly-Beth Vixie Kraft (my real name)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a typical Knothole day. Tails was outside playing with
<br />
Sonic. Sally and Bunnie were talking and figuring out things on Nicole.
<br />
Rotor stood in his workshop, and Dulcy was asleep. Antoine happened to be
<br />
on lookout that day, and he was getting very t ired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To no one in particular, he spoke. &quot;Sacre bleu cheese! Zees es
<br />
soooooo boreeng...Ah I know! Oui Oui, yes I will take a break for zome
<br />
loonsh. Zat weel get me goeeng!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine smiled and walked over to the edge of the lookout post to
<br />
reach his sandwich. Unfortunately, there was a loose board, and Antoine,
<br />
being himself, tripped over it, making him squash face first into his
<br />
calamari dish.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails had happened to be looking at Antoine when he
<br />
fell, and they were rolling on the forest floor, laughing. As soon as they
<br />
had calmed down, they ran up the ladder to help him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Ant, why I think squid makes a statement for you!&quot; Sonic sneered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails fell down again and laughed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am not thinkeeng zees was funny! Stop laughing!&quot; Antoine said
<br />
with malice as he picked off his lunch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chill Ant, I just came to tell you that your shift is over, you
<br />
can go back to Knothole.&quot; Sonic smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmph...I knew this! You cannot knit wool over mah eyes!&quot; Antoine
<br />
said matter-of-factly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good, then go! Dulcy takes over from here!&quot; Sonic then whistled
<br />
for Dulcy. It never failed to bring her attention. Hearing it, she got up
<br />
and flew to the lookout.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi Sonic! Hi Tails! Hi...uh..Tony.&quot; paused Dulcy, &quot;Um, Antoine, if
<br />
you don't mind me asking, what happened to you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He was attacked by a killer squid!&quot; giggled Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic laughed. &quot;C'mon Tails, let's go see what your ol' Aunt Sal
<br />
is doing with Bunnie.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay Sonic! Bye Dulcy!&quot; barked Tails, as he climbed down the tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine was close behind him as he and Sonic left.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sal. What's cookin?&quot; said Sonic as he and Tails walked into
<br />
the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi Sonic, we're just working on a plan to sabotage one of power
<br />
plants in Robotropolis.&quot; replied Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Plus we're workin' with Nicole here to find out why I've been
<br />
sleep-walking!&quot; added Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sleep-walking?&quot; said Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mm-hm. I keep going over to the Power Ring Pool in the middle of
<br />
the night, for reasons Sally-girl is trying ta find out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm pretty sure it has to do with a dream you might have had.&quot;
<br />
Sally said to the side of the ongoing conversation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyway, what's the ol' plan?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, there's a cargo shuttle containing fuel and oil that we'll
<br />
sabotage on the way in. When we overtake the Swat-bots on the inside, we
<br />
can lead the shuttle into the Doomsday Area.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way cool plan, Sal. Tails can come, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, I don't think...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good! That's good! You don't think! Okay, so Tails can come with
<br />
me!&quot; Sonic grinned mischievously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally sighed. &quot;So immature...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can I, Aunt Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure Tails, but you are going to be careful, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course, Aunt Sally!&quot; Tails smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes! Past cool, big guy! C'mon, let's get ready.&quot; Sonic said
<br />
motioning to his admirer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively, have you placed that false file about the cargo ship into
<br />
the Swat-bots?&quot; Dr. Robotnik growled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes sir. The freedom fighters have already downloaded it from a
<br />
Stealth-bot this morning.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good, Snively. Very good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now once I have that rodent in my vicinity, we'll invite him and
<br />
his little friends on a trip to my labyrinth.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Labyrinth, sir?&quot; questioned Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yes. It's a complex maze I have made especially for that
<br />
blasted blue burden. Once inside, I will persuade him to find the center
<br />
of the maze. Of course, I'll tell him I will set him and his friends free
<br />
when they reach the center, but in the center of my little labyrinth, is
<br />
really...a Roboticizer!&quot; and with this, the evil Doc laughed. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, Sonic and his friends were packing up to go to
<br />
Robotropolis. It was going to be a tough journey since it had began to
<br />
rain as they headed off. Sonic took Sally and Bunnie on each of his arms
<br />
while Tails flew alongside Dulcy, who was carryi ng an extremely petrified
<br />
Antoine on her back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they all reached Robotropolis, they began the journey to the
<br />
power plant. Smog smothered it. Probably because of over usage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally checked the coordinates from Nicole with the ones she had stolen. According to Nicole, they were right on target.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon you guys, get inside!&quot; Sally whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the Freedom Fighters continued within, when suddenly a giant
<br />
monitor came to life before the steel door slammed shut behind them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the screen was Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Welcome, Welcome!&quot; he sneered, &quot;I see you found my little false
<br />
file in that stealth bot you overtook this morning?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I knew it Robutthead! You're always a snake.&quot; Sonic shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh really? Well, I have another surprise for you. I am pairing you
<br />
up with three other Freedom Fighters, on a trip..through my labyrinth...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the deal Moon-head?&quot; Bunnie cried.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, it's a lovely little maze I designed for all of you. In it,
<br />
there are traps, tricks, and treachery! If you make it to the center of
<br />
the labyrinth, I guess I'll be able to set you free. That IS if you can
<br />
make it to the center.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't be so sure about that, Robo-geek. This is one way past cool
<br />
hedgehog you're talking to. Don't count on us being stopped.&quot; Sonic said
<br />
with certitude.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik chuckled. &quot;We'll see, rodent...we'll see.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, the floor dropped out from beneath all the Freedom
<br />
Fighters, leaving them to a high domed maze. Beside them, were the three
<br />
other Freedom Fighters Robotnik was talking about. All three were girls.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first, a fox about Tails' age, stood up. &quot;I'm Vixie Lamenta,
<br />
Freedom Fighter of Northbreeze. This is Zip,&quot; she said pointing to a
<br />
hedgehog about the same age as Sally, &quot;and this is Annie.&quot; she finished,
<br />
motioning to a young hedgehog, who was younger than all of them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess you're our partners through the labyrinth?&quot; said Zip.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess so,&quot; replied Sally, becoming slightly jealous of Zip.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, let's get this thing over with.&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vixie walked over to Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do you have two?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean tails? I don't know.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that bad?&quot; pondered Vixie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No. I can fly with them.&quot; Tails smiled proudly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, cool!&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was beginning to like Vixie. In fact, her darker red fur was
<br />
very appealing. Like Bunnie, she had a little tuft of hair between her
<br />
ears, which made her look at least twelve.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How'd you get caught..uh..&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, call me Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik tricked us into a mission to destroy a power plant.&quot; he
<br />
paused for a moment, &quot;How did you get caught?&quot; Tails wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik was getting ready to Roboticize my parents, with Zip and
<br />
Annie's. He didn't seem to notice us escape, until we got caught in a heat
<br />
duct.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why didn't he just Roboticize you three?&quot; wondered Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He said that we would need a little extra punishment for
<br />
postponing the inevitable. So he shoved us here.&quot; the vixen answered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's too bad.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group of Freedom Fighters walked on inside the maze. Tails
<br />
held Vixie by her hands and lifted her in the air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rest of the fighters walked on, Annie tugged on Zip's arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Zippy? Are Mama and Daddy gone?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zip looked down at her little sister. &quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When will they come back?&quot; she persisted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Annie, they're not coming back. Robotnik roboticized them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie sighed heavily for a six year old hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sonic had watched the whole thing, and Sonic held Sally
<br />
a little tighter as they walked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they came upon a fork in the maze. One of the forks was lined
<br />
in red, and the other yellow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Which way, Sally-girl?&quot; asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sally, taking out Nicole, &quot;Let me try to see which way
<br />
is safer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole then proceeded to scan the area.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scan shows sign of heavy bot patrol in the red sector, Sally.&quot;
<br />
droned Nicole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yellow.&quot; blurted Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group moved down the yellow path.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy was beginning to get nervous. Her claustrophobia was even
<br />
stronger now, since the yellow path was smaller in height.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine, as usual, was worse off than Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Zip heard something. She began to get ready to juice up, just 
<br />
like Sonic, only her feet began to glow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, she darted off ahead of the troupe. She then commenced
<br />
to blow away Swat-bots with lasers that were attached to the bracelets on
<br />
her arms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was at that time, that Tails noticed Vixie had a bracelet too.
<br />
And he began to fly over the bots, letting Vixie fire from above.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy took on a trio of Stealth-bots by freezing them with her icy
<br />
breath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine tried his best to use his &quot;king-fu&quot; to stop a particular
<br />
Swat-bot that had the little squire on it's mind. Ant was losing, so Rotor
<br />
and Bunnie came in and finished it off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie jumped into Sally's arms, full of fear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally ran off to the side of the tunnel, where she began to calm
<br />
the little girl down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor had been pulling out the main wire consoles of the bots he
<br />
had ambushed, putting the parts in his utility belt. Probably will be
<br />
helpful later, he thought.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie just began punching the bots out of her way, or kicking
<br />
them with her powerful robotic legs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, the Swat-bot team was finished.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proud of their victory, they cheered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik, who had been watching all along, began to chuckle
<br />
subtly. He then brought out his microphone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters stopped and stared at a descending monitor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very good, my little Freedom Fighters. Did you think that was
<br />
easy?&quot; Robotnik scoffed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Piece of cake, Robuttnik!&quot; shouted Vixie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, is that so, little vixen? We'll see about that.&quot; the evil
<br />
doctor smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, the monitor withdrew.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instantly, the Freedom Fighters began tumble to the ground from a
<br />
large tremor that had just begun. After looking behind them, they noticed
<br />
that the yellow cavern was caving in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic! We've got to get out of here!&quot; Sally yelled over the rumbling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Grab on you guys!&quot; said Sonic to Bunnie, Sally, and Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After they did what they were told, Sonic shot down the tunnel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy was making sure Tails, Vixie, Rotor, and the other two
<br />
hedgehogs were secured on her back. When everyone was set, she cracked the
<br />
whip, which sent the six Freedom Fighters screaming through the yellow
<br />
corridor. It wasn't long before she had caught up with Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic! I see a light up ahead!&quot; shouted Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as Sonic heard that, he knew what to do.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Slap me some power, Sal!&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally proceeded to grab a power ring from Sonic's backpack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked over to Dulcy, &quot;Prepare to crack the whip again, Dulcy!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got ya Sal!&quot; came her reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally handed the ring to Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an initial power surge, Sonic shot off, dragon right behind
<br />
him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they made it to the light, the tunnel had already begun to
<br />
gain on them, and was nearly ready to fall on top of them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last, they emerged from the tunnel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We made it you guys! We did it!&quot; shouted Vixie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ha! No problem.&quot; crowed Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's great monitor then showed up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No problem, Sonic Hedgehog? My, what an aspiration we have. Well
<br />
I've only one more trick up my sleeve, and that, my dear boy, is my worst
<br />
yet. Are you all set?&quot; Robotnik grumbled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You bet your gut on it.&quot; Sonic grinned readily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah...I'm glad. Farewell, Sonic Hedgehog. You were such a dirty
<br />
little rodent.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the monitor disappeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor walked up to Sonic. &quot;What do you think he has planned for us
<br />
next?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know Rote, but I don't think I'm gonna like it.&quot; Sonic
<br />
confessed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lookie!&quot; shouted Annie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the party were two more hedgehogs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mama?! Papa?!&quot; exclaimed Zip.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What happened?&quot; Annie cried.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS, BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK!&quot; the parents droned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh Tails! I can't believe it...&quot; Vixie said as she began to cry
<br />
softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot; said Tails as two more Roboticized individuals stepped out
<br />
into the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's...he's torturing us!&quot; Vixie sobbed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roboticized individuals were Vixie's parents.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No...&quot; she whispered softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vixie the fell into Tails' arms, crying.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mama, Papa, please, we're only trying to help you!&quot; shouted Zip.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Annie was crying.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DETAIN FREEDOM FIGHTERS, BY ORDER OF ROBOTNIK!&quot; they droned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally turned to Sonic. &quot;We've got to get them out of here. They'll
<br />
be lured into his trap!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, hang on.&quot; Sonic replied, putting out his arms for Sally to
<br />
jump into.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then began to race around the room, diverting the attention of
<br />
the parents.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEDGEHOG! PRIORITY ONE! PRIORITY ONE!&quot; they shouted monotonously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie had already caught on to Sonic's plan, and she rushed to
<br />
gather up Annie, Vixie, and Zip. After telling them a few things, she ran
<br />
over to Rotor, girls following behind her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, I think there's a door over there! Try an see if y'all can
<br />
open it. We've gotta get these kids out of here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Onto it Bunnie!&quot; said Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor then ran to the door. He noticed a number keypad to open the
<br />
door, so he searched his utility belt. Finding the wire consoles, he then
<br />
began to reprogram the door. In less than one minute, the door was open.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good old sugar!&quot; Bunnie smiled as she gathered her companions and
<br />
ran into the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the only people left were Sonic and Sally, Bunnie then
<br />
whistled for Sonic to head into the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he and Sally arrived inside the room, the door shut
<br />
behind them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All was dark.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Welcome to the center of my Labyrinth.&quot; said a voice, &quot;Now I guess
<br />
I'll have to set you free.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lights jolted on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO!!&quot; Sonic shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing in front of him were Roboticizers built for each one of
<br />
the party. Below them, were the names of the Freedom Fighters, engraved in
<br />
gold.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Game......OVER!&quot; shouted Robotnik, standing next to the one marked
<br />
&quot;Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swat-bots then cornered the group and began to take each
<br />
individual to their roboticizer. The bots had just finished putting in
<br />
Vixie when suddenly Dulcy began to belch loudly. When she burped, Dulcy
<br />
emitted smoke and she planned on getting everyone out of there.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik began to yell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ACTIVATE! ACTIVATE IT YOU TWITS!&quot; he shouted at his bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as the group escaped, Tails watched the Roboticizer beam up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;VIXIE!&quot; he cried.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Vixie began to be enveloped in a yellow beam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No! No! NO!&quot; Tails shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic grabbed Tails' arm. &quot;C'mon! We've got to find a way out of
<br />
here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not leaving without...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was done.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...Vixie.&quot; he whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic took Tails by the hand and shot off through a wall. The rest
<br />
followed him. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's gone! I can't believe she's gone!&quot; sobbed Tails when they
<br />
arrived at Knothole, &quot;I'll never see her again!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sorry, Tails, but we couldn't have saved her anyway. It was
<br />
too late!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's my fault Tails.&quot; said a voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy?&quot; Tails looked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was a stupid plan. I should have gone over it with the rest of
<br />
you. It's all my fault.&quot; she replied softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's okay Dulcy. We had to act for ourselves. I don't blame you
<br />
for a thing.&quot; Tails cried softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong guys?&quot; said a voice from behind them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;VIXIE?!&quot; they all shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's me!&quot; said the little vixen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you escape? I saw you roboticized!&quot; said Tails frantically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back in Northbreeze, I was voted the town's best scientist. I had
<br />
a spare model of myself in my backpack which I let the Swat-bots think was
<br />
me. Robotnik Roboticized a robot!&quot; she explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails ran up to Vixie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm just glad you're okay.&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, he laid a kiss on her cheek.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vixie blushed, then hugged Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought I'd never see you again!&quot; said Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm right here! Smile! You'll be able to see me as often as you
<br />
want.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course!&quot; Vixie paused, &quot;Tails, you're the best friend I've ever
<br />
had. I'm glad I made it out alive. I could have never been able to live
<br />
without a friendship like ours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We haven't known each other for very long, Vixie.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, still, you've proven to be an asset in my life. In
<br />
Northbreeze, I had no friends. No one. You've introduced me to friendship,
<br />
and I think I like it very much.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I'll always be here for you.&quot; said Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie took this time to interrupt the two foxes. &quot;Supper time,
<br />
sweethearts! Y'all don't want to starve, do you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a smile Tails ran towards the dining hall. Leaving Vixie behind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon!&quot; he shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be right there Tails!&quot; said Vixie as she watched everyone
<br />
leave. Turning around to face Robotropolis, she whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I love you Mama, I love you daddy.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE END
<br />

<br />
