<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;And what about the magic of Mobius, such as the Time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Stones...[NOP!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   I've always had this bad feeling about time travel.  It's either possible
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;or impossible.  If it was possible, wouldn't people be coming back into time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and visiting us?  Eventually, time machines will be sold in 7-11s like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;batteries and anybody could use one.  By that time, all the psycos would've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;gone back in time and screwed the human race to extinction.  There is only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one scenario that I can think of were time travel is possible: the government
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;became so powerful that it can monitor every move we make.  This way, nobody
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;can use their time machines other than their most trusted politicians.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   -B.B.
</em><br />

<br />
&quot;Most trusted politicians&quot; - HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!
<br />
That is the BEST oxymoron I've heard in a LONG time....
<br />

<br />
About time travel:
<br />
As far as Modern Physics may dictate our understanding of time travel, it
<br />
would be impossible (remember Sally: &quot;time travel violates all the laws of 
<br />
physics&quot;)
<br />
However, it is possible to slow time down using Einstein's theory of 
<br />
relativity...
<br />
Consider a mother of age 25, with a daughter age 2.  If the mother goes into 
<br />
space (in a rocket) &amp; travels at 99% of the speed of light for 30 years, 
<br />
when she returns
<br />
to Earth, she will have aged 4 years, while her daughter will have aged 30!
<br />
The mother is 3 yrs.  younger than her daughter!
<br />
(I didn't bother to put the equations in...they are tedious &amp; boring - if 
<br />
you don't believe me, send me an E-mail and I'll send 'em to ya :) )
<br />

<br />
That is the closest thing there is to &quot;time travel&quot; in our universe (as we 
<br />
understand it today) , but since there is still  so much unexplained 
<br />
evidence of what we don't know, one may not rule out the possibility...
<br />

<br />
This is the reason why &quot;magic&quot;  portrayed in Sonic could in fact be 
<br />
real...it isn't really &quot;magic&quot;, it is just not understood by the amazed 
<br />
spectators...
<br />

<br />
Another example:  immagine a scientist traveling back in time to the dark 
<br />
ages...
<br />
let's say he/she demonstrated the use of a magnet to the people of that 
<br />
time.  What would the likely result be?   Simple - a mob of people screaming 
<br />
&quot;WITCH&quot; &amp; crying out to kill the &quot;magican&quot; who was obviously a servent of 
<br />
Lucifer.  We today can't fully relate to how those people might have felt to 
<br />
see such a &quot;strange&quot; occurrence. -
<br />
but we CAN relate to what the future will eventually bring- more &quot;magic&quot;
<br />

<br />
You might also remember that one of the 1st season shows  had a magician who 
<br />
took Sonic's speed away   - By using the electronic belt he was wearing! 
<br />

<br />
Remember:magic is only an illusion - and usually only the magician knows the 
<br />
&nbsp;secret........
<br />

<br />
(I'm just trying to show that Mobius could in fact be a future Earth - I 
<br />
feel like the only one, though)
<br />

<br />
***I belive T.V. is very educational...whenever someone turns
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the T.V., I go into the next room and read a good book.***
