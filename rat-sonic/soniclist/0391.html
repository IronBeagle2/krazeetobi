<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; No more so than Sonic does if you're playing S&amp;K without S3 'locked on'.
</em><br />

<br />
Don't forget that _Sonic_ is the tough and way past cool hero. _He_ can  
<br />
face Robotnik on his own. Tails however is mostly a cute-looking and  
<br />
adorable fox. In 'Sonic II' he is only 6 1/2 years old (according to the  
<br />
manual) and only 10 years in the cartoon. To my opinion this is a little  
<br />
too young to fight Robotnik all alone during the _whole_ game.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Besides which, we never said Sonic couldn't do cameos.  Maybe Robotnik
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sets up a 'speed trap' across a section of canyon; Sonic gets bagged, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails lags behind and escapes the trap.  Now the Happy Fun Fox has to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rescue Sonic before Robotnik can roboticize the speedy hedgehog...
</em><br />

<br />
Heroes don't just run into traps and then wait to be rescued (there are  
<br />
numerous examples for this). If they _really_ get cought they find a way  
<br />
to get out themselves. However, it is possible that Sonic (or another  
<br />
suitable character) would aid young Tails in his first solo adventure.  
<br />
Then in the last level they could get separated and Tails has to take the  
<br />
final challenge alone (Tails _is_ a tough fighter when he is forced to  
<br />
be). A similar situation occurred in the Tails solo story 'Zonerunner' in  
<br />
one of the Fleetway comics.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; To my opinion it would be much more fun if you just could select Tails
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; as the leading character and Sonic as his sidekick.
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I think they should have had this in S2/3, myself.  Sonic 4 should
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; *definitely* allow free mixing and matching of all playable characters
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (to the extent the plot allows), and maybe even midgame swaps (Sonic has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to decide at one point whether he'd rather keep Tails with him or set out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the nosy echidna...)
</em><br />

<br />
That's a _very_ good idea. But don't forget that Sonic has to look cool in  
<br />
every situation (that's his charisma). It wouldn't look cool if he acted  
<br />
like Tails when controlled by the CPU (stomping merrily into traps,  
<br />
enemies, shots etc.). If this feature will be added, the programmers  
<br />
_definitely_ have to work out some sophisticated routines to let the CPU  
<br />
played character avoid these things.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; But if Tails really gets his own game he should have a companion so he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; doesn't have to face Robotnik all on his own.
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; How about a bluebird, like the ones that fly around him when he's Super?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It wouldn't bash bad guys like Tails does for Sonic, but it could point
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out secret routes and hidden powerups, and could also do cute stuff when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails idles or reaches the end of an Act (like perching on Tails' ear, or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the end-of-Act post) or when a boss shows up (pecking futilely on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robotnik's chromedome).  Of course, once Tails goes Super, it's a whole
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'nother story.  (:3  (Evil nasty wicked bad bluebird, to borrow a sig...)
</em><br />

<br />
A _real_ companion would be better so they could make it a 2 player game.
<br />
But I don't see a reason why Tails couldn't have a bluebird for backup  
<br />
support as well.

Again, just my opinion
