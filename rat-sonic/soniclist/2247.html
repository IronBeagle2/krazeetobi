<br />
Visions in the Wind: Walkabout
<br />

<br />
by Ed Becerra.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some days later...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So this is what things looks like when you've got rain on a regular
<br />
basis.  Kinda beautiful.&quot; said Edward Anthony Coyote.  &quot;Bit damp for the
<br />
likes of me, though.  Funny to see _green_ grass everywhere, instead of
<br />
brown buffalo grass, cactus, and tumble weeds.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha had left his native dry, wind-swept desert prairie far behind
<br />
him, and had just reached the edge of the Great Plains that lay next to the
<br />
Great Forest.  He still had a ways to go before he reached the forest and
<br />
could start looking for the village of Knothole and it's famous Freedom
<br />
Fighters.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He lifted his muzzle and sniffed at the wind.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I smell water.  Good thing, too.  Been a long way since that last water
<br />
hole.  Cain't hardly eat jerky without water.  Gotta refill my water skin.
<br />
Hmmm...  Smells like it's in that direction.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned in the direction the scent was coming from, and limped slowly
<br />
off towards it.  He was moving a little stiffly.  His back and legs were
<br />
bothering him again.  It was the damp climate.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around.  &quot;Better start looking out for those furshlugginer
<br />
SWATbots.  I'm a lot closer to Robotopolis, now.  Probably got regular
<br />
patrols out this way, hunting for any poor fool dumb enough to leave the
<br />
protection of the forest.  And right now, that means _me_.  I wonder why I
<br />
haven't seen any already.  Robotnik's usually quite the paranoid.  Used to
<br />
be he'd have 'bots patroling out along the edge of the prairie.  But that
<br />
stopped some time ago.  Something's happened.  But what?  He's evil and a
<br />
more than a little stupid, but not careless.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha pondered these thoughts as he walked, his cane thumping
<br />
rythmically on the ground beside him.  The scent of water was growing
<br />
closer.  The conclusions he was coming to worried him.  He didn't like that.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dammit!  The tribes just don't have enough information on how the
<br />
rebellion is going.  I _told_ the shaman that, more than once.  We need
<br />
connections to groups who are closer to the fighting.  Well, once I get
<br />
ahold of this 'Davey Crockett' Old Man Coyote wants to talk to, maybe I can
<br />
convince Princess Sally to share what her freedom fighters know with the
<br />
Wild Pack.&quot; he growled to himself.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sighed.  One more job to do.  Didn't the work _ever_ end?  Wasn't it
<br />
enough that he was mashed up in that stupid accident?  Hadn't he done
<br />
enough, already?  He snarled angrily.  All he ever really wanted out of life
<br />
were a few good books and a little time to read them.  But duty called, in a
<br />
tone he couldn't resist.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could hear the babbling of the small creek now.  And, in the distance,
<br />
an odd, whining noise that was rapidly coming closer.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Crud!  That's a hovercycle!  SWATbots for sure!*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He yanked a camoflauge tarp from his pack, wrapping it around himself.
<br />
He dropped to the ground, looking for all the world like a clump of grass
<br />
and dirt.  He gripped his cane tightly.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Okay, maybe they haven't noticed me yet.  If so, then I've got the
<br />
advantage of surprise.  Best use it for all it's worth.  One coyote against
<br />
several Swats ain't good odds.* he thought.  *Gonna need every advantage I
<br />
can get.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking underneath the edge of the tarp, Kickaha could see the cycle
<br />
coming in for a landing near the edge of the small creek.  The whining sound
<br />
stopped, as the Swat piloting it shut down the engine.  There were two of
<br />
them, the pilot and one Swat riding shotgun behind it.  REALLY riding
<br />
shotgun!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Damn!  That's gotta be the biggest shotgun I've ever seen!  From here,
<br />
looks like a USAS-12 12-guage fully automatic assault shotgun.  With a
<br />
ten-round clip, at that.  And it's carrying plenty of extra clips.  Old Man
<br />
Coyote is REALLY gonna owe me for this one.  I'm not a fighter anymore, just
<br />
a crippled-up ex-soldier and shaman-in-training.  Oooh...  just wait 'til he
<br />
gets my bill!  I'm gonna demand an entire library for this one!  May the
<br />
fleas of a thousand prairie dogs infest his fur!  May he...  Whoops, here
<br />
comes one!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SWATbot with the big shotgun dismounted from the hovercycle, and
<br />
started circling around it, searching the area in an ever widening pattern.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*They must have spotted me, or they wouldn't have landed and started a
<br />
search.  But they're not certain where I am.  That gives me a chance.  Not
<br />
much, but it's better than nothing.  Better let the Swat come to me.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He could hear the clanking of the SWATbot's joints as it approached his
<br />
hiding place.  *Heh.  It's joints sound even noisier than mine.  Guess it
<br />
could use a little oil.  Well, so could mine.  It's almost here.  Get
<br />
ready...  Get set...  * he thought.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then something happened.  A huge black raven swooped out of the sky,
<br />
pecking at the Swat's eyes.  The SWATbot raised it's shotgun and turned to
<br />
fire at the attacking bird.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*HEY!  It's back is to me!* This thought flashed through his mind as he
<br />
leaped from under the tarp, gripping his cane with both paws.  One claw
<br />
touched a stud hidden among the carvings that decorated it.  A twelve inch
<br />
long steel spike with razor sharp edges shot out from the base of the staff.
<br />
He jumped up behind the Swat, swinging his cane overhead, like the short
<br />
spear that it had become.  A heartbeat later, the Swat had a full foot of
<br />
blade buried through the back of it's head.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha looked down at the dead 'bot.  *I really must remember to thank
<br />
the Timber Wolf tribe for this cane.  And compliment them on the quality of
<br />
the steel they make.  They _said_ it would cut right through a SWATbot.  And
<br />
they were right.* Pulling his cane out of the swat's head, he pressed the
<br />
stud again, retracting the blade.  He took note of the weapon the 'bot had
<br />
dropped when he had spiked it.  *Humph.  Be a cryin' shame to let a
<br />
perfectly good shotgun like this go to waste.* He picked it up, and
<br />
unbuckled the belt full of extra ammo clips the 'bot had around it's chest.
<br />
He slung the ammo belt over one shoulder, and checked the weapon.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Hey, HEY, hey!  There's a round chambered, the clip's full, and the
<br />
safety's...  off.  Whoa!  Lucky for me it didn't go off when it hit the
<br />
ground.  Thank the Great Spirit for grip safeties.  And the selector
<br />
switch's set to full auto.  Stupid 'bot.* He reset it to single shot.
<br />
*Guess they just don't program SWATbots like they used to.  Now to go 'bot
<br />
hunting!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He dropped his pack to the ground.  The raven who'd saved his life hopped
<br />
over to it, and pecked at it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Quiet, bird!&quot; he whispered.  &quot;Do ya want that other 'bot ta blow yer
<br />
head off?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slipped into the tall grass on the bank of the creek, circling in the
<br />
opposite direction from the defunct SWATbot.  Moving slowly, cautiously, he
<br />
spotted the remaining swat waiting with robotic patience on the cycle.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Can you say `Dead Meat', Mr. Swatbot?  Good.  I knew you could!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stepped out of the concealing grass with the shotgun raised.  The 'bot
<br />
on the cycle whirled around when it sensed his approach.  But not fast
<br />
enough.  Kickaha pulled the trigger three times.  The slugs hammered the
<br />
swat's chest in, knocking it backwards over the seat of the hovercycle.
<br />
When it tried feebly to rise, he let it have four more rounds.  These shots
<br />
ripped completely through the 'bot's body shattering it's chest, and tearing
<br />
the 'bot apart.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, HEY, hey!  Looks like I can _ride_ the rest of the way to the Great
<br />
Forest.  Finally, a little good luck, for a change!&quot; he gloated.  He walked
<br />
forward to dump the second swat's body from the seat.  Suddenly, he heard a
<br />
hissing, crackling noise coming from it's corpse.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, crud!  Not again!&quot; he growled, dropping to the ground, and rolling
<br />
quickly into the nearby creek.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;! ! ! B O O O O M ! ! !
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SWATbot, and it's hovercycle, exploded in a fireball of destruction.
<br />
When the flames died down, there was nothing left but a few small pieces of
<br />
metal, a lot of ashes, and a small crater near the banks of the creek.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward crawled out of the small creek, covered in water weeds and mud,
<br />
his fur soaking wet.  He still gripped his cane and the SWATbot's shotgun,
<br />
though.  _Kickaha's_ shotgun, now.  He bent painfully, and fished the ammo
<br />
belt from the bottom of the stream.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned toward the smoking crater, and gave it a dirty look.  &quot;Damn!
<br />
Must have hit the power supply.  Or a booby trap.  Guess it's still the old
<br />
Leather Personel Carrier for me.  Well, no use crying over spilled oil.  At
<br />
least I came out of this with more than I came in with.  This shotgun's
<br />
gonna be pretty useful if I run into more SWATbots.  Speakin' o' which,
<br />
gotta grab my gear and get going.  If that blast didn't get the attention of
<br />
every SWATbot within ten miles, then I'm Snivley's brother-in-law!&quot; He shook
<br />
the water and mud from his fur as best he could, and headed towards his
<br />
backpack.  &quot;I _hate_ walking, I do, I really, really do.&quot; he muttered.
<br />
&quot;Well, that's not true.  I _like_ walking.  It's the back pain that I really
<br />
_HATE_!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he got to the spot where he'd left his pack, he saw the large black
<br />
raven was still there, perched on top of it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, guy!  Thanks for the help, but I gotta run now.  And so should you.
<br />
Pretty soon, this place is gonna be hip-deep in SWATbots.&quot; He reached for
<br />
the pack, folding up the camo tarp and stuffing it inside.  He turned to say
<br />
goodbye to the raven, but when he saw what was happening to the bird, he
<br />
couldn't get out a single word.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird's body was blurring, stretching, and changing.  A golden light
<br />
surrounded it.  It grew larger.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Kickaha stood a four-legged coyote, as large as a small pony.
<br />
Then it changed again.  From four legs, it went to two.  It's fur peeled
<br />
back.  It was as if a human was crawling out of a cocoon of coyote skin.
<br />
When it was done, a man stood there, wearing what seemed to be a coyote-skin
<br />
headdress, complete with the coyote's head.  He smirked at Ed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Cheyenne call me Wihio, the Sioux, Iktome.  The Blackfeet call me
<br />
Napi Old Man.  The Cree call me Saultaux, the Micmac, Glooscap.  I am the
<br />
Great Hare on the East Coast and Raven on the West.  But you can just call
<br />
me...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...Old Man Coyote!  What are you doing here?!  I'm already _doing_ what
<br />
you asked!&quot; Edward growled angrily.  &quot;You didn't need to check up on me!  I
<br />
keep my word and pay my debts, Old Man.  You _know_ that.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not checking up, I'm apologizing.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... huh ...?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those swatbots were my fault.  I knew you were still having trouble
<br />
walking.  So, I decoyed one here so you could count coup, and take his
<br />
hovercycle.  But two showed up, instead.  Two swatbots again one coyote with
<br />
a bad back is unfair odds, so I lent a hand.  But I didn't plan on the cycle
<br />
exploding.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh.  Heh!  Well, neither did it!  I'm not hurt, I counted two 'bots, and
<br />
I've taken trophy from one.&quot; He held up the shotgun and ammo belt.  &quot;I've
<br />
lived with the pain before, and it hasn't stopped me yet.  So, I might as
<br />
well get a move on.  There's a Great Plain to cross before I can reach
<br />
Knothole and find Davey Crockett.&quot; Kickaha shrugged, picked up his pack,
<br />
slung the shotgun and turned to go.  &quot;But it's nice to know you still
<br />
care...  Grandfather.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He trudged off towards the Great Forest, cane in paw.  Coyote watched him
<br />
go.  Kickaha was almost out of sight, when Old Man Coyote left.  He blurred
<br />
into the form of a large black crow.  And as it flew away, the wind
<br />
whispered...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take care of yourself... Grandson.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Be Continued...
