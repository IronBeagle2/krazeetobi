one.  Perhaps I have a good reason to get a CD ROM now.  Any idea what

<br />
Hiyas.  I found Sonic 26 at our local comic shop yesterday.
<br />

<br />
I don't have time to type up a review although I wanted to make a few 
<br />
comments:
<br />

<br />
Manak is back.. He did the first story and it looks like he forgot to draw
<br />
Sally's blue vest... Wups.  Oh well, It was supposed to be a hot summer day
<br />
in the story anyway (at least until Robotnik started causing trouble).
<br />

<br />
Art Mawhinney penciled the 2nd story with Bunny Rabbot being one of the
<br />
main acting characters (instead of her just standing around in the 
<br />
background as usual).
<br />

<br />
Again in SonicGrams they talked about the upcoming miniseries starring 
<br />
our own favorite 'happy fun fox', Tails.  It should be out in the fall.
<br />
You can even write to 'Tails-Grams' to get your letters in early.
<br />

<br />
By the way.. to that new guy on the list who said he had Sonic stories:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hooray!  We haven't had Sonic stories on this list for a while!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't wait to see em.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;That sounds a bit hard to do on a home PC

<br />
Actually, there are some shareware sound editing programs that might allow 
<br />
someone to accomplish that, but it wouldn't be easy.  And it's a pretty

stupid idea anyway.

I'm CCing this to my mini-Sonic list plus the &quot;real&quot; one FWIW; hope that's

OK...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I haven't heard anything about the latest Sonic The Hedgehog issue from

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the peanut gallery. (or anywhere else it seems)

<br />
I just sent you 4 comments on 25 from the list, plus one on 26.  I haven't 
<br />
made any myself because I haven't picked my copies up yet :^(  However, I 
<br />
did scan through 25 the other day in a bookstore, and...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I thought that there 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would be a cute-off between Dot Warner and Amy Rose Hedgehog fer sure.
</em><br />

<br />
Well, neither compare to Babs/Fifi/Bunny/Sally...  I'll be picking up my 
<br />
copies probably this weekend and may have more to say after that.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I used to be a normal person, (YOU! hush) before I got caught up in the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;STH discussions.  Now I haunt the newsstand waiting for the next issue to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appear.  I'm quickly becoming the oldest fanboy on the net. It's not fair!
</em><br />

<br />
Well I know Bob Repas (aa2043_at_mumble) is also a 40-something, so maybe you 
<br />
and he can commiserate or some junk :^)  But don't worry, in ten years I'll 
<br />
probably be in the same situation, unless I get a life between now and 
<br />
then...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I can now understand the Fifi fixation of Quozl, the anvil fetish of the

entitled DA STORY.  Right now, we're in BOOK 1: THE SONIC SAGA.  It's too

big for me to send all at once, so I'll send it one act at a time.  The

Act 1:The Attack and Recovery
<br />
Part 1:The Attack
<br />
Sonic T Hedgehog,official protecter of Mobious,destroyed
<br />
Robotnick's Death Egg 1 year ago.Now 18,Sonic and Tails live
<br />
a carefree life with Sonic's Uncle Chuck,a great inventor.
<br />
&quot;Italian plumbers.I hate 'em.And that dog of a dog is the
<br />
worst!&quot;Sonic grumbled.
<br />
&quot;Sonic,I have to use the bathroom,&quot;complained Tails.
<br />
&quot;OK,keed.But use the one by Uncle Chuck's bedroom,&quot;replied
<br />
Sonic.
<br />
&quot;But there are spiders in there...&quot;
<br />
&quot;They're not poisonous!&quot;
<br />
Tails shuffled into the bathroom.
<br />
&quot;Sonic come here...&quot;
<br />
&quot;If you were going to say quick it wouldn't change much!&quot;
<br />
Uncle Chuck was holding two pointy shoes and a glowing ring.
<br />
&quot;These are for you.You can travel at Supersonic speeds using
<br />
them,&quot;said Chuck.
<br />
&quot;But what about Speed?He needs them more than me!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Speed wouldn't use them.Your brother's as lazy as a
<br />
hedgehog.&quot;
<br />
&quot;My brother IS a hedgehog!&quot;corrected Sonic.
<br />
Suddenly,there was an earthquake and a ripping sound.Sonic,
<br />
holding Chuck,raced to speeds room.
<br />
&quot;I've got Sonic,Speed,&quot;suddenly a claw grabbed Chuck,&quot;And
<br />
your Uncle,too.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Robotnik,that's Speed.I'm Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Don't think you can fool me,hedgehog.I love watching the
<br />
weakest perish!HAHAHA!&quot;Robotnik flew away.Tails entered the
<br />
room.
<br />
&quot;Was there an earthquake?&quot;Tails asked.
<br />
&quot;Worse.We have our work cut out for us,&quot;Sonic replied.

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 2:Sonic Chaos
<br />
Sonic and Tails thought they destroyed the Death Egg and Dr.
<br />
Ivo Robotnik.But they were wrong...REALLY wrong!Robotnik
<br />
grabbed Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck,signaling the
<br />
start of a 25 act adventure...
<br />
ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!
<br />
Sonic zoomed passed Green Hill...or what was left of it.It
<br />
was now polluted and uninhabatanted.Suddenly,Sonic tripped..
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OOF!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Pweencess Sally,we caught one!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Workerbot?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Wewe.&quot;
<br />
Sonic opened his eyes.In front of him was a fox with a sword
<br />
&quot;I'm no workerbot!Anyway...what's a workerbot?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Oops.I was wrong.You are a hedgehog,no?&quot;the fox asked.
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;Sonic got up...and fell again.This time on purpose.In
<br />
front of him was Princess Sally.
<br />
&quot;Get up.I'm not a princess of much now.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Robotnik attacked Mobious.There are only a few survivors.
<br />
Who are you?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sonic T. Hedgehog at your service.&quot;
<br />
&quot;YOU were spared?What luck!Maybe we can restore Mobious!&quot;
<br />
&quot;We WILL restore Mobious.Uh,how.&quot;
<br />
&quot;First we must find the Chaos Emeralds..&quot;
<br />
&quot;You mean these?&quot;
<br />
Sonic pulled out 7 emeralds.
<br />
&quot;No Sonic.The emeralds of life.Those are the emeralds of
<br />
power.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Pardon me,my pweencess...&quot;the fox interupted.
<br />
&quot;Oops,how rude.This is Antoine,the royal guard.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Yes,but what is the 2nd thing?&quot;Antoine asked.
<br />
&quot;Find all the survivors of the attack.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot;Sonic said.
<br />
Tails finally came out of the tree he was hiding in and
<br />
followed Sonic and co.

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 3:&quot;Climb Up a Tree and Act Like a Nut&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails THOUGHT they killed Robotnik...until he
<br />
took Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck.After falling
<br />
into a trap,Sonic learned that Robotnik cleared out Mobious
<br />
and Sonic must get the 6 Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails finally caught up with Sonic.&quot;Where are we going?&quot;
<br />
he asked.
<br />
Sonic stopped,&quot;I dunno',li'l bro'.But I once had them...&quot;
<br />
&quot;And you locked them in the secret zone!&quot;Tails interupted.
<br />
&quot;If I may interupt,I have heard certain survivors recovered
<br />
them after the attack,&quot;Sally said.
<br />
&quot;Where'd' ya' hear that?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE!We can use it to track them down&quot;
<br />
Sally whipped out a pocket sized electronic device and
<br />
turned it on.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,search for emerald file,access,run data,evaluate.&quot;
<br />
&quot;The only emerald within the 10 mile radius range is in the
<br />
great forest,the only part of Mobious Robotnik stayed out
<br />
of,&quot;Nicole said.
<br />
&quot;Let's go!&quot;
<br />
&quot;NO!Not more speed,&quot;Antoine pleaded.
<br />
&quot;Hope you like dust,Ant!&quot;Sonic grabbed Antoine and Sally.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;*cough**cough*ACK!&quot;
<br />
A squirrely cough came from high above a tree.Sonic stopped.
<br />
A squirrel came down.
<br />
&quot;Stop kicking up so much dust!It should halfway to the moon,
<br />
now.Who are you,anyway?Sonic the Hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Oops,sorry.And that's probably Princess Sally...ha!&quot;
<br />
&quot;YES!IT IS!&quot;Sally was gritting her teeth.Sonic eyed the
<br />
emerald the squirrel was holding.
<br />
&quot;Would you,by any chance,want to join the fight against
<br />
Robotnik?&quot;He asked.
<br />
&quot;Sure.The name's Minerva.This should be a beautiful
<br />
relationship,royalty and heroism...&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 4:Cagey Caper
<br />
Sonic and Tails THOUGHT they killed Robotnik,until he
<br />
kidnapped Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck.Learning
<br />
about the attack that cleared Mobious,Sonic (with some new
<br />
friends) started the quest by finding the blue Chaos Emerald
<br />
and a squirrely ally,Minerva.
<br />
&quot;The red Chaos Emerald is west of this vicinity,in sector
<br />
9-3.&quot;NICOLE read.
<br />
&quot;That's an Aquatic Ruin!It's WAY too dangerous!&quot;Tails
<br />
remembered.After pointing this out,Antoine decided to stay
<br />
put.Then,without further hesitation,they took off.
<br />

<br />
Sally accessed some information about the Aquatic Ruins.
<br />
&quot;The Aquatic Ruins was an ancient city until it was
<br />
destroyed by Robotnik.There are readings of organic life on
<br />
it.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Organic life!Someone still lives!&quot;Minerva shouted.
<br />
However,the Aquatic Ruins was now a beach,with no signs of
<br />
anything.However,further inspection indicated a metallic
<br />
fish...RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM!It had a steel grate in front
<br />
and 4 fins.Suddenly,Sonic was sucked toward it.&quot;Don't worry,
<br />
I have a plan!&quot;Sonic started spinning,but then the grate
<br />
opened and Sonic,along with the others,were sucked in.Then
<br />
the &quot;fish&quot; returned to the surface.&quot;NO!That's not a
<br />
workerbot!&quot;A sea lion said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;That's the second time I was called a workerbot!WHAT is a
<br />
workerbot!&quot;Sonic said.
<br />
&quot;SONIC THE HEDGEHOG?!What are YOU doing here?&quot;the sea lion
<br />
aasked.
<br />
&quot;We came to find a very specific jewel...the red Chaos
<br />
Emerald.&quot;Sally explained.
<br />
&quot;OH!I use that to power my fish!You can have it if you need
<br />
it.My name's Rotor.I know Sonic,Tails,and you,but who's
<br />
the...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Squirrel?I'm Minerva.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Rotor,you are obviously against Robotnik.How would like to
<br />
join the Freedom Fighters?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Freedom Fighters?Since when were we called Freedom Fighters
<br />
Sally asked.
<br />
&quot;Since now.So,Rotor...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Okay.Sounds good!&quot;
<br />
&quot;There.Now,we have a fox waiting in the Great Forest...&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 5:Singing in the rain...of rocks!
<br />
Sonic and Tails saw Robotnik kidnap Sonic's brother Speed
<br />
and Uncle Chuck.After learning about his attack on Mobious
<br />
and recruiting some Freedom Fighters:Princess Sally,the
<br />
royal guard,Antoine,Minerva (a squirrel),and Rotor (a sea
<br />
lion mechanic),Sonic must find the last 4 Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
&quot;The Underground Zone!That's Robotnik's territory!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sonic,MOBIOUS is Robotnik's territory.&quot;Sally pointed out.
<br />
&quot;Sonic!I modified the hovercrafts I made before the attack.
<br />
We should be able to catch up with you!&quot;Rotor called.
<br />
&quot;Cool,Rote.Hang on tight,'cause we're going warp 7!&quot;
<br />
With that,Sonic,Tails,Sally,Minerva,and Rotor took off for
<br />
the Underground Zone (though Sonic was almost sure he forgot
<br />
something).
<br />

<br />
Once there,they found their first complication...the hover-
<br />
boards weren't working right.Sonic was able to get them off
<br />
before the hoverboards crashed...but Sonic and the others
<br />
landed in a mining cart going downward.They crashed,but no
<br />
harm was done.Then a moniter lowered from the ceiling,and
<br />
displayed Robotnik's face.&quot;Welcome,&quot;he said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I believe you are looking for this,&quot;the moniter raised to
<br />
reveal the green Chaos Emerald.&quot;If you want it take it...
<br />
although you will be smashed like a bug,&quot;then,a gate dropped
<br />
behind the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&quot;Well,I guess we have no choice!&quot;Sonic took the emerald.True
<br />
to Robotnik's word,the ceiling crumbled.
<br />
Suddenly,a kangaroo appeared and pushed away the falling
<br />
rocks.A rock fell over Minerva,and Sonic crushed it.Then the
<br />
kangaroo pushed away the rock about to crush Sonic.And then,
<br />
the last rock fell...right on Sally's leg!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hmmm.She'll be okay,as long as she stays off that leg,&quot;the
<br />
kangaroo said.
<br />
&quot;Well,she can't move around a lot.We need to get her in a
<br />
safe place,&quot;Rotor suggested.
<br />
&quot;THAT'S IT!THAT'S what I forgot...Antoine.&quot;Sonic suddenly
<br />
burst.
<br />
&quot;Say,isn't HE in a safe place?&quot;Minerva reminded.
<br />
&quot;We'll,let's go back...and take him with us.&quot;Sally was
<br />
anxious.
<br />
&quot;The name's Leaper.&quot;Leaper said.
<br />

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 6:Discovery of Knothole
<br />
Robotnik captured Sonic's brother Speed and Uncle Chuck,not
<br />
to mention most of Mobious.Not only that,but Sonic and
<br />
Tails,along with Sally,Antoine,Minerva,Rotor,and Leaper,must
<br />
collect the 6 Chaos Emeralds.At the moment,though,Sally's
<br />
leg is crushed and Antoine is lost!
<br />
Sonic,holding Sally,rushed into the Great Forest in search
<br />
of Antoine...and proper sanctuary.Sonic's luck shone,
<br />
however,when Antoine popped out of the bushes.
<br />
&quot;Sally,you must see this.It is magnifeec!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Magnificent,Antoine,magnificent,&quot;Sally corrected Antoine.
<br />
&quot;Oh,come on.&quot;
<br />
Antoine led Sonic and Sally to a village.Rotor,Minerva,and
<br />
Leaper met them on hovercrafts.
<br />
&quot;Ooo.Beaver cottages.How intriguing.&quot;Minerva said.
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,access beaver dwellings.Might as well know what
<br />
we're living in.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Accessing,Sally.No file on beaver dwellings.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Steady,steady,slow,slow...&quot;
<br />
&quot;I hate that word.&quot;
<br />
Sonic was in one of the huts,lowering Sally onto a bed.
<br />
&quot;There.I should be safe here.&quot;Sally said.
<br />
Sonic went outside.&quot;Tails,guard Sally while Rotor,Minerva,
<br />
Leaper,and I look for the last 3 emeralds.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes,Sonic.No creepy 'bot will get past me.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Cool.Now,I'm...wait,I almost forgot.&quot;
<br />
Sonic went inside and grabbed NICOLE.&quot;Mind if I borrow
<br />
this?&quot;
<br />
&quot;No.&quot;Sally answered.
<br />
&quot;Okay.If you need anything,tell Tails.See ya'!&quot;

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 7:Sonic Spinball
<br />
Robotnik wiped out Mobious except a few survivors.
<br />
Sonic has collected the blue,red,and green Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
Sonic needs the pink,l.blue,and purple emeralds.
<br />
Sonic has 3 new friends:Minerva,Rotor,and Leaper.
<br />
Sally is hiding in Knothole with Tails and Antoine guarding.
<br />
&quot;MAYDAY,MAYDAY.Unknown user.&quot;
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,It's Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Accessing Sonic.Commencing voice comparison.Hello,Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Now how does Sally do this.Hmmm.NICOLE,scan for Chaos
<br />
Emeralds.&quot;
<br />
&quot;No emeralds in range,Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Do you think they're in the secret zone,guys?&quot;asked Sonic.
<br />
&quot;It seems possible,but we don't know yet,&quot;Rotor replied.
<br />
&quot;There's only one way to find out.NICOLE,scan for
<br />
trans-dimensional warps.&quot;
<br />
&quot;There are 2 in range.Warp #1 leads to Earth,a terran planet
<br />
Warp #2 leads to the secret zone.&quot;
<br />
&quot;NICOLE,show coordinates of warp #2.&quot;NICOLE projected a
<br />
holographic map of Mobious in the 100-mile radius range.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well,Sonic,it's now or never.&quot;Minerva said.
<br />
&quot;And it's now.BANZAI!&quot;Sonic leaped into the warp with the
<br />
others following.Sonic was spinning,jumping,and leaping off
<br />
platforms in no time.Rotor slid on his belly directly into
<br />
the goal,and disappeared.Leaper tried to hit the gate with
<br />
his head by bouncing off the bumpers...but when he got
<br />
there,the maze spun 180' degrees,and Leaper hit the goal.
<br />
When Minerva finally gained her balance,she used her tail to
<br />
save Sonic from the goal...but after that she slipped again
<br />
and fell into the goal herself.However,the gate on Sonic's
<br />
side was gone and he hit the emerald,then disappeared.Sonic
<br />
joined the other Freedom Fighters on Mobious...with a pink
<br />
emerald in hand.
<br />

<br />

Next:2 more 2 go!

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 8:Sonic vs. Thunder
<br />
Sorry,there is too little space to print the reminder.You
<br />
should know by now.
<br />
&quot;The yellow Chaos Emerald is in sector
<br />
1,2,4,8,16,32,OVERLOAD!&quot;
<br />
Just then,something tackled Sonic.He woke up to find a neon
<br />
blue hedgehog,also knocked out cold,holding an emerald.Sonic
<br />
was just about to grab it when he was electricuted.
<br />
&quot;I don't think so.You're going to have to earn my emerald...
<br />
in a race.&quot;
<br />
&quot;A race.Don't you know who I am?&quot;Sonic asked.
<br />
&quot;Dead meat!The destination is Green Hill.&quot;
<br />
Sonic and Thunder got ready.
<br />
&quot;We start on three.Ready...THREE!&quot;
<br />
Both hegehogs were off.However,the stranger got ahead of
<br />
Sonic by 1 foot per second.Sonic knew that Green Hill wasn't
<br />
exactly around the corner.He thought of Green Hill and his
<br />
last moments with Uncle Chuck,gazing at the power ring...
<br />

<br />
THE POWER RING!It was still in Sonic's backpack,and in great
<br />
shape.Sonic got it out,and focused on it's power.Sonic shot
<br />
out at warp 2...twice the other hedgehog's speed.
<br />
Startled,the other hedgehog shot a lightning bolt from his
<br />
fingers,which hit Sonic's power ring.It absorbed the power,
<br />
sending Sonic warp 3.Not only that,the shot made the neon
<br />
hedgehog fall to see Sonic standing on top of Green Hill.
<br />

<br />
Sonic met up with the other Freedom Fighters,then carried
<br />
them to where the glow-in-the-dark pincushion &lt;G&gt; fell.They
<br />
coaxed him to talk.&quot;I was captured by Robotnik.I was due
<br />
after some other old hedgehog was robotisized.But right
<br />
before the process was completed,he messed up the control
<br />
box.He was robotisized,but I was electrified.&quot;
<br />
&quot;What's your name?&quot;Minerva asked.
<br />
&quot;I don't know.I didn't know anything until the emerald made
<br />
me remember the essentials.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well,I name you Lightning,after that SHOCKING display of
<br />
power.&quot;Rotor cracked.He didn't know Lightning would accept
<br />
the name.He also joined the Freedom Fighters...though
<br />
everybody expected that.
<br />

<br />

<br />
P.S.Kate,you're coming in next time,so be patient!

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 9:Kate's Creation
<br />
If you don't know what's going on,WHY THE HECK ARE YOU
<br />
READING THIS STORY!Don't worry,you'll eventually catch on!
<br />
Sonic didn't have time to check with NICOLE.Immediatly,when
<br />
the emeralds got close to each other,they flew away...with
<br />
Sonic trying not to get ahead!
<br />

<br />
The emeralds went into Sonic's hut.Then they started banging
<br />
on Chuck's closet.Sonic never opened the closet...it was
<br />
forbidden.But Sonic,and the other Freedom Fighters opened it
<br />
and saw a white Chaos Emerald...the final emerald.And was in
<br />
Sonic's house!Why didn't Chuck tell him.Then,it started
<br />
speaking...
<br />
&quot;Where have you five been?&quot;It said.The Freedom Fighters were
<br />
too surprised to comment.
<br />
&quot;Oh,I can talk.That feels good.Thanks!&quot;The red one said.
<br />
&quot;Aren't you going to introduce me to your friends?&quot;The white
<br />
one asked.
<br />
&quot;We don't know them.They should introduce themselves to
<br />
us...of course,we all know Sonic.&quot;the yellow said.
<br />
&quot;I'm M-m-minerva,not too mention one scared squirrel girl!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Rotor,a handyman.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Leaper...KEEP AWAY!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm Lightning...or am I?Oh,I get so scrambled sometimes.&quot;
<br />
&quot;Well,I am the white Chaos Emerald,head of language.See why
<br />
the others didn't talk before?&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the red emerald,head of power...If Rotor didn't use me
<br />
as a battery.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the yellow emerald,head of knowledge.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the pink emerald and all I do is transportation.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I'm the green emerald,the height choice!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I create things,take for instance Mobious.And now,I think,
<br />
is a time for creation...&quot;
<br />
&quot;NOT ANOTHER BEING!REMEMBER LAST TIME?&quot;the yellow bellowed.
<br />
&quot;Relax.We'll start this one's life as an adult.&quot;
<br />
The emeralds gathered in a circle and spun.Then they gave
<br />
off a charge to the middle.It took shape and then the energy
<br />
turned into a human,which dropped on the ground.
<br />
&quot;Darn.She's only 11.&quot;The pink commented.
<br />
&quot;It's alright.If she's not defective now,she won't be later.
<br />
Remember...&quot;the yellow was interupted.
<br />
&quot;No,I refuse to remember.Let bygones be bygones.&quot;Pink said.
<br />
The human got up.&quot;Hello.I'm,I'm...who am I?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Kate.Kate Chaos.And,you're not a rebel...thank goodness!&quot;
<br />
Then,the door shattered,and Robotnik stepped in...

Act 1:The Attack and the Recovery
<br />
Part 4:Escape from Robotropolis
<br />
Filled with anger,Sonic charged at the man who captured his
<br />
family.The,he was captured by nets from tall,dark robots.
<br />
&quot;Ah,Sonic.I see you've met my SWAT-bots,&quot;Robotnik smirked...
<br />
The red emerald flew into Kate's hand.She aimed it at a
<br />
SWAT-bot,and an energy bolt zapped it.The SWAT-bot was
<br />
destroyed.Then,the wall broke down.Millions of SWAT-bots
<br />
were in front of the hut.Lightning and Kate zapped all they
<br />
could,but they eventually ran out of juice.The Freedom
<br />
Fighters were overcome.
<br />

<br />
By listening to Robotnik's babbling,Sonic learned they were
<br />
in Robotropolis...dark and polluted.They were carried off to
<br />
be robotisized and turned into workerbots.Sonic still didn't
<br />
know what workerbots were.
<br />
&quot;After you learn your fate,you will become my mindless
<br />
slaves.I'll start with you,Speed,&quot;Robotnik decided.
<br />
&quot;I'm Sonic I tell you.Speed wouldn't have had so many
<br />
allys.&quot;
<br />
&quot;It doesn't matter.You'll both be hedgehogs with bolts in
<br />
your neck...&quot;CRASH!Robotnik was interupted by something
<br />
shaking the tower in which the Freedom Fighters were
<br />
imprisoned.&quot;What was that?&quot;
<br />
Robotnik looked out the window.He saw a purple hedgehogs
<br />
spiny head.A cambot spyed on it,and Robotnik monitered the
<br />
mysterious hedgehog close-up.And then the hedgehog found it.
<br />
&quot;Don't look behind you,&quot;he warned.Robotnik looked at the
<br />
elevator.There,at the ready with lasers,were Sally and
<br />
Tails.Sally gave Robotnik a blast that knocked him back a
<br />
little.&quot;That's for my leg.HEY!&quot;Sally was grabbed by a
<br />
SWAT-bot.Tails blasted it,and then a transport-bot crashed
<br />
through the window right into the robotisizer controls!
<br />
The hedgehog stepped out.He looked exactly like Sonic,but he
<br />
was smaller and purple.&quot;Hello,am I late?Oh,it doesn't
<br />
matter.&quot;Then,he pulled the jail bar switch and the Freedom
<br />
Fighters were free.
<br />

<br />
There wasn't much time for questions.The elevator arrived
<br />
with 3 SWAT-bots,and flybots were attacking.Kate and
<br />
Lightning blasted bots.Minerva used Tails's blaster (which
<br />
she was skilled with).Rotor used his screwdriver and slashed
<br />
the SWAT-bots.Sonic,Tails,and the guest of honor spun
<br />
through the flybots.Laser shots filled the tower.
<br />
Robotnik escaped through the trashed transport-bot.More
<br />
flybots and more SWAT-bots entered.Finally,Rotor whipped out
<br />
his remote control for the hovercrafts and called them.
<br />
&quot;Who are you?&quot;Sonic asked the hedgehog.
<br />
&quot;Just call me Hedgehog X.WHOA!&quot;the ledge Hedgehog X backed
<br />
into crumbled,taking him with it.Then the hoverboards
<br />
arrived and the Freedom Fighters made a retreat.
<br />
&quot;Friends,&quot;Sally started,&quot;we did a lot today.We banded
<br />
together to stop Robotnik.We formed the FREEDOM FIGHTERS!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yah,we did a lot today.Let's go home and take a rest.&quot;Sonic
<br />
suggested.And they did just that.END OF ACT 1     Hedgehog X

Subject: Sonic '95? (was: Re: STHMMMX)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wrote a story for Sonic '95, too, but the problem is, it's too big to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; even import it one book at a time, and I'm too tired to do anything else!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Growing old is mandatory.  Growing up is optional.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />

<br />
What, pray tell, is Sonic '95?  (Looks like I came in on the middle of a
<br />
thread).  The last time I tried my hand at fanfic, I had to post it in
<br />
12 installments.  So how big is big?  Details, I want details!

Looks like there are some other old codgers on the list with me after
<br />
all!  My own odometer rolled up 43 years last December.  I don't know
<br />
how old Jim or Bob are, but there's my claim to &quot;oldest fanboy&quot; honors.
<br />

<br />
BTW, I'm clueless about #26 so far; apparently the distribution network
<br />
isn't too prompt about shipping to southwest lower Michigan -- or at
<br />
least, my corner of it.  #25 only reached here the beginning of June, so
<br />
I expect #26 will be catching my eye by the 4th of July.
<br />

<br />
Let me know when they announce the Bunnie miniseries.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Hi, I'm Thad &quot;X&quot; Boyd, and I'm new at the Mailing List thing.  I couldn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; find any FAQ, so I'm trying to get through to the rest of you.  Hopefully,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sending this to the right address...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
You want a FAQ?  Happy to oblige.  I, BTW, am the keeper of the FAQ
<br />
File...or one of the files, at any rate, having had to split this one
<br />
into three.  Hope you enjoy.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess I may as well tell you a little about myself.  I'm on the Fraudigy
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (I guess you'd call it Prodigy if you hadn't seen any bills yet &lt;G&gt;)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; network, and have fairly limited Internet access.  I'm a member of two
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sonic clubs (for those of you who run *Fee*, if any, one's in the Sega
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Clubs topic on the Video Games BB; the other's in the Cartoon/Furry/Humor
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; topic on the Comics BB), and I write a lot of stories about the Freedom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fighters.  In Sonic '95 (the one on the VGBB), we've made up a multitude of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; new characters (or, in my case, stolen some from other areas that have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with Sonic...my character is Mega Man X).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;&lt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />

<br />
Turnabout being fair play:
<br />

<br />
I access the Internet through a connection at the university where I
<br />
work (I work in the library, and as a professional librarian with
<br />
faculty rank I get an e-mail outlet).  I am not a member of any clubs,
<br />
and the local sysop has locked out all the alt.fan.*  groups, so I have
<br />
to resort to the mailing list.  Why I took it upon myself to do the FAQ
<br />
File I'll never know but it's a great experience.  Having merely read
<br />
about the process of the canonization of the Old Testament in a course I
<br />
took on Intertestamental Judaism, I find it fascinating that there are
<br />
parallels in the currently-ongoing work of putting together the StH
<br />
canon.
<br />

<br />
My one contribution to fanfic, &quot;Bloodlines,&quot; is available for viewing on
<br />
David Pistone's web page.  The original characters in that one are
<br />
products of my own imagination.  I'm going to try posting another story
<br />
some time in July.
<br />

<br />
Looking forward to having you on the list.
<br />
We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.

<br />
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
<br />
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
<br />
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
<br />
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
<br />

<br />
Sally.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sonic's Nightmare
<br />
Writer: Frank Santopadre
<br />
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
<br />
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
<br />

Writer: Matt Uitz

energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
<br />
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
<br />
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
<br />
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
<br />
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
<br />
Mobius.
<br />

<br />
Harmonic Sonic

<br />
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
<br />
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
<br />
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
<br />
mistake at the end of the second season?
<br />

<br />
Sub-Sonic
<br />
Writer: Barbara Slade
<br />
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
<br />
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
<br />
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
<br />
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.
<br />

<br />
Heads or Tails
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
<br />
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
<br />
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
<br />
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
<br />
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
<br />
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Past Cool
<br />
Writers: Kayte Kuch &amp; Sheryl Scarborough
<br />
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
<br />
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from

Robotnik.
<br />

<br />

<br />

robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
<br />

<br />
generator.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Second Season: 1994-95
<br />

<br />
Game Guy
<br />
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
<br />
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
<br />
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
<br />
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
<br />
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
<br />
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
<br />
about a list of other freedom fighters.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Conversion
<br />
To my way of thinking, THE breakthrough episode for the series! 
<br />
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
<br />
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
<br />
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
<br />
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
<br />
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
<br />
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
<br />
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
<br />
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.
<br />

<br />
No Brainer
<br />
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
<br />
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
<br />
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
<br />
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.
<br />

<br />
Blast to the Past (two parts)
<br />
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
<br />
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
<br />
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
<br />
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
<br />
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
<br />
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
<br />
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
<br />
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
<br />
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
<br />
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
would not get captured.
<br />

<br />
Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
<br />
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made &quot;king&quot;
<br />
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
<br />
&quot;honor&quot; of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
<br />
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
<br />
ineptitude.
<br />

<br />
Dulcy
<br />
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
<br />
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
<br />
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
<br />
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
<br />
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
<br />
time to hatch the egg.
<br />

<br />
The Void
<br />
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the &quot;Great
<br />
Unknown&quot; [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
<br />
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
<br />
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
<br />
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
<br />
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
<br />
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
<br />
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
<br />
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
<br />
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
<br />
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
<br />
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
<br />
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
<br />
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
<br />
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.
<br />

<br />
The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
<br />
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
<br />
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
<br />
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
<br />
for Antoine.
<br />

<br />
Cry of the Wolf
<br />
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
<br />
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
<br />
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
<br />
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
<br />
a lightning storm and destroys it.
<br />

<br />
Drood Henge
<br />
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
<br />
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
<br />
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
<br />
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
<br />
can get to it.
<br />

<br />
Spyhog
<br />
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
<br />
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
<br />
back underground with a different cover.
<br />

<br />
Doomsday
<br />
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
<br />
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
<br />
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
<br />
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
<br />
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
<br />
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
<br />
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
<br />
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
<br />
season.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
<br />

<br />
[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />

<br />
Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
<br />
original Sonic miniseries:
<br />

<br />
Issue 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't Cry For Me, Mobius&quot;
<br />
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
<br />
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
<br />
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
<br />
referred to as &quot;Boomer.&quot;)  Antoine then announces that there is a
<br />
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
<br />
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
<br />
ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Royal Family of Mobius&quot;
<br />
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
<br />
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
<br />
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
<br />
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
<br />
the freedom fighters in Knothole.
<br />

<br />
Issue 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Run, Sally, Run&quot;
<br />
Story and art: Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
<br />
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
<br />
and almost throws her into the &quot;Robo-machine.&quot;  Sonic rescues
<br />
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
<br />
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
<br />
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.
<br />

<br />
Issue 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Crowning Achievement&quot;
<br />
Gallagher &amp; Shaw! again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally decides to wear the &quot;Crown of the Acorn Kings&quot; which
<br />
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
<br />
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
<br />
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
<br />
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
<br />
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Issue 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Flashback&quot;
<br />
Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
<br />
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
<br />
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
<br />
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
<br />
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Ask Spy&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
<br />
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
<br />
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
<br />
destroys the factory.
<br />

<br />
[Summary by Erich Schulman]
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sonic Under Glass&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
<br />
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
<br />
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
<br />
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
<br />
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
<br />
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
<br />
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
<br />
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
<br />
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
<br />
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
<br />
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
<br />
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
<br />

<br />
&quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
<br />
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
<br />
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
<br />
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
<br />
spin, he lands on &quot;undersea bank heist.&quot;  Robotnik's lackey's
<br />
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
<br />
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
<br />
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
<br />
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
<br />
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
<br />
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
<br />
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
<br />
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
<br />
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!]; that Sonic was just a
<br />
little slow rescuing Bunnie from the roboticizer.  On a more
<br />
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
<br />
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
<br />
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#18 [Jan 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
<br />
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
<br />
plans an attack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;
<br />
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
<br />
&quot;First Star....&quot;, #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
<br />
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
<br />
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork
<br />

<br />
Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally's Crusade: The Quest&quot;
<br />
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
<br />
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
<br />
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
<br />
spelled out in a &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of the story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mirror Zone&quot;
<br />
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as &quot;about 15.&quot;  [Note, if
<br />
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Tallest Tale&quot;
<br />
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
<br />
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
<br />
Shaw!.
<br />

<br />
#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.
<br />

<br />
#20 [Mar 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
<br />
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): &quot;Give Mobius
<br />
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;
<br />
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
<br />
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
<br />
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.
<br />

<br />
#21 [Apr 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;3 Phases of E.V.E&quot;
<br />
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
<br />
E.V.E. [&quot;exceptionally versatile evolvoid&quot;] to capture Sonic.  As
<br />
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
<br />
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
<br />
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
<br />
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
<br />
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
<br />
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
<br />
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
<br />
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
<br />
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
<br />
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#22 [May 1995]
<br />
&quot;The Return,&quot; written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &amp;
<br />
Harvey M.
<br />

<br />
The story opens with Sonic &amp; Sally MCW (Married with Children;
<br />
cf. the end of &quot;Sally's Quest&quot; in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &amp;
<br />
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
<br />
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
<br />
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
<br />
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
<br />
talking with Robo-Robotnik from &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics,&quot;
<br />
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
<br />
(hereinafter &quot;R-R&quot;) remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
<br />
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
<br />
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
<br />
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
<br />
&quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; himself to keep from being ruler over
<br />
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: &quot;You owe
<br />
me!&quot;  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
<br />
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
<br />
artwork.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tails Knighttime Story,&quot; written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
<br />
Manak &amp; John Dagostino.
<br />

<br />
As Tails grumps about &quot;get[ting] baby-sat&quot; while Sonic has all
<br />
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
<br />
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who &quot;borrows&quot; his
<br />
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
<br />
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
<br />
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
<br />

<br />
Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
<br />
pepper them with questions (most are answered: &quot;Keep reading.&quot; 
<br />
Translation: &quot;we're working on it!&quot;).  The cover of Princess
<br />
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
<br />
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the &quot;creative
<br />
differences&quot; theory in Q7.
<br />

<br />
#23   [Jun 1995]
<br />
&quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
<br />
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
<br />
save Robotnik from &quot;disposal,&quot; Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
<br />
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.
<br />

<br />
Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
<br />
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
<br />
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
<br />
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
<br />
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
<br />
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
<br />
not going to reveal.
<br />

&quot;Vol-ANT-teer&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
<br />
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
<br />
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
<br />
isn't exactly clueless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
<br />
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
<br />
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
<br />
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
#24  [Jul 1995]
<br />
&quot;When Hedgehogs Collide&quot; (in 4 parts)
<br />
Script: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski
<br />
(Parts 3 and 4)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
<br />
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
<br />
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from &quot;The Good, The
<br />
Bad and the Hedgehog&quot; [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
<br />
&quot;the Antisonic,&quot; as in &quot;the Antichrist&quot;) is looking for some
<br />
action, so he rounds up the &quot;gang&quot; consisting of the Antisally,
<br />
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
<br />
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
<br />
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
<br />
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot; though they were unable to penetrate &quot;the Zone
<br />
of Silence&quot; (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
<br />
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
<br />
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
<br />
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
<br />
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
<br />
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
<br />
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
<br />
strategies.  So it's &quot;Change partners!&quot; as play is resumed: Sonic
<br />
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
<br />
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
<br />
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
<br />
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
<br />
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
<br />
peacefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
<br />
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
<br />
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
<br />
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
<br />
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
<br />
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
<br />
the work and &quot;kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!&quot;  At least,
<br />
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
<br />
to...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a &quot;Sonic + Bunnie&quot; graffiti
<br />
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sally,&quot; &quot;Sonic + Nicole&quot;--THAT I'd like to see!--and &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sonic&quot;], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
<br />
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
<br />
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
<br />
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
<br />
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
<br />
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
<br />
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGram: information on two upcoming &quot;special&quot; issues: the
<br />
48-page Sonic &amp; Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
<br />
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
<br />
the &quot;Silver Anniversary&quot; issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
<br />
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of &quot;Do-It-
<br />
Yourself Sonic Contest&quot; winners who have moved and left no
<br />
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
<br />
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles 48 page special
<br />
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
<br />
&quot;Panic in the Sky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobians living on the western shore of &quot;the Great
<br />
Continent&quot; [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
<br />
another adjective besides &quot;Great&quot;: viz.: the Great Forest, the
<br />
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the &quot;all-purpose&quot;
<br />
use of the word _hriar_, or &quot;thousands&quot; by rabbits in Richard
<br />
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
<br />
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
<br />
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
<br />
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
<br />
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
<br />
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
<br />
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
<br />
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
<br />
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
<br />
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
<br />
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
<br />
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
<br />
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Robotnik is &quot;hijacking&quot; the island by
<br />
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
<br />
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
<br />
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
<br />
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
<br />
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
<br />
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
<br />
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
<br />
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).
<br />

<br />
But Knuckles replaces the &quot;real&quot; Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
<br />
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
<br />
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
<br />
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
<br />
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
<br />
&quot;Fire Drill&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
<br />
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
<br />
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
<br />
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
<br />
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
<br />
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
<br />
check out the Sonic-Gram in issue #23 for a hint.
<br />
&quot;Lord of the Floating Island&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
<br />
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
<br />
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
<br />
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
<br />
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
<br />
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
<br />
Knuckles' exit line: &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect
<br />
and serve!&quot;  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
<br />
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
<br />
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
<br />
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
<br />
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
<br />
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
<br />
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
<br />

<br />
#25
<br />
&quot;Go Ahead...Mecha My Day&quot; (the only story in this issue)
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher
<br />
Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
based on summary by James Firmiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
<br />
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a &quot;zone portal.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
<br />
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
<br />
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
<br />
terms: &quot;Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
<br />
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
<br />
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
<br />
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
<br />
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
<br />
much of a bustline in issue #21!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
<br />
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
<br />
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.

<br />
Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary by Ron Bauerle
<br />
&quot;Deadliest of the Species!&quot; written by Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken
<br />
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski.
<br />

<br />
Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
<br />
describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is renouned for
<br />
his military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
<br />
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.
<br />

<br />
Sally &amp; Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
<br />
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
<br />
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
<br />
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
<br />
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
<br />
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
<br />
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
<br />
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
<br />
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.
<br />

<br />
The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
<br />
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
<br />
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
<br />
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
<br />
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
<br />
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
<br />
glass case: Sally!?
<br />

<br />
Also some fan art: two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie (both NBD), and one
<br />
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Miniseries #2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
<br />
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
<br />
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
<br />
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
<br />
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
<br />
volunteers to stay with him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
<br />
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
<br />
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
<br />
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
<br />
opposed), and they never show up again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
<br />
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
<br />
Sally to Robotnik.
<br />

<br />
Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
<br />
Will Sonic and Sally marry? &quot;Could be.&quot;  Has Sally met Knuckles?
<br />
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&amp;K special.  Does Sally have a
<br />
mother, and if so what does she look like? &quot;Of course...her
<br />
origin may yet be told.&quot;  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
<br />
it in &quot;Bloodlines&quot; in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.

<br />
&quot;Deadliest of the Species, Part III&quot;
<br />
Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
(Summary: James Firmiss)
<br />

<br />
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
<br />
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
<br />
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
<br />
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
<br />
Sally rescues him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
<br />
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
<br />
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
<br />
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
<br />
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
<br />
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
<br />
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
<br />
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
<br />
St. John.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
<br />
blows up because a &quot;feedback loop&quot; has occurred.  Something which
<br />
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
<br />
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
<br />
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
<br />
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
<br />
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
<br />
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
<br />
&quot;moles&quot;.  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
<br />
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
<br />
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
<br />
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
<br />
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
<br />
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
<br />
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
<br />
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
<br />
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
<br />
serious lip-locking before they part.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
<br />
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
<br />
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
<br />
leader of the &quot;Rebel Underground&quot; and acted as a double agent in
<br />
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
<br />
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
<br />
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
<br />
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
<br />
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
<br />
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
<br />
was an automated Sally:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the real Sally always called him &quot;Mr. St. John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
<br />
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
<br />
replaced by a robot double.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
<br />
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
<br />
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
<br />
unexpected happened.
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
<br />
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats....&quot;  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
<br />
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
<br />
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
<br />
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
<br />
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
<br />
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
<br />
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
<br />
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
<br />
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
<br />
address is princess_at_frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
<br />
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
<br />
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
<br />
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot;
<br />
description:
<br />

<br />
Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
<br />
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
<br />
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
<br />
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
<br />
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
<br />
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
<br />
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
<br />
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
<br />
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
<br />
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
<br />
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
<br />
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
<br />
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
<br />
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
<br />
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: &quot;Eight years
<br />
passed.&quot;  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
<br />
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
<br />
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
<br />
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chuck&quot; and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
<br />
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
<br />
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
<br />
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
<br />
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
<br />
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
<br />
encounters &quot;a cute little chipmunk girl&quot;: Princess Sally Acorn. 
<br />
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the &quot;Ro-Bo-Machine.&quot;  Ch. 7:
<br />
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
<br />
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
<br />
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
<br />
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
<br />
them to &quot;Knothole Village&quot; which is &quot;under the forest floor.&quot;
<br />
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
<br />
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
<br />
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
<br />
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
<br />
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
<br />
above), which conflicts with &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; and, in fact, the
<br />
rest of the second season.

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?

Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like he wants to

around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from falling into

a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;

in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
<br />
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
<br />
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
<br />
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
<br />
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
<br />
there is no &quot;official&quot; explanation as to how Tails got that way,
<br />
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
<br />
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
<br />
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
<br />
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
<br />
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
<br />
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
<br />
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
<br />
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
<br />
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
<br />
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
<br />
Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
<br />
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
<br />
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
<br />
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
<br />
Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series
<br />
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
<br />
indicate that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative
<br />
differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally miniseries began
<br />
shipping the week of Feb 13.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
<br />
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about &quot;The
<br />
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
<br />
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />
like:
<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
<br />
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
<br />
Plausible and has the facts on its side: after the November sweeps, ABC
<br />
moved StH to 8:00 am (Eastern) so it was opposite &quot;Dog City&quot; on Fox.
<br />
But just in time for the February sweeps, Fox shifted MMPR to 8:00.
<br />
More effective than any Doomsday device, unfortunately.
<br />
Source for this
<br />
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics, as posted
<br />
to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
<br />
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
<br />
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
<br />
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
<br />
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
<br />
you say &quot;anal retentive&quot;?).  Words were exchanged and the show
<br />
was effectively cancelled.
<br />
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
<br />
of &quot;two seasons and out&quot; for shows.  Though it's possible that
<br />
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
<br />
to begin with.
