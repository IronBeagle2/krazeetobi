<br />
This night I did a brief excursion into FurToonia and really found some
<br />
places dedicated to our favourite blue speedster. There is a whole  
<br />
Knothole Village as well as a part of the Great Forest there. Sonic also  
<br />
inhabits Room 102 at the UnderGround Apartments.
<br />

<br />
I'm posting some parts of my logfile to show you what I found:

</em><br />

<br />
Sonic's Game Pad
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;Sonic keeps a very simple room here in the Underground Apartments,
<br />
since he considers it a temporary location.  He has most of his SONIC
<br />
the Hedgehog posters rolled up except for a new SONIC the Hedgehog 3
<br />
poster which takes up the entire wall opposite to the entrance.
<br />
&nbsp;Sonic has everything in boxes except for his monitor and Sega CD which
<br />
are setup right at the base of his bed.

<br />
Hallway (Sonic's Room, Sef's Room, Tails' Room and Rotor's Room)
<br />

<br />
You look around this section of this relatively long hallway and notice
<br />
that all the doors down the hallway have a wooden sign with their
<br />
resident's name on it.  To your west a sign on a door reads &quot;SONIC&quot; and
<br />
one on an adjacent door to it another one reads &quot;SEF.&quot;  To your east
<br />
hangs similar signs, one reads &quot;TAILS&quot; and an adjacent door's sign
<br />
reads &quot;ROTOR.&quot;  The hallway continues to the north and a sign over a
<br />
doorway to the south says, &quot;KNOTHOLE VILLAGE HUB.&quot;  You notice that
<br />
Sonic's door is unlocked and almost seems inviting.
<br />

<br />
You walk through the doorway into Tails' Room.
<br />

<br />
Tails' Room
<br />

<br />
This room belongs to Miles, better known as Tails.  There's a big
<br />
beanbag in the corner, and a bag of candy on the desk in the corner.
<br />
He has posters all over the walls, including one big one of his pal
<br />
Sonic!  On the back side of the door is a dartboard with Dr. Robotnik's
<br />
picture on it, perforated with little holes.  Four darts poke out of it.

</em><br />

<br />
This is Miles &quot;Tails&quot; Prower, a Freedom Fighter from the ever-popular &quot;Sonic
<br />
The Hedgehog&quot;.  He is a red fox, about three feet high, with russet-bronze
<br />
fur and a white underbelly.  In fact, he looks just like a normal red fox
<br />
except for the two bushy white-tipped tails straying lazily back and forth
<br />
behind him.  He is wearing a pair of white gloves and large, red &amp; white
<br />
sneakers on his feet.  His ears perk up, and he gives you a quirky grin.
<br />
Tails loves to help his best friend Sonic by traveling to diffe
<br />
rent places on planet Mobius and unroboticizing all it's furries.

You walk through the doorway into Sonic's Room and look around at the
<br />
walls around you plastered with SEGA posters (mostly of Sonic himself).
<br />

<br />
Sonic's Room
<br />

<br />
You look around Sonic the Hedgehog's room.  On the south wall there
<br />
are a slew of Sega posters, most of which are Sonic the hedgehog
<br />
and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 posters.  There's even a new one of Sonic
<br />
the Hedgehog 3 dominating the room's west wall.  To the north of
<br />
the room there is a bed adorned with Sonic the Hedgehog bed
<br />
sheets and a small shelf covered with small pewter statues of
<br />
Sonic, Tails, Princess Sally, Antoine and Rotor.  The door to
<br />
the east is adorned with a giant Princess Sally pin-up Sonic took
<br />
from the Sonic the Hedgehog comic (Issue #2, Sept.1993).

<br />
The Phantom has dark, seductive eyes.  Her soft blonde hair is all one length
<br />
and hovers gently at her shoulders.  She almost always has a dazzling smile
<br />
on her face.  As you stare obsessively at her, Phantom gives you one of her
<br />
radiant smiles and you notice her glittering sharp fangs..
<br />
Phantom is wearing a cute pair of Garfield silk boxer shorts and a matching
<br />
Garfield tee-shirt.  She has a soft plaid (purple and black and dark green)
<br />
Mickey Mouse hat on her head. There is a mischevious little gleam in her
<br />
eyes as she gazes intensely at you...

Hallway (Knuckles' Room and Julia's Room)
<br />

<br />
Looking around this section of the hallway, you notice a wooden sign on
<br />
each door to the east and west, the one to the east reads, &quot;VACANT&quot; and
<br />
the one to the west reads, &quot;VACANT.&quot;  There appears to be a door set on
<br />
the ground with the name &quot;KNUCKLES&quot; engraved on it, and a hatch in the
<br />
ceiling with the name &quot;JULIA&quot; engraved in the wood.  The hallway extends
<br />
further north and south.
