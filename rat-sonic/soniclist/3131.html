I know this may be considered as off-topic, but I feel that this is an issue
<br />
which warrants a discussion about the rules here.
<br />
As many, if not all, of you know, I am currently in the process of writing a
<br />
fan-fic called Hearts of Steel.  The story is about Mecha-Sonic being freed
<br />
from Robotnik and joining the Freedom Fighters (if you want the full preview,
<br />
just check my first post).  Imagine how disappointed and upset I was to find
<br />
that someone had written a story using almost the same title and plot; I
<br />
announced Hearts of Steel about 2-3 weeks ago, and this story was added
<br />
between Monday afternoon and today.  By now I'm sure that some of you are
<br />
jumping up and down to tell me that this could just be a coincidence, but I
<br />
find that hard to believe.  I will not give the author or title, but I will
<br />
say that the title was similar enough that if you replaced one word with the
<br />
word &quot;of&quot;, and switched the order around, you would get my title.  The plot
<br />
was way too similar (almost exactly the same), and the fact that it was just
<br />
uploaded makes me very suspicious that this is a minor case of plagiarism
<br />
that we're dealing with here, which makes me rather upset and angry. This
<br />
makes me very reluctant to share my ideas again, since I always thought that
<br />
it was safe to give a short preview of your stories without worrying that
<br />
they will be copied.  I thought we had a sort of code of honesty here! I am
<br />
writing this as a hope that the author will see this and feel at least a
<br />
little guilty for what they did and also to try and help prevent this sort of
<br />
thing from happening in the future. =(
<br />

<br />
P.S. to the author: You're welcome to use my ideas, but I wish that you had
<br />
let me know first! =(
<br />
