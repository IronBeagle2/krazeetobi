<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It is ridiculous for you to assume that I owe you this service. Lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciation like this makes me wish I had shut it down sooner. Though I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; only hope you and your attitude is in the minority.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Rat, let's be sensable: the government, (for example,) doesn't OWE us 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Yes, the government owes us. But I guess you don't pay taxes yet. Would you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like to pay me taxes? If you paid me, and I didn't follow through on the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; agreement, then you would have reason to bitch. Otherwise, shut the hell up.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm sick of hearing this.
</em><br />

<br />
I'll pay you.  If you keep this list up, I'll pay you.  Strike your 
<br />
price.  (reasonable)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt; It doesn't matter anyway since the list is going away soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You don't seem to care.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It's pointless to try to enforce list policy when there is about to be no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list. And I do care, otherwise I would have just shut the list down without
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; warning. Ever consider that?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; You always (have had) this chip on your shoulder.  Mind explaining why?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; It just upsets me when people forget that this is a free service that I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; providing, and refuse to respect that. People still post binaries and fan
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction regardless of how much I bitched about it. And I get &quot;how dare that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mean ratman tell me not to do this&quot;.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The reaction to me shutting the list down makes me even more bitter. I don't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; owe any of you anything. And after seeing some of the flames and personal
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attacks against me, I wish I had known about those people so I could have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; banned them from the list sooner. As much as people don't like the fact, this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; list is on MY server, and if people don't like it, they can get the hell out.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't have to explain why, it is my decision. This is not a democracy.  For
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; example, if EVERYONE wrote me and said they wanted fanfic to be permitted to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be posted, do you think I would allow it? I don't think so. But this is all a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; moot point since this list will be no more. 
</em><br />

<br />
You're right about one thing, that IS rather bitter! :)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The upside to this, is nobody HAS TO be here. If everyone hated the way I 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ran things, someone else could make their own mailing list, and everyone 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would join that.
</em><br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I'll try not to let the flames get me down, I did see a few nice
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thank-you's from people. I do appreciate it.
</em><br />

<br />
probably not me.  After all, I just want what's best for 
<br />
everybody-including YOU!   So, what do you say...?  I'll pay ya 
<br />
taxes, OR help me set up my own list man!
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So to people that said thank you, I say &quot;I appreciate it, and you're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; welcome&quot;, and I'm sorry to see you go.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And to those freeloading scum, I say, &quot;I wish you had shown your true colors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before so I could have kicked your ungrateful ass off.&quot;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Note I have unsubscribed hk512_at_cleveland.freenet.edu since I don't feel like
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reading any other posts by him.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And I'd like to thank Erich, who was the real list admin. I owned the list,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I asked him to run it, which he did. His job was to be the person behind
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; owner-sonic_at_lists.mv.net that people could ask questions to. Also he had the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dredded task of unsubscribing invalid email addresses.
</em><br />

<br />
So What do you say?  Help me out...?  Rat?  (That sounds so 
<br />
impersonal)
<br />

<br />
I'm really trying to be nice and good to all, honest. 
<br />
