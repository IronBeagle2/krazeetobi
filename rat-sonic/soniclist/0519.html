&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog Story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 4
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally had, from her earliest days, been groomed as the
<br />
successor to the throne of Mobius by her father.  In her had been
<br />
cultivated the arts and virtues of leadership.  It was now that
<br />
they would be put to the test.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandy, she can't stay here.  Whatever's wrong with her, she
<br />
may have a chance if we can get her to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But she can't endure hard travel, and that's what faces us
<br />
in crossing the Great Plain.  We'd need about five days to get to
<br />
Knothole on foot.&quot;  As Sandy spoke these last words, she gave
<br />
Sally a look that told her what she was afraid to ask: Sandy
<br />
didn't think that their mother had five days left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you've got to get back to Knothole.  Tell Dulcy to
<br />
get here as fast as she can.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You sure about this, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, there's no other way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait; who's Dulcy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll tell you later, Sandy.  Then you've got to get a
<br />
message to Uncle Chuck; have him come to Knothole at once.  He's
<br />
the only one who has the kind of knowledge we need.  We'll also
<br />
need a place for her to stay; we can use my hut.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog's usual bravado was gone; the situation was
<br />
way too serious.  With a simple &quot;Hang in there, Sal,&quot; he was on
<br />
his way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only after Sonic had left on his errands did Sally cross to
<br />
the shadowy figure and kneel beside her.  Sandy did the same and
<br />
touched the figure on the shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother,&quot; Sandy said softly, &quot;Mother, she's here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure slowly turned her head toward them.  The face was
<br />
sunken, pale and etched with pain.  Whatever disease she was
<br />
fighting against had already exacted a terrible price, and would
<br />
soon demand payment in full.  Yet Sally could plainly see her own
<br />
face in that of the one lying before her.  And even now, so close
<br />
to death, Sally could see a hint of what had once been great
<br />
beauty in the face of the sufferer.  Sally had never thought of
<br />
herself as beautiful--even if she were to admit it, it wouldn't
<br />
have been seemly to do so--but she could see it in this person,
<br />
whoever she was.  The possibility that this frail sufferer could
<br />
indeed be her mother was now impossible to ignore.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure slowly opened her eyes and looked at Sally.  It
<br />
seemed that it took her a while to focus her gaze.  Then, she
<br />
slowly reached up and caressed Sally's cheek.  Tears began to
<br />
well up in her eyes, and the corners of the parched mouth turned
<br />
upward.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally...my lost child...&quot; was all she could manage in a
<br />
congested whisper of a voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally started to call her &quot;Mother,&quot; choked on the word, then
<br />
collapsed on the figure's metallic breast, pouring out the sorrow
<br />
she had carried for so many years.  It was some minutes before
<br />
Sally could pull herself together enough to speak: &quot;I never knew
<br />
what happened to you.  I thought...I didn't know WHAT to think!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We were supposed to have been killed,&quot; Sandy said, her
<br />
voice full of controlled rage, &quot;and we would have been if
<br />
Robotnik had had his way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what happened to you?  And how did you ever find me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll leave the first question for now--it's too long a
<br />
story.  As for finding you, we almost didn't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was about three months ago that the Nomads we were
<br />
travelling with brought in a stranger: someone from the East who
<br />
seemed too eager to purchase weapons that the Nomads had their
<br />
eye on.  I overheard the conversation between the Nomad chiefs
<br />
and this stranger who called himself 'Dirk.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know a Dirk!  He's the leader of the Eastern band of
<br />
freedom fighters.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what he admitted, after some questioning and after
<br />
swearing the Nomad elders to secrecy.  Even then I don't think I
<br />
would have been interested until he spoke of a 'Princess Sally'
<br />
who was leading another group of fighters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother had spoken of you often, so I knew the name.  She
<br />
told me how we had been separated after we had been born, and how
<br />
she and I had to leave Mobotropolis.  On a chance, I cornered
<br />
Dirk after he'd left the elders.  I kept my veil in place so he
<br />
couldn't have known why I was so interested in this 'Princess
<br />
Sally.'  I could only learn from him that you lived in the Great
<br />
Forest, in some hidden place called Knothole.  Then I let him go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At that time, Mother's health was beginning to seriously
<br />
deteriorate.  When I told her what I had learned from Dirk, it
<br />
was as if she'd been given a new life.  She had to see if you
<br />
were still alive, so we abandoned the Nomads and began travelling
<br />
to the Great Forest.  We stopped frequently and made as good time
<br />
as possible.  Finally, Mother became so weak that I feared to
<br />
take her any further; that's when we arrived here.  I vowed I'd
<br />
find you and bring you to Mother.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I arrived at the Great Forest not knowing where to begin,
<br />
and then I spied your watchtower.  I thought I'd hide myself
<br />
until someone showed up, then I'd follow them back to Knothole. 
<br />
The first one to show up...well, I was surprised to find someone
<br />
else who was....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In answer, Sandy rose and tossed aside her cloak.  Her right
<br />
arm, from her shoulder to her fingertips, had been roboticized. 
<br />
&quot;Robotnik did this to me when I was four years old.  I'll always
<br />
remember the look on his face when he did it--the joy he took
<br />
from reducing a living being to some kind of machine.  You saw
<br />
what he did to Mother--he changed her piece by piece.  It was
<br />
painful, and it took months.  He called it 'science;' I call it
<br />
torture!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was stunned, not so much by Sandy's roboticized arm as
<br />
by the hatred with which she spoke.  &quot;You...you must have seen
<br />
Bunnie,&quot; she managed to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess that was her name.  Anyway, I also saw one of
<br />
Robotnik's crafts pull up next to her on the platform.  I didn't
<br />
hear the craft until it was too late; he must be using some kind
<br />
of silencer on the engine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind that; what happened?  Bunnie tells me you
<br />
started fighting the SWAT-bots single-handed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The only worthwhile things I learned from my years with the
<br />
Nomads were their ancient fighting techniques.  That's one of the
<br />
reasons Robotnik has managed to leave the Nomads alone all these
<br />
years, and how we've stayed hidden from them.  I made short work
<br />
of the bots--it's easy if you know how,&quot; she added as an aside. 
<br />
&quot;Then I waited for Bunnie to come to, for she'd fallen and was
<br />
unconscious.  When she called me by your name, I knew I had found
<br />
you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sally!  You in here?&quot; someone called out from the
<br />
corridor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In here, Dulcy!&quot; Sally answered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You never did say who this Dulcy is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's our ticket back to Knothole, and...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hi!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy turned and found herself looking into the face of a
<br />
dragon.  An adolescent dragon, to be sure, but it was still
<br />
something she hadn't counted on seeing.  Sandy immediately drew a
<br />
curved Nomad knife from its sheath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, hold it!&quot; Dulcy protested.  &quot;I'm on your side!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandy, this is Dulcy.  She's going to fly us back to
<br />
Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You've made friends with a dragon?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pleased to meet ya!&quot; Dulcy said as she extended a claw. 
<br />
Sandy replaced the knife, turned and walked back to where Queen
<br />
Alicia lay.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that your Ma?&quot; Dulcy asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, and that's my twin sister, Sandy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, wow, I didn't know you had a twin sister!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Neither did I, until tonight.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, yeah.  Well, we better get going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sandy carefully bundled up their mother, then
<br />
placed her inside the pouch on Dulcy's abdomen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're going to be OK, ma'am,&quot; Dulcy said as she was tucked
<br />
in, then she spoke to the girls: &quot;You two can saddle up once we
<br />
get outside, the ceilings are too low in here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving the fire to die out on its own, they made their way
<br />
out onto one of the open ledges that served as nesting sites. 
<br />
Sally had only just shown Sandy how to sit in the two-seated
<br />
saddle on Dulcy's back when the dragon stepped off of the ledge
<br />
and began falling.  Before anyone could say anything, Dulcy had
<br />
spread her wings and caught an updraft from the canyon.  A few
<br />
seconds later Dragonsnest was just a fading blur on the horizon
<br />
behind them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sandy!&quot; Dulcy called back.  &quot;You're doing pretty good!
<br />
You ever ridden a dragon before?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've never even SEEN a dragon before!&quot;  It was obvious from
<br />
her tone that she'd rather be doing anything else at the moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look!&quot; Sally called out.  &quot;That's the edge of the Great
<br />
Forest up ahead!  We'll be in Knothole before long.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, this wasn't the part of the journey that Sally was
<br />
looking forward to, for she knew what Sandy and her mother didn't
<br />
know: that Dulcy's landings needed a lot of work.  That was the
<br />
strongest argument against using Dulcy to carry the Queen to
<br />
Knothole, but the alternatives weren't any better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they were skimming over the trees.  After several
<br />
minutes, Sally pointed out some lights fluttering through the
<br />
foliage below, then a fire-lit clearing where Dulcy would land. 
<br />
Sally braced herself for one of Dulcy's usual clumsy landings. 
<br />
She began reproaching herself for the plan but stopped when Dulcy
<br />
said: &quot;We're here!&quot;  Sally hadn't felt a thing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sliding off of the saddle on Dulcy's back, Sally and Sandy
<br />
lifted their mother from Dulcy's pouch and placed her onto a
<br />
makeshift stretcher.  Bunnie and Rotor then bore the stretcher to
<br />
Sally's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy,&quot; Sally said as she turned back to speak with the
<br />
dragon, &quot;that landing was....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, I just hope your Ma's gonna be OK.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; she said quietly, then ran to catch up with the
<br />
others.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Sally's hut, lights were lit, the bed had been turned
<br />
down, and water was heating in a nearby fireplace.  The stretcher
<br />
was placed near the bed and Sally and Sandy began putting their
<br />
mother into the bed.  Bunnie and Rotor helped, but Bunnie's
<br />
attention was mainly on Sandy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh mah stars, you ARE twins!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandy,&quot; Sally began, &quot;this is....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We met,&quot; both Sandy and Bunnie managed to say in unison.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, could you tell everyone to keep their distance until
<br />
the Queen...until Mother has had a chance to rest?  I don't think
<br />
a lot of people crowding around will do her any good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure, Sally.  And maybe I'd better tell....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor was interrupted by the crashing sound of crockery
<br />
hitting the floor.  All eyes turned to the doorway.  There stood
<br />
Rosie, Sally's old nanny.  She looked at Queen Alicia with wide
<br />
eyes, then those eyes rolled upward and she went into a dead
<br />
faint.  Sally and Bunnie helped her up off the floor and seated
<br />
her in a nearby chair.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She looked like she'd seen a ghost!&quot; Bunnie said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She probably thought she did,&quot; Sandy added.  &quot;Mother once
<br />
told me that only a handful of people in the palace knew that
<br />
twins had been born, and they'd all been sworn to secrecy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, the secret was safe with Rosie. She never said
<br />
anything about my having a twin sister.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, from outside the hut there was a sound like the
<br />
sound barrier being seriously tested.  A moment later, Sonic
<br />
entered the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone followed him inside, someone whose body shone with a
<br />
metallic gleam in the hut's candlelight.  This was Sonic's uncle,
<br />
Sir Charles Hedgehog, once one of the leading scientific minds of
<br />
Mobius.  He was also one of the first to have been roboticized,
<br />
and it was only by a perseverance that managed to awaken some
<br />
spark of his old self that Sonic had been able to free his Uncle
<br />
Chuck's mind from Robotnik's control.  Now Uncle Chuck, as
<br />
everyone in Knothole called him, used his roboticized form to his
<br />
advantage and lived the life of a spy in Robotropolis, keeping
<br />
the Knothole freedom fighters informed of developments.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sandy had no knowledge of these things yet.  At the
<br />
first sight of Uncle Chuck, she immediately reached for her
<br />
knife.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot; Sally said, &quot;he's on our side.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;First a dragon, now a robot.  You've made quite an
<br />
interesting assortment of friends!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Uncle Chuck, he stood in the doorway transfixed as he
<br />
recognized the figure in Sally's bed.  Then, without a word, he
<br />
crossed over to the side of the bed and dropped to one knee,
<br />
bowing his head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am at your service, my Queen,&quot; he said softly.  He raised
<br />
his head and looked into her face.  &quot;I...I never thought I'd see
<br />
this day!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My days...may be few,&quot; the Queen managed to whisper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't talk like that, Mother!&quot; Sally said.  &quot;Uncle Chuck is
<br />
going to do everything he can to help.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And the most helpful thing we can do is to let the Queen
<br />
rest,&quot; Uncle Chuck added.  &quot;Everyone except the princesses, go
<br />
back to bed; I want to talk to them.  And to Rosie, once she
<br />
wakes up.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The residents of Knothole were up and about even earlier
<br />
than usual the next morning.  Mostly, though, they were clustered
<br />
near Sally's hut discussing the events of the night just ended. 
<br />
In obedience to Uncle Chuck's order, the freedom fighters stayed
<br />
outside the hut.  However, as a spontaneous gesture, they began
<br />
leaving flowers, fruit, personal items and other objects near the
<br />
door and on the porch.  It was clear that their loyalty to the
<br />
Queen had not dimmed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside, Uncle Chuck had spoken with Sandy, trying to learn
<br />
all she knew about how she and her mother had come to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  He studied both the Queen and Sandy for
<br />
some time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is an older design,&quot; he told Sally and Sandy, &quot;not
<br />
like the one Robotnik is using now.  He must have used a
<br />
prototype of the roboticizer on you and your mother, Sandy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somehow,&quot; Sandy added bitterly, &quot;I don't appreciate the
<br />
fact that we were test subjects.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As for Rosie, she almost went into hysterics when she came
<br />
to.  Uncle Chuck was able to calm her, so that she could tell her
<br />
own story:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've not seen the two princesses together since I helped
<br />
bring them both into the world.  And no sooner had I done so that
<br />
this official-looking swine in a uniform walks into the room. 
<br />
There were two police robots with him, there were, and what he
<br />
says were orders from the King.  He says the Queen and the
<br />
second-born daughter were to be moved that night to the capitol
<br />
of the Southern Provinces, while the first-born was to stay with
<br />
the King in Mobotropolis.  'Security concerns,' he says!  I
<br />
didn't believe him for a second, but the King said to let them
<br />
go.  Then he swears me to secrecy not to say that two babies were
<br />
born that night.  I didn't understand why, but I obeyed my King,
<br />
I did!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And that's why you fainted when you saw Mother and Sandy?&quot;
<br />
Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I...well, it was the last I'd heard of them until we
<br />
received reports that the Southern capitol had been bombed in the
<br />
Great War.  The reports all spoke of there being no survivors
<br />
so....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you thought we'd been killed,&quot; Sandy said.  &quot;And we
<br />
almost were, too.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If only it hadn't been for that war....&quot; Sally added.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've got news for you, Sally.  The Great War ended two
<br />
years after we were born.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knothole dwellers looked at Sandy, stunned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother and I weren't able to learn that until later, when
<br />
we'd talk with other refugees we met on the caravans: the other
<br />
side had sued for peace repeatedly.  Those reports were never
<br />
carried back to Mobotropolis, which continued sending military
<br />
bots to the staging area in the south.  From there, they were
<br />
being dispatched to conquer neutral territories all over Mobius. 
<br />
Only when they were all under martial law and under the control
<br />
of the bots did War Minister Julian move against
<br />
Mobotropolis....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...calling himself Ivo Robotnik,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;I can see
<br />
it all now; why couldn't we have seen it coming?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Uncle Chuck said softly, &quot;never mind the past. 
<br />
We've got work to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a diagnostic program resident in Nicole, he was able
<br />
to take readings on Queen Alicia's roboticized parts as well as
<br />
her internal organs and systems.  He also had Rosie gather
<br />
together a great number of bowls to be sterilized by placing them
<br />
in boiling water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to need blood samples.  I'm also going to need
<br />
paper.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncle Chuck examined a number of Sally's books, found
<br />
several with suitable paper, then enlisted Tails to carefully cut
<br />
along the margins with a pair of scissors to make paper strips.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it was time to take blood samples.  Sonic, Sally, Rotor
<br />
and Bunnie were more than willing to help, even though it meant
<br />
nothing so taxing as each of them placing about a dozen drops of
<br />
their blood in a bowl.  Antoine was more reluctant, but his
<br />
initial reluctance melted as he saw the first few drops of
<br />
Bunnie's sample dripping into a bowl, and he promptly fainted. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck found it much easier to get the sample from the
<br />
unconscious fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is a good look for Ant,&quot; was Sonic's observation. 
<br />
Finally, the samples were ready and labelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't suppose you have any of the Queen's medical records
<br />
on file,&quot; Uncle Chuck asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know.  Nicole has access to the royal archives but
<br />
there's some kind of a security block on them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Level 7?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you know!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry about it, Sally.  I'm going to need some of
<br />
that paper now, Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cutting a small strip from the paper, Uncle Chuck dipped one
<br />
end of it into the sample of Sally's blood.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole,&quot; Uncle Chuck ordered, &quot;access royal archives.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;ROYAL ARCHIVES ONLINE.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, is there a small opening near the top of Nicole's
<br />
casing?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes; I've wondered what that was.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I'm right, it's a biosample access port.  Would you open
<br />
it, please?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally did so, and Uncle Chuck slid the bloodied paper strip
<br />
into it.  A few seconds later:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GENETIC PATTERN CONFIRMED.  LEVEL 7 SECURITY BLOCK HAS BEEN
<br />
REMOVED.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So THAT'S why I could never get anywhere trying to crack a
<br />
level 7 block!&quot; Rotor said.  &quot;It's not based on alphanumerics at
<br />
all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's right, Rotor.  A level 7 is based on genetic
<br />
sequence pattern recognition.  I didn't know whose pattern was
<br />
used, the King's or the Queen's, but I guessed that Sally's
<br />
blood would have enough of either of her parents to match.  Now,
<br />
I've got tests to run.  Sally, may I have use of Nicole?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course, Uncle Chuck.  Sandy and I have...business...to
<br />
take care of.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
<br />
