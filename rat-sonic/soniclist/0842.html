Part 3.
<br />

<br />
One week later.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse lay on his bed, thinking about what had occured during the days 
<br />
since Sally had told him he was accepted as a Freedom Fighter.  He had been 
<br />
told many things.  He had seen how the Freedom Fighters and the rest of the 
<br />
villagers lived and worked.  And, he was finding a place for himself...
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...A Freedom Fighter leaves no detail unnoticed...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Sonic and Tolouse walked through the forest.  &quot;Remember, Tolouse, use 
<br />
your eyes, ears, nose, everything.  But don't start using one so much that you 
<br />
ignore all the others.  You're gonna hafta rely on all of them all the time...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Found her!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic ran up beside him.  &quot;Good work, Tolouse!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally got up from her hiding place.  &quot;Yes, good work.  Tell me, Tolouse, 
<br />
how did you find me?  I was completely hidden from view.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw where you had stepped on leaves, and then when I was close, I 
<br />
noticed your scent.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic said, &quot;There, you see?  You hafta use all the senses all the time.  
<br />
You did great!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse smiled, proud...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...A Freedom Fighter does not ignore any possible sign of danger...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Tails jumped.  &quot;Ah!  What is that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had suggested that Tolouse and Tails spend some time getting to know 
<br />
each other.  What Tolouse didn't know was that Sonic and Tails also had a plan 
<br />
of their own, and this was another test for Tolouse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked in the direction that the noise was coming from, and was a 
<br />
little scared himself.  He thought that perhaps it was just a forest animal, 
<br />
but his life had taught him never to be too sure of anything.  In his old 
<br />
village, everybody would have been underground by now.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at Tails, and tried to sound confident.  &quot;Uh...wait here Tails.  
<br />
I'll check it out...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse began to cautiously approach the area of the noise...but then he 
<br />
stopped himself...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...A Freedom Fighter never puts anybody at unnecessary risk...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Wrong answer, Tolouse, he thought to himself.  Looking at Tails again, 
<br />
he said, &quot;Come on.  It's probably nothing, but I don't really know.  We'll go 
<br />
back and tell the others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a blue streak broke out of the forest from where the noise had 
<br />
occured, and stopped right in front of Tolouse and Tails.  The streak formed 
<br />
itself into Sonic, who stood there smirking.  Tolouse jumped in surprise, and 
<br />
Tails giggled.  &quot;Right answer, Tolouse,&quot; Sonic said.  &quot;You win again!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So that was...aww, I should've known!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails piped up, &quot;But you didn't know, Tolouse.  You can't take chances 
<br />
when you are with somebody else.  Right, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic gave Tails a high-five.  &quot;Right, big guy!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Advice that you should follow yourself, Sonic Hedgehog.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three turned around to see Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aww, Sal, I never take any chances.  I always know what I'm doing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rolled her eyes, and said, chuckling, &quot;Of course you do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails giggled.  Sonic shrugged and said, &quot;Come on, big guy, race you 
<br />
home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, Sonic,&quot; and they were off in a blur of legs and tails, while Sally 
<br />
and Tolouse decided not to try and keep up as they walked back to the 
<br />
village...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Most importantly, a Freedom Fighter stays calm in the face of danger...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Tolouse and Sonic sat in the look-out post the Freedom Fighters had 
<br />
constructed near the southern edge of the Great Forest.  Sonic handed a pair of 
<br />
binoculars to Tolouse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You see that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked through the binoculars at the horizon.  Through them, the 
<br />
city came into detail, and he shivered.  &quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotropolis, where Ro-butt-nik lives.  Pretty scary just to look at, 
<br />
isn't it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, it is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you can't stay scared, bud.  Some day you are going to be with us 
<br />
on a mission there, and you're gonna hafta make yourself stay unscared.  
<br />
Understand?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked at the horizon, the city a small dot once again to his un-
<br />
aided eyes.  &quot;Yes, I understand.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  Now, how do you like it up here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What, up here in the tree?  It's okay, I guess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Glad you like it!  That's your first mission:  you have sentry duty 
<br />
tonight.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic chuckled.  &quot;Like Sally would say, I'm just full of surprises.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse look bewildered.  &quot;Uh, tonight?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic laughed.  &quot;Don't worry, all you gotta do is stay up and watch.  If 
<br />
you see anything bad looking, just use this box to call Sally.&quot;  Sonic handed 
<br />
Tolouse a com-link.  &quot;Think you'll be okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I guess.  Just wish I had known a little ahead of time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic laughed again.  &quot;I told you you were in for an adventure.  And 
<br />
adventures don't keep schedules.&quot;  As he started to climb down, he said.  &quot;Oh, 
<br />
Tolouse, I'll be back to check up on ya.  Don't fall asleep!&quot;...
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A knock sounded on Tolouse's door.  When Tolouse opened it, he saw Sonic 
<br />
standing there.  &quot;Hi, Sonic.  What's up?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked him in the eye and said, &quot;We have a mission, bud.&quot;
<br />

<br />
