<br />
This is to all concerned -
<br />

<br />
SEGA has a very strong vested interest in the little blue critter. The
<br />
problem is maintaining fan support among the GAMING SYSTEMS, from what I can
<br />
tell. Let's put it this way. There was Atari, then the Commodore, then the
<br />
Amiga, then finally Nintendo unleashed the Super Mario Bros. and became a
<br />
monster. SEGA struck back with SONIC on the GENESIS SYSTEM and defeated
<br />
Mario. They countered with GAME GEAR which was superior to Game Boy. They
<br />
came out with the CD SYSTEM while  Nintendo was reeling with the Super NES.
<br />
But then came the 3DO and SONY PLAYSTATION and other CD format systems,
<br />
creating confusion in the market place. Instead of getting the SATURN out to
<br />
counter these other systems, SEGA made a Nintendo-like mistake by coming out
<br />
with the 32-X. 
<br />

<br />
Right now, there's a shake-up going on in the marketplace. Only so much
<br />
product can receive public support before the public says enough and clamors
<br />
for sanity. The public right now wants to feel they aren't buying a system
<br />
that'll be out of date by next year. So far, the best compromise seems to be
<br />
buying games you can play on your PC, instead of messingaround trying to
<br />
figure out which is the best system to get.
<br />

<br />
People like me are frustrated because while I like SEGA gaming systems and
<br />
SONIC THE HEDGEHOG games as well as a variety of others, right now games are
<br />
going exclusively with certain systems instead of being available for every
<br />
platform like they used to be. For instance, I'm looking forward to playing
<br />
the new GOLDENEYE game, but it's ONLY going to be made available for the
<br />
latest Nintendo system. And you're going to see more and more of this sort of
<br />
thing as companies fight for a bigger piece of the market share.
<br />

<br />
SEGA will support SONIC because of his acceptance in the marketplace. They
<br />
just may tend to downplay him because they may feel he only attracts a
<br />
certain segment of the market, and they want to reach a broader audience.
<br />
Only if the fan base makes its support of SONIC known to SEGA will the
<br />
corporate suits be able to determine the breadth and depth of that support.
<br />

<br />
SONIC isn't dead. Not by a long shot.
<br />

<br />
