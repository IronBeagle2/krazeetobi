<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ive just read mightys mail about fanfic.....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And must say i disagree with him on it.  It is good to have diffrent 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ideas of how mobius might progress, each a parrallel universe to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;another.  This allows everyone to have a vision of what they think 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;happens, and allows us, to read each story for its own worth, and to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;consider it on its own merits.  
</em><br />

<br />
I'm glad people dissagree with me so easily.  It seems like a bombardment
<br />
for a simple letter stating something, but I'll get to that.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I mean the BAM storyline, i realy like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it, but some of what happens contradicts other storys... So what, its 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;still a good story, i like to feel that it is set in a parrallel to the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;other story, thus the problem of contridictions is solved.
</em><br />

<br />
I never said it wasn't.  The one problem with E-mail (besides it being used
<br />
to corrupt the people), is that you can't understand my tone when I make a
<br />
comment.  I personally LIKE BAM quite a lot!  Especially the deluxe
<br />
version-such dedication over something that COULD HAVE BEEN trivial is what
<br />
made it great.  Hats off to the author of BAM, (whom which I personally
<br />
spoke with,) for he is truly a fine storywriter!  As point of fact, (to
<br />
quote Levine), it is unwise to assume how I feel about a thing (ie the
<br />
story) when I only commented about the Sonic writing process as a whole.
<br />
Please try to refrain from such in the future! :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Also about the robotisizer,  also a good idea in my point of view...BUT 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remeber Robotniks Forces have main robotisizers, these i have been lead 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to belive can do many at once, where as the FF only have a one at a time 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;BLUE robotisizer, this means that they now have a weapon to use agenst 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;robotnik, but robotnik still has an edge so to speak. For every one the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;FF derobotisise, Robuttnik can do many, possible hundreds.
</em><br />

<br />
This is very correct.  In such, (hypothetically speaking,) we are fighting a
<br />
futile war. The only thing that keeps it going is our ambition (as freedom
<br />
fighters,) which perhaps will not last.  I say this for two reasons,
<br />
(bringing up new points,) first off, Robotnik may inevidably win.  SECONDLY,
<br />
and most importantly, what will be of the next generation?  I see singles,
<br />
(at most doubles), of different species.  Are they going to interbreed?  As
<br />
point in fact, how would a half-squirrel half-hedgehog look for a kid?
<br />
(Sally and Sonic in contrast, of course..) it, would most likely, not work. =
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />

<br />

<br />
....and more generally, (do not flame me for this-this is on-topic in my
<br />
oppinion,)
<br />

<br />
What is it to become &quot;obsessed&quot; with what once a video game?  I'm not
<br />
blaming anyone-I am myself.  And I'm not inviting flames, such as, &quot;well, if
<br />
you don't like it, leave!&quot;...I'm asking, rather simply....my friends suspect
<br />
me as being &quot;messed-up&quot; for such obsession, (which I probably am...) but I
<br />
have been into Sonic when Sonic the Hedgehog was released on the old
<br />
system....I'm what you'd call a &quot;classic fan&quot;... we all are... (I would
<br />
think..) what what makes us this?  What obsession?  I don't want it to lead
<br />
somewhere bad, and as much as I hate conformity, do any of you think this
<br />
obsession with a make-beleive world is normal?  Please answer in a truthful
<br />
and non-sarcastic tone.  If you have to flame me, don't.  It will waste
<br />
&quot;precious bandwith&quot; (I love that line) and will make me sad.
