Spoiler form feed:
<br />

<br />
I hate to be such a naysayer, but here goes:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The cover didn't work for me in two areas: Sally seemed a bit paunchy, 
<br />
and I couldn't tell if Sonic was supposed to be flying (how?) or hanging 
<br />
onto something (how, again, with both arms full?).
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Story by Angelo Decesare, art by Brian Thomas.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The art was OK, though Rotor on page 10 was out of perspective -
<br />
he looked more like Butch Kowalski from Littlest Pet Shop :^)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The story was OK, though I was expecting a continuation of last issue's 
<br />
King Acorn saga...  The usual nitpicks follow:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I don't think I buy the bit about Uncle Chuck staying a robot - if he 
<br />
(and presumably Muttski) are the only ones left, how will he still spy
<br />
on Robotnik?  (Assuming the deroboticization was permanent...)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
How convenient/lucky Sally gets clobbered like that and only ends up with 
<br />
a sprained arm and bruised head - anybody else would've had a broken spine 
<br />
or worse, but hey, this is a comic book :^)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Robotnik lamenting his &quot;beautiful city&quot; after being wrecked by the quake?
<br />
Seems to me he gloried in pollution and destruction - wouldn't a quake 
<br />
just hasten the process?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The ending seemed a bit abrupt - not even a &quot;to be continued&quot;, but the 
<br />
letter column indicates it will be...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Now for the Bunnie story:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Again, I hate to be negative, but I'll sum it up with one word: Dallas.
<br />
If that didn't work, here's another one: take the title literally.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
About all I can say is &quot;now that we got _that_ over with, can we get onto 
<br />
some _other_ Bunnie stories?  Or is that all you can do with her?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
The artwork by Rich Koslowski was great, but I'll let other drooling 
<br />
fanboys comment about the clear indication that she's all robot from the 
<br />
waist down, even her tail :^(  FWIW, I just checked the title credits on 
<br />
the show, as well as &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot;, and they both show she's organic 
<br />
from the waist up.  Also FWIW, I notice the title sequence and first 
<br />
episode gave Sally solid-blue eyes, yet the second season gave her blue eyes
<br />
and black pupils (with a white dot); I prefer the latter, but I digress...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
After I just now checked Bunnie's de- and re-roboticization in Sonic 
<br />
Conversion, I'm afraid this story didn't have quite the same emotional 
<br />
impact, but that's probably being unfair, comparing animated sound cartoon 
<br />
with a voiceless, unmoving comic book.  Still, that shot of Bunnie on page 3
<br />
and her tearful departure on page 7 weren't anything to sneeze at.  However,
<br />
I'm still disappointed at the ending - I think I would have preferred some 
<br />
technobabble solution over the one that was offered.  Oh well, I suppose 
<br />
any Bunnie story is better than none at all :^)
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I didn't recognize any names in the &quot;find your name in print page&quot; - does
<br />
anybody from the list write to the comic itself?  And whatever happened 
<br />
to that &quot;notes from the net&quot; idea?
<br />
