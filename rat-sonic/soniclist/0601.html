<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay Packbell,&quot; said Williams, &quot;you can take me to Robotnik now.
<br />
Computer, unscramble the Swat-bot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swat-bot on the floor, where Tails had left him, got up and returned
<br />
to normal as if nothing happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can you undo a random process?&quot; Packbell wanted to know.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Only an idiot does something he can't undo,&quot; was all Williams said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Swat-bots you disabled earlier, you have all the data that was lost?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course.  When we get to Robotropolis, I won't mention anything about
<br />
Tails or being taken against your will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell was extremely confused.  If Williams didn't want to be a
<br />
prisoner, why was he giving in?  He certainly had the ability to escape.  All
<br />
he had to do was tell his computer--  His computer!  That was the key!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give me your computer,&quot; ordered Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give me that computer of yours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams laughed out loud.  &quot;I'm not your prisoner!&quot; he managed to say,
<br />
still laughing.  &quot;I'm just visiting Robotnik to help him out and what not.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell utilized all available data and still could not find any reason
<br />
for this kind of behavior.  In his experience, nobody ever wanted to help
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you are a freedom fighter,&quot; said Packbell, &quot;why do you not resist?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just disabled a Swat-bot and threatened to do the same to you.  You
<br />
don't call that resistance?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That is what I mean.  Why do you help a freedom fighter, then turn around
<br />
and help Robotnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess there are just some things you will never understand.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the trip was spent in silence.  When they arrived at
<br />
Robotropolis, Williams was escorted to Robotnik's lair.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Commander Packbell,&quot; greeted Robotnik, &quot;I see you've brought me my
<br />
prisoner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am in no way here against my will,&quot; stated Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik looked at Packbell as if this was all just a joke.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is true.  He can leave at any time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why can't you stop him?&quot;  Robotnik seemed worried.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I came here to help you out,&quot; said Williams, &quot;and you treat me like one
<br />
of your prisoners.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell, seize him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell took one look at Williams and remembered what had happened to the
<br />
Swat-bot.  &quot;No,&quot; he disobeyed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll seize him myself.&quot;  Robotnik started to approach Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's robotic arm suddenly grabbed his neck and started to strangle
<br />
him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What...is...going...on...&quot; he somehow managed to force air out of his
<br />
lungs even though his throat was being crushed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, stop.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hand let go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I knew you were going to try something.  You're a bit behind in this
<br />
conversation.  Packbell and I are on 'I'm here to help you.'  You're way back
<br />
at 'seize him.'  If you want my help, I suggest you cooperate.  If not,
<br />
Packbell and I will go back to Knothole and rule the world from there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell?&quot;  Robotnik directed his attention to the android.  &quot;You were at
<br />
Knothole?  And you didn't tell me!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; he stood behind Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whose side are you on!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell didn't dare say what was on his mind.  &quot;If only our positions
<br />
were reversed,&quot; he was thinking.  &quot;This person has complete control over me,
<br />
what am I to do about it!?!&quot;  He told Robotnik what he wanted to hear,
<br />
&quot;Yours, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then take him prisoner!  Now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, that's it!&quot;  Williams was fed up.  &quot;I'll be leaving now.  Don't
<br />
expect me to help you.&quot;  He turned around and was about leave when Sonic came
<br />
rushing in with four Swat-bots behind him.  &quot;You have to show up at the worst
<br />
possible times, don't you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Grab on!  We're gettin' outta here!&quot; ordered Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell took the initiative and tried to grab Sonic, but was too slow.
<br />
Sonic had already grabbed Williams and was headed for the door when he was
<br />
cut off by the pursuing Swat-bots.  He stopped, turned around and took off in
<br />
the opposite direction.  The next thing he knew, he was face up on the
<br />
ground.  Williams had held on to his backpack so when he took off his feet
<br />
went forward and the rest of him stayed.  Packbell reached down and picked
<br />
Sonic up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  Put me down!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've always wanted to know what you keep in here...&quot;  Williams opened up
<br />
Sonic's backpack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What're you doin'!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He rummaged through the pack.  &quot;A power ring...  Infra-red goggles?...&quot; he
<br />
put them on.  &quot;Hee, hee!  Very cool.&quot;  He didn't have a neat backpack like
<br />
Sonic, so he wore the goggles over his forehead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...&quot; started Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams,&quot; continued Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Williams.  I see I've underestimated you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;People tend to do that.  Want a ring?&quot;  He tossed the power ring to
<br />
Robotnik like a frisbee.  &quot;Now what?  We roboticize him?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!?!&quot; complained Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean 'what?'  You trust me, don't you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not any more, bud.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned.  He turned to Robotnik, &quot;You trust me, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He groaned again.  &quot;Trapped in the middle,&quot; he said to himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the way to the roboticizer, Sonic said some things to the effect of
<br />
&quot;you'll never get away with this&quot; and &quot;you can roboticize me, but there will
<br />
be others.&quot;  In the end, they were all in front of that small, diamond-glass
<br />
tube.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was being lead inside by Packbell when Robotnik interrupted him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No.  Put the armadillo in first.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am NOT an armadillo!&quot; corrected Williams as he was being lead inside by
<br />
two Swat-bots.  &quot;See this tail?  Do armadillos have prehensile tails?&quot;  He
<br />
was now enclosed in the tube.  &quot;I'm giving you one last chance before I
<br />
retaliate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik walked over to the control panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, throw the roboticizer boot-up program into an infinite loop.&quot;
<br />
His computer inserted the necessary code.  &quot;And computer, retrieve the
<br />
location of Knothole from Packbell, then delete it from his memory.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik hit a button and the sound of the roboticizer warming up filled
<br />
the room.  But it kept warming, the beam never kicked in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd say we've thirty or so seconds before the entire room blows up,&quot;
<br />
approximated Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would get you for this,&quot; said Robotnik, &quot;but you saved me the trouble.
<br />
Packbell, lock the hedgehog in the room.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik and the Swat-bots left the room.  Packbell, still carrying Sonic,
<br />
stepped outside, threw Sonic back in, and closed the only door to the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Williams and, albeit he gave Robotnik the only power ring
<br />
Sonic had with him, he did save Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stand back!&quot; he said and tried to buzz-saw his way through the glass.
<br />
Not even a scratch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, raise the diamond-glass tube.&quot;  It retracted back into the
<br />
ceiling.  &quot;Computer, how much time until the roboticizer overheats?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Forty-two seconds,&quot; his computer reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We have more time than I thought.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's go!&quot; urged Sonic.  &quot;We're going to be toast!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax.  We have more than an ample amount of time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic tapped his foot on the ground as he waited.  Two seconds later,
<br />
&quot;Time's up, let's go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't you want to wait until the last second and escape just in time?
<br />
Maybe dive behind something just as it's exploding?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not leaving without you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  Computer, take the roboticizer out of the loop.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The roboticizer stopped warming up and engaged the beam.  Of course,
<br />
nobody was underneath it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You could've done that all along?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, huh,&quot; nodded Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's go.  Through this vent.&quot;  Sonic lead the way out of the building.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was in for a pleasant surprise.  &quot;Rain!  I love the rain!&quot;  He
<br />
started to walk away.  &quot;Bye!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic caught up with him.  &quot;Where are you going?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To the Great Swamp.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the rain!?!  I'll take you there.&quot;  He picked Williams up and they
<br />
were headed to the Great Swamp.  Williams gave directions as they went and
<br />
they soon arrived at a small village.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, you may go now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're going to stay here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes.  This is where I live.  Bye.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was hesitant, but said his good-bye and left.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, there were still clouds overhead, but it seemed to be
<br />
clearing up.  Life in Knothole was returning to normal, but many villagers
<br />
still talked about Williams.  Tails and Dulcy were playing air tag.  Sally
<br />
was in her hut &quot;recovering&quot; as a messenger bird perched on her window sill.
<br />
She took the note from it and it flew away.  On it was written:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To: Tails (No Pun Intended)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails!&quot; Sally called out the window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails flew down and entered her hut.  &quot;What is it, Aunt Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You have...mail.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool!&quot;  Tails had never gotten mail before.  He opened it up.  There was
<br />
a small disc tied to the bottom of the note.  It read:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Tails,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought you might like some information on the retrieval of data from
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other computers without direct links.  You wanted to know how I scrambled
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that Swat-bot, this will get you started.  Enclosed is a disc with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;everything on it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails untied the disc and asked Sally to borrow Nicole.  She let him, so
<br />
he inserted the disc and accessed what was on it.  A list of all the files
<br />
came up with a message at the bottom:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P.S.  You now have a virus.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now the character profile.
<br />

<br />
Name: Gabriel Williams
<br />
Species: Giant pangolin
<br />
Sex: Male
<br />
Age: 22
<br />
War Standing: Impartial observer
<br />
Occupation: Freelance hacker
<br />
Specialties: Computers and everything about them
<br />
Other Notes: Gabriel was originally born and raised in Mobitropolis, but was
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;relocated to a village near the great swamp when Robotnik took over.  He
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can make the best out of any situation and always stays calm, even when he
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has no idea what's going on.  A few of his friends have been known to call
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him Xero at times, supposedly because of his sense of humor.  He uses this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;name when he doesn't want anybody to know his real one.  He doesn't really
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;care who wins the war and has been trying not to get involved.  But since
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he's been dragged into the war, he'll fight for whichever side he wants
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and change sides a few times to make it interesting.  Gabriel has a
<br />
