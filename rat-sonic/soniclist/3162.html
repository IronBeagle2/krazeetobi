Ken:
<br />

<br />
Sorry that you only have to emerge from Lurkerland when there are these
<br />
kinds of discrepancies.  
<br />

<br />
My own interest in this matter, as you may have guessed, goes beyond
<br />
fandom.  I continue to maintain the FAQ File in part because of my
<br />
interest in theology.  Seriously, it's one thing to speculate on the
<br />
process of how the Old Testament, for instance, came to be canonized;
<br />
it's quite another thing to watch the process of canonization unfold in
<br />
the present.  THAT's how I consider the state of things in this corner
<br />
of Sonic fandom.  
<br />

<br />
And now, for a few particulars:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Just to settle the argument, Sally and Sonic were 13 at the commencement, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they're currently 15 right now. The story with Julayla was written just
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; before &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; aired, as we were working from a script because we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; needed to establish the character of Rosie. As I recall, the time-line wasn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; too established in the script we were working from, as the war was only going
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on for a couple of years. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
Has any other comic you've worked on become this complex?  Back home I
<br />
have (courtesy of a friend in New York State) a copy of the character
<br />
&quot;bible&quot; for the old Care Bears cartoon series.  it isn't just a single
<br />
sheet.  And over on a Disney animation group the similar bible for the
<br />
series &quot;Gargoyles&quot; has been described as huge!  Perhaps if Sega had
<br />
commissioned a similar bible these conflicts need never have happened.
<br />
But that's just 20/20 hindsight talking....
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We worked out our own timeline as a result, based on SEGA treating the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; characters as if they aged at the same rate we do. If we treated them in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; terms of how animals really age (so many of their years = one of ours), Sonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Sally would've been portrayed as battle-hardened adults by this time. As
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; further proof of this, when we portrayed Sonic and Sally married in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; future, there were a few comments about how old they should be to get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; married.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
The fans generally seem to agree with the idea of aging at a human rate,
<br />
as it were.  And &quot;battle-hardened&quot; is the last term I'd use to describe
<br />
the Knothole gang.  Tactically, they prefer harassment and hit-and-run
<br />
to all-out assaults.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; To go by the timeline that the war started when Sonic and Sally were five
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; didn't make sense, especially when you factor in their current age. As far as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we were concerned, this was one time when the show got it wrong. However,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; because it's TV, most people accept that version as gospel.
</em><br />

<br />
In Judaism, when there's a gap in the Biblical narrative that begs to be
<br />
explained, the process called &quot;midrash&quot; takes over.  Over in this group,
<br />
it's called &quot;fanfic.&quot;  I wrote &quot;Capture The Flag&quot; to answer a number of
<br />
questions that never got satisfactorily answered either in the comics or
<br />
on TV:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did Knothole come from?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the kids live there?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who else was there with them?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did they start their campaign against Robotnik?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did the power ring generator get there?
<br />

<br />
Those are just the ones I can remember off the top of my head.  The
<br />
point is, I didn't have the luxury of thinking &quot;the show got it wrong.&quot;
<br />
My task as a writer was: &quot;OK, using the information I have, including
<br />
the fact that Robotnik took over when the kids were 5 years old, how do
<br />
I answer these questions?&quot;  Where the fans have been having trouble has
<br />
not been in thinking &quot;the show got it wrong&quot; or Archie got it wrong; the
<br />
biggest debates, as you've no doubt seen, have come from open conflicts
<br />
of fact (15 v. 16 years old; ground squirrel v. fox, etc.).
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; My attitude is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that it's the games that establish the world of Sonic, with the series,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paperbacks and comics filling in the details, with neither one more valid
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than the other. Mike and I tried to be consistent with all versions, but for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; various reasons, couldn't always be.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mike and I constantly disagree over what happens in the world of Sonic, as we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; try our best to do the best stories we can. And our approach definitely
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; differs from the other writers involved in the series. That doesn't mean
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they're wrong or bad. They just have a different slant on the characters and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; series.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
Again, I don't think anyone is being overly critical of the comics,
<br />
though the degree of fan acceptance of the TV series is so strong that
<br />
when rumors of a Sonic movie were flying around here a couple weeks ago
<br />
I sensed a strong concensus that the character of Sonic wouldn't be
<br />
acceptable unless he were once more voiced by Jaleel White.  And IMHO
<br />
you and Mike Kanterovich are the strongest writers that Archie has
<br />
working on the series.  The burden of consistency, however, appears to
<br />
be resting on nobody's shoulders in particular.  Sega has given some
<br />
details about characters (Sonic's character guide is available on a
<br />
couple of fan home pages) but it's apparently broad enough to permit some
<br />
differences within and between media.  And (to bring it full circle)
<br />
that's why I continue to maintain the FAQ File -- to bring a certain
<br />
amount of order out of creative chaos.
<br />

<br />
Hey, I'm a librarian.  It's what I do.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; So go ahead, enjoy your take on the world of SONIC. Think of Sonic like some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of the other classic characters, and how many different versions of Batman
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and Superman there are. I guess you could chalk it all up to artistic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, if you ask a question to settle a debate, you're going to get my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; interpretation that I work out with the editors at Archie and the licensing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; department at SEGA, okay?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />

<br />
Maybe what we need to do is convene the cyberspace equivalent of the
<br />
Council of Jamnia (which fixed the Old Testament canon around AD 90).
<br />
There'd be representatives of Sega, Archie (I nominate you and Mike),
<br />
and Pat Allee and Ben Hurst would represent the TV series.  The fans
<br />
would draw up a list of questions and you and the others would huddle
<br />
until they were answered.  Right now, the only alternative is that we
<br />
the fans take matters into our own hands and write fanfic.
<br />

<br />
Bet they never have these kind of problems in Riverdale High!
<br />

<br />
And now for the mushy sig:
