<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Confused?  Think of it this way:  In the world of Dana Scully and Fox Muldar,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what TV show comes on the Fox network Fridays at 9PM?  Certainly not the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'X-Files'!  And do you think that Calvin and Hobbes are laughing at the

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; antics of a young boy and his imaginary pet tiger when they read the news-
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; paper funnies?
</em><br />

<br />
Ever seen &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot;?  In the &quot;How I Spent My Vacation&quot; 
<br />
episode, Plucky offers Hamton several suggestions on what to do over the 
<br />
summer break.  One is to spend the whole time parked in front of the TV.  
<br />
Then Plucky's eyes become a pair of TV's playing the Tiny Toons intro.
<br />

<br />
In another episode, Buster and Babs are thinking about auditioning for a 
<br />
new Warner Bros. cartoon.  But Babs reminds Buster they already do Tiny 
<br />
Toons, and she does a TTA intro sequence of her own.  All the toons know 
<br />
they are TTA stars.  And you'll find more scattered through the series.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now, it is possible to get both the 'real' world and the 'ficticious' world
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to exist simultaniously.  For example, in a series of stories that I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; currently writing, a genius doctor/biologist develops a fixation with the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comic book and cartoon series 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles', spends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; most his life trying to create the foursome himself, and eventually succeeds.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And so, in the world of this story, TMNT exists both in real life and in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now how is the Sonic story going to deal with these issues?
</em><br />

<br />
I don't want to give very much away, but this has already been reworked 
<br />
several times to get it right.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If you say that the Sonic world is real, and therefore does not exist in
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; fiction, then how did this mailing list come about?  There would no video
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; games and comic books to talk about.  Could it be that some of us heard about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; transmissions from deep space, possibly a whole other universe (detailing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fights between Robotnik and the Freedom Fighters), over on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alt.conspiracy.paranoia (or whatever its called) that the government is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; trying to deny exist, and so we put together a mailing list intending to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get to the bottom of these transmissions?
</em><br />

<br />
The list itself will be playing a rather minor role.  It's mostly for the 
<br />
initial setup.  The subscribers are the important element.  The list is, 
<br />
in part, what ties together people who are so far apart on this planet.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Now let's say that the comic books and video games do exist, and that this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mailing list was the result of them (all true so far).  So where does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the actual planet of Mobius fit into all this?  Going into the hypothetical
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; world of multiple universes here, I guess you could say that if there's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; an infinite number of universes, then SOMEWHERE there actually exists a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sonic the Hedgehog and an evil Dr. Robotnik, and all of the other things
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; given in the stories.  But what are the odds of hearing about this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particular universe, let alone finding it?  One in a google-plex, at least?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Such a situation may be outside even the limits of 'artistic license'.
</em><br />

<br />
We've worked out most of the details on a certain link between Earth and 
<br />
Mobius.  Can't give away details, though, but it has been considered.

<br />
I have already de-emphasized the list for the beginning.  But it still 
<br />
plays an important role in the initial setup.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As I understood the cartoon the technology on Mobius is far more  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; sophisticated than everything we have on Earth (anti-grav units, humanoid  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; robots, intelligent computer that fit into a persons pocket etc.). In  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; addition to that, none of us knows the environment there. What kind of  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; help could anyone of us be except making some chili dogs (with extra  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; relish) or being cannon fodder when it comes to a fight?
</em><br />

<br />
It's to be expected we have limited knowledge of Mobius.  That means we 
<br />
have to go through some training before going on real missions.  Even 
<br />
Tails had to go through some training.
