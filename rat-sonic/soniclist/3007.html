I dont know if any one cares but I came across an Interview with Yuji Naka
<br />
(creater of sonic/robotnik) .  Note this interview took place just before the
<br />
relase of sonic 2.
<br />

<br />
Interview with Yuji Naka: the creator of sonic the Hedgehog
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We recently had the opportunity to vist with Yuji Naka, the creator of
<br />
Sonic the Hedgehog, at the SEGA Technical Institute in Palo Alto,
<br />
Calfifornia.  Naka and the original Sonic team are currently working on sonic
<br />
the hedgehog 2, the exciting sequel planned for relase later this year.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of Japanese programmers and artists with local resources
<br />
make the development of sonic 2 a truly exciting American-Japanese joint
<br />
effort.
<br />

<br />

<br />
SEGA VISSONS:  We understand youre busy working on sonic the hedgehog 2.
<br />
&nbsp;What can you can you tell us about it?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: For one thing, sonic 2 is twice as long as sonic 1.  For another, sonic
<br />
has to run through more levels...many more then sonic 1.  Also, the new
<br />
Mobius worlds are brighter, crisper, and much more detailed.  However, we
<br />
think players will be too busy getting through the game to spend any time
<br />
enjoying the scenery.  Especially since sonic will have a new friend.
<br />

<br />
SV: A new friend?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: A fox with two tails.  We call him tails naturally.  He helps sonic out
<br />
of tight spots, and can help sonic defeat enemies.
<br />

<br />
SV: How many people are working on sonic 2?  How does this compare with the
<br />
oreiginal sonic 1?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: A total of 12 people are working on sonic 2.  Thats 30% more then
<br />
worked on the original game.  Its basically the same team as the original,
<br />
with another programer and more designers and artists.  The original team had
<br />
3 artists, 2 game designers and 3 sound and music guys.
<br />

<br />
SV: Who is writting the music?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: The bass player for the famous Japanese band called Dream Come True
<br />
wrote the original music for the game.  The other 2 guys worked on the sound
<br />
effects and on converting to a video game format.  The same guys are working
<br />
on the music for sonic 2.
<br />

<br />
SV: What were some of the things you thought about when you first created the
<br />
sonic character?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: At first we used a character that looked like a rabbit with ears that
<br />
could extend and pick up objects.  As the game got faster and faster, we
<br />
needed to come up with a special characteristic to give our character some
<br />
power over his enemies.  I rembered a character I had thought about years ago
<br />
who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies.  Hedgehogs can roll
<br />
themselfs into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.
<br />

<br />
SV: How about the name sonic?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: Because our new character could move really fast on the screen we were
<br />
looking for a name that suggested speed.  One of the designers said
<br />
supersonic and the sonic part stuck.
<br />

<br />
SV: Where did the other characters in the game come from?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: We wanted one of the characters in the game to be eggshaped, so we
<br />
created Robotnik.  It was a great character, but since it couldnt be the main
<br />
character, we made him the bad guy.
<br />

<br />
SV: What were some of your other games?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: Ghouls &amp; Ghosts, Phantasy Star I and II and Super Thunder Bolt for the
<br />
Genesis.  For the Master System I did Phanstsy Star I, Space Harrier, Outrun,
<br />
Blackbelt, Spy Vs Spy, F16 Fighting Falcon, and Great Baseball.
<br />

<br />
SV: How and when did you get started creating video games?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: I joined SEGA in 1984, after I finished school.
<br />

<br />
SV: Were you programming games in school?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: I had a part time job  programming games while I was in school.  I
<br />
worked on Fujitsu and Sharp computers.  I joined Sega in Japan and then came
<br />
to America last year.
<br />

<br />
SV: What is your ongoing philosophy about creating video games?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: I want to make interesting games.  I want to show my dreams and visions
<br />
to kids.  But most important, I want to create something that will make the
<br />
player happy.  I want the player to be surprised and have fun.
<br />

<br />
SV: Do you have any advice for people who want to creat video games?
<br />

<br />
NAKA: Yes.  Play lots of games.  Not just play them to win, but think about
<br />
them critically and analyze their strengths and weaknesses, constantly
<br />
looking for ways to improve them.  They should also draw on their own
<br />
experciences for insperation.  Everything I do in my daily life, I think
<br />
about how it would fit into a game.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During our vist to the SEGA Technical Instittute, we confirmed what we
<br />
had suspected all along--sonic 2 is going to be the hottest title of the
<br />
year.  Period.  Heres why:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic 2 is bigger, faster, more challenging, and more fun then the
<br />
original.  It has more levels, with a secret zone that you'll have to work
<br />
hard to find, a new bonus rounds that youll have to get through to get the
<br />
Chaos Emeralds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic 2 will be coming out on Genesis, Game Gear, and Seag CD.  The
<br />
increased capacity of the Sega CD version will allow addational zones, as
<br />
well as special bonus rounds between zones.  In these bonus rounds, sonic
<br />
takes you on a first person roller coster ride, a half pipe maze complete
<br />
with enemies, traps and dead ends.  You control sonic as he tries to get
<br />
through the maze, and you go with him as he takes on those 360 degree loops
<br />
and 90 degree turns.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And thats just between the zones.  All versions of sonic 2 will have new
<br />
zones, with new tricks, new enemies, and new challenges.  Wait till you try
<br />
the new Green Hill Zone, or the new Metropolis Zone, or the Chemical Factory.
<br />
&nbsp;Or Death Egg, where you get to visit Robotniks ship.
<br />

<br />
The Hill Top Zone will take sonic to new heights.
<br />

<br />
The Chemical Factory Zone is the acid test of sonics prowess.
<br />

<br />
The New Green Hill Zone is even bigger and more challenging then the
<br />
original.
<br />

<br />
The Green Hill Zone has sonic and his friend running through corkscrews and
<br />
other strange structures.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Well hope you enjoyed.
<br />
