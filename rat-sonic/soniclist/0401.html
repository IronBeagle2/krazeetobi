Agreed, though I personally find having someone's mitts on the second
<br />
controller helps out in a number of sections; there are some powerups in
<br />
S3&amp;K that you can't reach without a helifox lift, and even some that only
<br />
Tails Alone can get.  Plus, Tails can bop the bosses without costing Sonic
<br />
rings.  But since this isn't a game-tips list, I'll return to
<br />
considerations of character... 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails however is mostly a cute-looking and adorable fox. In 'Sonic II'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; he is only 6 1/2 years old (according to the manual) and only 10 years
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in the cartoon. To my opinion this is a little too young to fight
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Robotnik all alone during the _whole_ game. 
</em><br />

<br />
First off, whoever said he wasn't 'cool'?  Sure, he doesn't have an
<br />
attitude problem like Sonic does, but anyone who can take out Sonic 2's
<br />
Robosonic in less than 15 seconds deserves some respect.  (If you're
<br />
interested in this way-cool-looking technique, send me email.)  He flies,
<br />
he swims, he gets places Sonic couldn't get, and Super Tails gets monster
<br />
killer death birds at his beck and call.  I'd say he's qualified to be a
<br />
hero all by his lonesome. 
<br />

<br />
Second, he doesn't have to fight *Robotnik*.  Or, at least, his objective
<br />
doesn't have to be to *defeat* Robotnik.  In the below-mentioned scenario,
<br />
he'd be trying to rescue Sonic, at least initially; another possible plot
<br />
(like platformers need a plot) would be that he's trying to locate some
<br />
exotic medicine/power crystal/wand of wishing that can only be found at
<br />
the top of Unclimbable Mountain, or in the depths of Bottomless Lake, or
<br />
some other non-Sonic-accessible place... Robotnik would keep getting in
<br />
the way, but Tails' objective would be to get *past* him, get the wonder
<br />
object, and bring it back to Knothole. 
<br />

<br />
Third, Sonic really *can't* be in a Tails game, at least not in a playable
<br />
role, if you want it to focus on the HFF; either you could play Sonic as
<br />
the lead character, in which case it'd be Sonic 4, or you couldn't, in
<br />
which case all the Sonic fans would be grousing.  IMHO. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Heroes don't just run into traps and then wait to be rescued (there are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; numerous examples for this). If they _really_ get cought they find a way
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to get out themselves. 
</em><br />

<br />
Okay, how about this: Sonic gets captured somehow.  Tails goes to rescue
<br />
him-- no time to return to Knothole for reinforcements-- only to find out
<br />
Sonic's improvised his own escape; Robotnik's goons detect Tails and start
<br />
chasing him through various Zones.  Meanwhile, in a series of intermission
<br />
screens, we see that Sonic's returned to Knothole, having assumed the
<br />
two-tailed one made a strategic retreat; upon finding out the truth, he
<br />
sets out to rescue the fox in distress, only to be continually forced to
<br />
make detours that keep him one step behind (Tails flies up a cliff face
<br />
and Sonic has to run around it; Tails swims into an underground passage
<br />
and Sonic has to find another way in; Tails sets up a cave-in behind
<br />
himself to slow down the Swatbots and Sonic has to cut his way through...)
<br />
In the end, Tails is forced to battle Robotnik's latest evil creation, and
<br />
is outmatched, but Sonic shows up just in time to disable its impenetrable
<br />
force shield (at the cost of frying himself into incapacitation); now it's
<br />
up to Tails to save his friend and all of Mobius... 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; However, it is possible that Sonic (or another suitable character) would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aid young Tails in his first solo adventure. Then in the last level they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; could get separated and Tails has to take the final challenge alone
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (Tails _is_ a tough fighter when he is forced to be). 
</em><br />

<br />
I could see this working two ways:
<br />

<br />
* Sonic makes cameos doing various useful things (like digging passages
<br />
through rockfaces or a wild spin-dash all over the screen to nuke all the
<br />
Badniks).  Possibly you could collect Sonic icons and save up his
<br />
assistance to use repeatedly on the bosses. 
<br />

<br />
* Sonic is the second character.  This is pretty much Sonic 4 where the
<br />
player has chosen Tails &amp; Sonic instead of Sonic &amp; Tails, but would still
<br />
be cool.  I still think Super Tails should have been able to go to the
<br />
Doomsday Zone... but I digress again. 
<br />

<br />
On the topic of free choice of character pairs...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; That's a _very_ good idea. But don't forget that Sonic has to look cool
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in every situation (that's his charisma). It wouldn't look cool if he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; acted like Tails when controlled by the CPU (stomping merrily into
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traps, enemies, shots etc.). If this feature will be added, the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; programmers _definitely_ have to work out some sophisticated routines to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; let the CPU played character avoid these things. 
</em><br />

<br />
Well, I wouldn't mind having Sonic blunder once in a while, but it would 
<br />
be a neat game feature if he wouldn't just trail behind Tails but would 
<br />
actively take out Badniks as they went.  Of course, if Sonic gets it, so 
<br />
should everyone else; CPU Tails should offer helifox lifts, CPU Knuckles 
<br />
should break open passages, that sort of thing.
<br />

<br />
...so, all two of you who read this far, what do you think?  (:3

It's not the fall that hurts.  It's the sudden stop at the end.
