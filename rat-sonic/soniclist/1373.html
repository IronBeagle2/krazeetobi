<br />Part 6
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic knocked weakly on Sally's door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!  What happened?  You okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails is fine.  We got him back, and Bookshire's looking him over right 
<br />
now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally breathed a huge sigh of relief.  &quot;Oh, that's good to hear.  Are 
<br />
Tolouse and Todd okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked down.  &quot;Tolouse is okay.  He's over at Bookshire's, too.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cold chill went down Sally's back.  &quot;W-what about Todd?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked up at her again, silent for a long time.  Finally he spoke, 
<br />
his voice even quieter than before.  &quot;Tails is fine,&quot; he said again.  &quot;Todd...  
<br />
Todd saved his life.&quot;  He fell silent again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tear came to Sally's eye.  &quot;Oh, no...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic only nodded.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse climbed slowly up the tree, ready to start his turn of sentry duty.
<br />
It was late at night, and the sky was both cloudless and moonless, the stars 
<br />
proudly displaying themselves without any competition.  When he reached the 
<br />
platform, he found Antoine snoring away.  Tolouse decided to let him sleep while
<br />
he looked out at the sky.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse tried to think, but he couldn't form his thoughts any more 
<br />
coherently than he had his words that day, which was to say with any 
<br />
comprehension.  His mind recycled the same scenes over and over from the past 
<br />
couple of days: the... &quot;event&quot; itself, coming home, explaining to Sally, 
<br />
Bookshire and the others what had happened, the little memorial service they had
<br />
had for Todd, his feeble attempt at saying something at the service...  Finally,
<br />
his mind pushed out one clear thought, and he sighed, looking at the stars.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goodbye, Todd.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;MOMMY!!&quot;...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the pain was finally gone.
<br />
<br />The End.
