<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The beginning was a bad start for me, since it seemed to be basically a 
</em><br />
rip-off of Indiana Jones and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  And shouldn't the 
<br />
guardian of the Island (these days, Knuckles) be able to bypass all those 
<br />
traps and stuff?  And death-traps seem a bit out-of-character for Knuckles'
<br />
ancestors - were they so anti-technology they'd _kill_ to prevent it from 
<br />
getting out?  &lt;
<br />

<br />
Sorry you didn't like the Indiana Jones riff, but we were determined to get
<br />
the series off with a bang. However, don't chalk up the death-traps entirely
<br />
to the echidnas who disavowed technology. There are more than a few secrets
<br />
to the Grand Conservatory waiting to be revealed. A hint of things to come is
<br />
revealed in issue #3.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And I have a hard time believing Knuckles is enough of an 
</em><br />
athlete to have escaped all those traps (and a harder time about his 
<br />
dreadlocks enabling him to fly).&lt;
<br />

<br />
Whether or not YOU chose to believe KNUCKLES has the ability to survive all
<br />
those traps is one thing. It wasn't just athletic ability alone, he had to
<br />
outwit the gauntlet as well. As for his powers of flight, SEGA says he can
<br />
GLIDE through the air. It works for me.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So Archimedes is an evolved fire-ant who dresses like Crocodile Dundee?
</em><br />
Sorry, didn't work for me, but I don't believe in evolution (even if I did, 
<br />
to go from ants like we have today to sentience in a few hundred years (how 
<br />
old _is_ the Floating Island anyway?) is a bit much to swallow...)&lt;
<br />

<br />
Who said we showed only a few hundred years of history? And who says those
<br />
fire-ants WEREN'T on the same intelligence level as Archimedes? We could
<br />
barely squeeze in the plot points and characterizations that we did.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Speaking of swallowing: not to restart the &quot;what meat do sentient furries 
</em><br />
eat?&quot; thread, but I found it ironic that Archimedes was an ant and echidnas 
<br />
are spiny ANT-eaters... :^)&lt;
<br />

<br />
This was DELIBERATE on our part, and we address this with great relish (pun
<br />
intended) in the second issue.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And Enerjak being Dimitri after a long nap - I get the feeling of &quot;been 
</em><br />
there done that&quot; but we'll see where you take it...&lt;
<br />

<br />
Maybe you have, but what about the kids who are part of the audience as well?
<br />
My nine year old son and his friends are eating this stuff up.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bottom line: I've never been a Knuckles fan either, and only put up with 
</em><br />
him because he was part of Sonic's world.  I'll see the mini-series 
<br />
through, but if it becomes a regular series, I'll probably give it a pass - 
<br />
the characters aren't cute furries like the Freedom Fighters, and my other
<br />
tastes in comic books run more towards superheroes (which ended with Crisis 
<br />
on Infinite Earths - don't get me started on that), and Star-Trek, which 
<br />
also recently ended.  I also collect Disney, but don't make a great effort 
<br />
to find the time to read them.  Anyway, to get back on topic: I'd rather 
<br />
see more effort put into the Freedom Fighters (e.g., another Princess Sally 
<br />
or Tails mini-series).&lt;
<br />

<br />
This is a legitimate POV. However, if this does become a regular series,
<br />
you'll be missing out on some interaction with SONIC and the FF if you do.
<br />
(You have heard of crossovers, haven't you?) Also, initial reaction to the
<br />
KNUCKLES mini-series seems to be STRONGER than PRINCESS SALLY or TAILS. If
<br />
sales supports this, it's a good chance there'll be more of everyone's
<br />
favorite echidna. And Archie isn't playing favorites either. They would love
<br />
to see a TAILS or PS series do as well as SONIC. It's you the fans who
<br />
determine what is produced and what isn't.
<br />

<br />
