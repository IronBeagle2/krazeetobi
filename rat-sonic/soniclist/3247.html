#36 [July 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaziante cover art -- the castle and carved gates don't
<br />
figure into the story, but who cares?  Another masterpiece.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heart of Darkness (3 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Ken Penders; Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOYOTOHO!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, Rotor hasn't tuned into Bayreuth to watch the Flight of
<br />
the Valkyrie.  What he DOES have is a &quot;live&quot; remote from the
<br />
&quot;Zone of Silence.&quot;  Isn't that the same thing as &quot;The Void&quot;? 
<br />
After about 5 panels of explanation, some of the readers of this
<br />
list still seem uncertain on this point.  All I know is, it bears
<br />
no resemblance to the Void featured in the TV ep of the same
<br />
name.  In any event, the fact that it isn't the Void is offered
<br />
up by Rotor as a way of explaining why previous attempts to
<br />
travel there and back again were so easy.  But in a more
<br />
important complication, there are serious power reading coming
<br />
from Robotropolis.  Sonic goes to investigate, and arrives to
<br />
find Snively at the controls of some kind of beam generator which
<br />
reminds me too much of the climax of &quot;All Good Things...&quot;, the
<br />
final ep of &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (now that Ken
<br />
Penders has revealed himself to have worked on Star Trek comics
<br />
I'm keeping my copy of the _Star Trek Encyclopedia_ close at hand
<br />
to check for references, though the STE as a reference work
<br />
suffers from flaws that range from annoying to unforgivable.  But
<br />
I digress...).  Sonic arrives and takes the device out of
<br />
commission, and Robotnik congratulates him on endangering all of
<br />
Mobius.  Cue the flashback for Sonic's (and our) benefit: Seems
<br />
that when Robotnik took over eleven years ago, he wanted to use
<br />
the Zone of Silence developed by his &quot;mentor&quot; Kodos as a sort of
<br />
interdimensional concentration camp.  Unfortunately, once he sent
<br />
King Acorn there he realized that it was unstable and would
<br />
absorb Mobius.  Subjecting the thing to a steady stream from a
<br />
photon cannon managed to keep it in check, but with the cannon
<br />
destroyed by Sonic alternative measures have to be taken. 
<br />
Robotnik gives Sonic an &quot;energy inhibitor&quot; which bears a striking
<br />
resemblance to a household bug bomb.  He convinces Sonic to
<br />
detonate it within the Zone; despite serious reservations, Sonic,
<br />
Sally, Tails, and Antoine enter the Zone, which basically looks
<br />
like Space, The Final Frontier(tm).  There, they confront the
<br />
dark rider flanked by some characters who look like they belong
<br />
in a game of Doom.  Sonic dispatches these bit players, but
<br />
before the rider/knight/whatever can draw a bead on Sonic, Sally
<br />
intervenes.  In the struggle, she knocks off his helmet and
<br />
reveals him to be...what the heck, someone of the list has
<br />
already spilled the beans...King Acorn!!!  Or a reasonable
<br />
facsimile thereof.  Actually, he's not that reasonable, for he
<br />
gives Sally a quick jolt with his lance for her troubles.  In
<br />
response, Sonic detonates the bug bomb -- don't ask me what the
<br />
practical results were because they're never spelled out.  Rotor
<br />
manages to drag the Mobians back through the portal before they
<br />
overshoot it, and a shaken and subdued Sally is probably thinking
<br />
that now she knows how Luke Skywalker must have felt at the
<br />
end of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back.&quot;  To be continued, somewhere
<br />
along the way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to think it was only three issues ago that we were
<br />
witnesses to some of the lamest excuses for storytelling ever,
<br />
even for the medium of comic books.  The improvement, both in
<br />
terms of complexity and emotional impact, has been quantum. 
<br />
Major kudos for both artwork and story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, does anyone besides me think that that WASN'T Sally's
<br />
father wearing that armor?  Not only did the Zone bear no
<br />
resemblance to the Void, but in the two TV eps where Sally and
<br />
her father were reunited [&quot;Blast To The Past, Part 1&quot; and &quot;The
<br />
Void&quot;] Sally's father didn't fail to recognize her.  That didn't
<br />
happen this time, which makes it all just a little too
<br />
unconvincing.  I'm also haunted by Robotnik's aside on page 9
<br />
about Sonic doing his &quot;dirty work&quot; for him.  It leaves me with
<br />
the strong impression that Robotnik knew precisely what effect
<br />
the bug bomb would have in the Zone.  So the question remains:
<br />
whom did Sonic destroy?  Possible candidates:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A. the real King Acorn
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Kodos as King Acorn
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. a parallel King Acorn (cf. &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D. None of the above
<br />
And judging from the effects of the bug bomb in the Zone, I feel
<br />
pretty safe in saying that whoever it was was destroyed when it
<br />
detonated.  Which has major consequences from Sally's point of
<br />
view: can she really feel close to the hedgehog who (she may
<br />
believe) assassinated her father?  I don't envy Ken Penders his
<br />
job: this story's opened some major pitfalls and trap doors, and
<br />
it's his burden to resolve matters plausibly (unlike the
<br />
conclusion to &quot;Growing Pains&quot;).  Stay tuned; you can bet I will!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Sense of History: Part 3&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders/Art: Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No wonder Ken P. has been waiting for this review!  Let's
<br />
recap the story to date: Dmitri has just used the &quot;chaos siphon&quot;
<br />
to trash eleven of the 12 Chaos Emeralds that hold up the
<br />
floating island.  He has taken his brother and some of the
<br />
leaders of echidna society prisoner.  He has already directed the
<br />
resident &quot;mecha-nauts&quot; to enslave the populace, and once the
<br />
island is equipped with sails he plans to similarly conquer the
<br />
rest of the planet.  In the midst of this raving, however, it
<br />
develops that his fortress Mt. Fate has been subverted from
<br />
within: the foundation has been eroded by fire ants and the place
<br />
starts collapsing.  The imprisoned echidnas escape and Dmitri is
<br />
buried beneath the rubble.  The Magistrate gratuitously quotes
<br />
from the Book of Proverbs and declares that Dmitri's end was as
<br />
much a result of the society's trust in science resulting in
<br />
hubris as it was Dmitri's own madness.  This led to a certain
<br />
overreaction as the echidnas destroyed their city and appointed a
<br />
guardian over the last remaining emerald.  Which, several
<br />
generations later, turns out to be Knuckles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what's this all have to do with the plot?  (Remember the
<br />
plot?)  Knuckles suddenly starts putting it together: he
<br />
remembers the words &quot;Grand Conserve&quot; from issue #31(!) and
<br />
realizes that it refers to The Grand Conservatory, an underground
<br />
warehouse where artifacts of echidna society were stored.  He
<br />
believes that this is where Archimedes (remember him?) is hiding
<br />
out and where the missing Chaotix (remember them?) are being
<br />
held.  So, as Bill Cosby said in the course of one of his comedy
<br />
routines: &quot;I told you that story to tell you this one.&quot;  And once
<br />
more quoting his father (who was apparently named George
<br />
Santayana) he reminds us of the plot and begins his segue to his
<br />
miniseries (conveniently advertised on the facing page).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEW!  I know that this process took longer than
<br />
anticipated, what with the addition of three 2-pagers over the
<br />
course of three months, but Kanterovich &amp; Penders came pretty
<br />
darn close to losing the audience there.  In any event, the ad
<br />
for the miniseries pretty well telegraphs the plot based on what
<br />
went before: Dmitri vs. Knuckles.  BTW, I wouldn't make too much
<br />
of the movie poster format.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: Who was it that said &quot;We buy the product so we
<br />
can read about Sonic and Tails, not Scott and Paul.&quot;  Oh, yeah,
<br />
it was me...in my review of #29.  Nice to know the Fredster is
<br />
willing to listen; by keeping the Blue Blur front and center in
<br />
the &quot;office humor&quot; section [drawn by Spaziante] he actually
<br />
managed to come up with something funny!  Senor Mendez limits
<br />
himself to less than 2 column inches of self-introduction before
<br />
going on to &quot;what you really want to know: mainly Sonic the
<br />
Hedgehog!&quot;  [By George, I think he's got it!]  Topics: the launch
<br />
of the Knuckles miniseries; a story titled &quot;The Fall of
<br />
Robotropolis&quot; by DeCesare and Thomas (after his debut in &quot;To Bot
<br />
or Not To Bot&quot; in #34); plus further developments on the King
<br />
Acorn plot set up by &quot;Heart of Darkness.&quot;  Letters: Kim Wessels
<br />
of Des Moines agrees with Tails that it's rough being treated
<br />
like a kid.  In answer to a barrage of questions, the person
<br />
writing the replies pegs the birthdates of Sonic, Tails, and
<br />
Knuckles to the release dates of the Sonic 1, 2 and 3 games
<br />
respectively.  However, he punts the question as to whether the
<br />
TV series is still on the air -- this reply must have been locked
<br />
in months ago, before the USA Network picked up Sonic's option. 
<br />
And in a major concession to the comic's popularity, there's a
<br />
list of people who sent in letters and fan art that didn't get
<br />
published but who still might love seeing their names in print. 
<br />
Fred, I like your style!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaziante cover art for #37 shows Sonic holding a
<br />
(lifeless?) Sally in his arms.  Is it possible for Spaziante NOT
<br />
to do a cool cover that involves Sally?  Looks like the train is
<br />
definitely back on the rails!  Double-bag this puppy!
