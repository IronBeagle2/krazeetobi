Hi everyone... I had posted this info around 3 weeks ago on 
<br />
alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog, and was asked if I could send this to the List, so 
<br />
here it is.  :)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;-=-=-=-=-
<br />

<br />
Okay folks.  Now for a little lesson on Sonic.  :)
<br />

<br />
But first, a bit of legal stuff.  This information comes from either one of 
<br />
two sources:
<br />
1) &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Official Stylebook and Character Manual&quot; (c) 1994 
<br />
SEGA
<br />
or
<br />
2) &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog Bible, August 1991&quot; (c) 1991 SEGA
<br />
Both used without permission (oops!).  Footnotes indicate which book the
<br />
information came from.  Any spelling errors are my own, unless so denoted
<br />
by &quot;sic&quot;.  :)
<br />

<br />
Now on with the session. Here's some information about Sonic's biography,
<br />
abilities, attitude, etc.
<br />

<br />
BIOGRAPHY (book 1)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic The Hedgehog --- the fastest, coolest hedgehog anywhere.  It's
<br />
more than just speed - it's his wit, that won't quit.  He's all heart,
<br />
and super smart!  Sonic's always racing from one place to the next ---
<br />
barely stopping to catch his breath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sonic developed his incredible speed, his attitude became
<br />
legendary.  This Dude with a 'Tude is irreverent, confident, impatient
<br />
and constantly bursting at the quills with energy.  Above all, he's the
<br />
bravest big-hearted hedgehog anywhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's way cool, power red sneakers blast him around at supersonic
<br />
speeds without burning through their soles.  Our hero's favorite color
<br />
is --- you guessed it:  blue!  He loves gumballs and chili dogs, too, but
<br />
he hates water 'cause he can't swim.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is always there for his friends --- they know they can count
<br />
on him, especially in times of trouble.  It all comes down to loyalty,
<br />
and important quality that this hedgehog is full of --- among other
<br />
things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Sonic really wants is for life to return to the way it was ---
<br />
before Dr. Robotnik took over, polluted the planet and roboticized
<br />
everyone.  To free his friends from the Dr.'s grasp, Sonic must trash
<br />
Robotnik and his vile eggomatic machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Sonic will go into a Supersonic Spin Attack --- whatever
<br />
happens, watch out.  'Cause the super blue hedgehog is... UP... OVER ---
<br />
AND GONE!
<br />

<br />
MENTAL ABILITIES (book 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic thinks he's perfect, but he's not!  Forest-smart, Sonic is of
<br />
average intelligence.  He has to struggle to figure out the solution to a
<br />
problem or puzzle.  usually, he relies on his great charm and physical
<br />
capabilities to get out of tight spots.  Sonic never analyzes a
<br />
situation, he just plunges in.  He's a Hedgehog of Action.
<br />

<br />
ATTITUDE, PERSONALITY (book 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefree and radically cool --- that's what Sonic is all about.
<br />
Nothing deep.  That's not to say Sonic is an airhead!  When he's not
<br />
teasing you or playing a joke on you, he's probably the best friend you
<br />
could ever hope for.  He cares about his forest pals and delights in
<br />
coming to their rescue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic does not swear, take drugs, harm the environment, or eat
<br />
anything that one might consider healthy.  he does make mistakes ---
<br />
quite a few of them --- but not without regret.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there's Sonic's Attitude.  When he wants something, he goes for
<br />
it --- 150%.  Sonic does not respond well to authority --- he's juat(sic)
<br />
too impulsive.  He's cocky, independent, self-assured, but never
<br />
obnoxious or cruel.
<br />

<br />
LIKES, DISLIKES (book 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic loves any thing or any way to move through life at top speed.
<br />
His favorite diet?  Fast food and candy bars --- what else!  Sonic loves
<br />
burgers, tacos, nachos, fries, anything chocolate, and cola.  Sonic
<br />
doesn't eat or drink diet anything --- he needs the calories!  (A note
<br />
from me:  it appears Sonic's chili dog fetish developed AFTER the bible
<br />
had been printed.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more clue about Sonic's personality --- he's more than a bit
<br />
vain about his blue spikes.  His spikes are always perfect.  In Sonic's
<br />
world, slobs finish last.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when he does slow down, there's nothing Sonic likes more than
<br />
exploring new places, playing practical jokes, or playing video games.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patience is not one of Sonic's strong points.  When he feels the
<br />
pace is too slow, he'll cop his trademark &quot;What's the matter with you,
<br />
dude!&quot; attitude and tap his foot with impatience.
<br />

<br />
OBJECTIVES IN LIFE (book 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's objectives in life are to have fun and enjoy the ride!  Life
<br />
is a blast, if you don't stop to think about it --- that sums up Sonic's
<br />
philosophy.  As long as he had his supersonic speed, his sneakers, and
<br />
his good buddies, Sonic is one cool and happy dude.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Hope you enjoyed it!  I'll post info on Robotnik and Tails in a few days.
<br />

<br />
