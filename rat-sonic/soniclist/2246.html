<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, folks, this is my first post to the mailing list.  Hope it 
<br />
makes it to you all.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've been writing fan fics for a while now, and this is the Sonic 
<br />
one that I've done in the Blood and Metal storyline with David Gonterman.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to share it with all of you on the list, if you haven't 
<br />
already seen it on David's web page.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you like it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remain,
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most sincerely,
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Edward Becerra

Visions in the Wind: Beginnings
<br />

<br />
by Ed Becerra.
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rolling prairie, somewhere on Mobius.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's nighttime.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A coyote is sitting in the grass, legs crossed, in front of a small,
<br />
dying fire.  He looks up, to the distant stars.  His eyes glow with a
<br />
brilliant golden light.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hasn't taken either food or water for some days now.  He's been
<br />
fasting, for a spiritual quest.  His name is Edward Anthony Coyote, but for
<br />
some time now, the rest of the Wild Pack has simply called him &quot;Kickaha&quot;.
<br />
It means 'Trickster' in the old tongue.  They had a good reason for it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha's spirit isn't here.  That's what the fasting is supposed to do.
<br />
Free the spirit from the body.  Right now, Edward's spirit is speaking with
<br />
his guide.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere else...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Alright, alright, already!  I'm here.  Whaddaya want this time?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#There's someone new on Mobius.  Someone I want to meet.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*There's someone new on Mobius every day.  They're called &quot;babies&quot;.
<br />
&lt;snicker&gt;*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#I _meant_, there is someone new on Mobius, who isn't _FROM_ Mobius.
<br />
He's from the Earth.  I think he's one of my children.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Hey, you got enough children to fill a sports stadium.  What do ya need
<br />
with this one?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#I believe he's one of _us_.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Uh-oh.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Uh-huh.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*So...  Why haven't you spoken to him about it?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#I've tried.  He can't hear me.  Somebody needs to tell him about me, an=
<br />
d
<br />
point him in the right direction.  Towards me.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Lemme guess.  I'm elected.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Bright boy!  Give that coyote a peace pipe and tell him what he's won.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*If I know you, it's a no-expenses paid trip to the other side of
<br />
Mobius.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Right the first time.  So here's what I want you to do.  You're going t=
<br />
o
<br />
travel to the Great Forest, and find a hidden village called Knothole.
<br />
That's where Princess Sally's Freedom Fighters live.  When you get there,
<br />
find the tall fox with the robotic arm called Davey Crockett.  He's the
<br />
one.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*I thought you said he was from Earth.  They only have humans there.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#It's a long story.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Right.  Figures.  So I'm supposed to guide him to you, the way the
<br />
shaman did with me?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Yes.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Fifty Mobians says it's a VERY long walk.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#You'd win that bet, if I'd taken it.  So you'd better get back to your
<br />
body, and get started.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Just my luck.  How am I supposed to recognize him?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#He's got a cyborg arm.  How hard can it be?#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*_That's_ a stupid question, Old Man.  You're a spirit of mischief.
<br />
Murphy's your beer buddy and poker pal.  Whatever CAN go wrong is definitel=
<br />
y
<br />
GONNA go wrong.  You think I haven't noticed?  With our luck, there's
<br />
probably five hundred cyborg foxes out there.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#&lt;embarrassed look&gt; Never mind that.  Just go.  With your injuries,
<br />
you're going to need all the head start that you can get.  Besides, there's
<br />
a surprise in it for you.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*What?*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#If I told you, it wouldn't be a surprise.  Now go.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*All right.  But you're going to owe me for this one.  Big time.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a quiet moment.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Thank you...  Grandson.#
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Don't mention it...  Grandfather.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back on the prairie...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha rises painfully, and if there were anyone watching they'd notice
<br />
his twisted back as he stands.  The golden light fades from his eyes.  He
<br />
reaches for the ironwood throwing cane lying beside him.  He ties up his
<br />
bedroll, and lashes it to his pack.  He carefully puts out the coals of his
<br />
campfire and throws his pack across his shoulders.  Taking his cane in his
<br />
right paw, he limps off into the starry night.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, if I can only remember which way the Great Forest is...&quot; he
<br />
mutters.  &quot;Rassafrassin' furshlugginer felgercarbin' _at_#^$вд*%&amp;!...  &quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His voice fades into the silence.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Be Continued...
<br />
