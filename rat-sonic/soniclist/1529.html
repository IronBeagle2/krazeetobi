<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 1
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was setting on the Great Forest.  They knew they
<br />
didn't have much time left.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic the Hedgehog didn't like all this sneaking around. 
<br />
The direct approach had always worked for him...well, almost
<br />
always...and he preferred it to stealth.  But he knew that the
<br />
objective would soon be in sight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short distance away, hidden from him, Sally lay in
<br />
waiting.  For her, there was only one objective: stop Sonic at
<br />
all costs!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor and Bunnie were nearby as well, paused and waiting
<br />
for some cue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the moment, Antoine was lost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why am I always to be given such unuseful directions?&quot; he
<br />
thought to himself. &quot;If I was not knowing for better or for
<br />
worse, I would be saying to myself that I am trying to be
<br />
avoided!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light began to fail as night closed in.  The others
<br />
would have to act soon, he knew, and he intended to be in on the
<br />
action.  But it didn't help if he was lost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not daring to call out and give himself away, Antoine began
<br />
slowly backing up.  There was a hint of an autumn chill in the
<br />
early evening air and the floor of the Great Forest already had a
<br />
few dead leaves which, if stepped on, could give away Antoine's
<br />
position.  As he moved back, he brushed against the trunk of a
<br />
young tree.  It bent just enough to release a branch that had
<br />
fallen from another tree overhead.  The groundfall struck just
<br />
next to Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Help!  Help!  It is the invasion!  We are doom-ed!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of sheer terror, Antoine ran.  It didn't matter to him
<br />
at the moment just where he was running to.  He darted straight
<br />
ahead and plunged through a bush.  As he did so, he fell to the
<br />
ground.  In his fall, he grabbed at something--a small square of
<br />
red cloth tied to a stick.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine!&quot; Sally yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked at the object in his hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have done it?  Yes!  Yes!  I am *triomphant*!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, man!&quot; Sonic groaned.  The others began to come out of
<br />
hiding.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie!&quot; Sally snapped, &quot;you were supposed to go for it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No way, Sal!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You said Ah was supposed to run interference for you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I said ROTOR was supposed to run interference!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought I was supposed to be guarding the flag!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Some kind of guarding, if you let Antoine get it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now waiting a minute!  Princess or non,....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And soon everyone was talking at once and the scene looked
<br />
like an argument among a group of ten-year-olds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which was only fitting, since they WERE a group of ten-year-
<br />
olds.
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 2
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few Mobians had ever heard of Knothole, and fewer still knew
<br />
its precise location.  That knowledge had been reserved for a
<br />
handful of members of the King's court.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of an alternate command post had occurred to 
<br />
King Acorn and several of his advisors during the Great War, at a
<br />
time when there was a very real threat to the safety of
<br />
Mobotropolis.  Yet with the easing of that threat, the King
<br />
appeared to lose interest in the concept.  The truth, however,
<br />
was something else again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to conceive of the proposed royal redoubt in the
<br />
peacetime role of a retreat--a protected place where he, his
<br />
family and selected members of the court could go to get a
<br />
different perspective on things or simply to relax.  Taking only
<br />
a few into his confidence, he suggested modifications in the
<br />
already-secret project.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the King was to be credited with the location of the
<br />
site (which he had stumbled upon in the Great Forest in his
<br />
youth while exploring), it was Sir Charles Hedgehog who had
<br />
planned the site as a base of operations, and then modified the
<br />
plans for more peaceful purposes once the tide of battle had
<br />
turned.  Truth to tell, the layout and planning of Knothole was
<br />
more to Charles's taste than the war-work that had kept him busy
<br />
and that had earned him his knighthood.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knothole had many things going for it even before the first
<br />
pieces of timber were joined together.  Located deep in the Great
<br />
Forest in a slight depression, it was amply covered by foliage so
<br />
as to be virtually invisible from the air.  There were several
<br />
small clearings within walking distance that could act as landing
<br />
sites for hover units.  There was farmable land close by (equally
<br />
well camouflaged) and a river ran along the site.  Access to it
<br />
through the Great Forest was almost impossible unless one was
<br />
aware of the network of trails and paths that would take one to
<br />
it.  To bring any ground vehicle to the site was impossible; it
<br />
could only be reached on foot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, as much as Charles's own aesthetics, dictated that the
<br />
design for Knothole be one of rustic simplicity.  As much of the
<br />
material as possible would come from the Great Forest itself,
<br />
with some items brought to the sight (in secret) from the city. 
<br />
Work had progressed to the point where a half-dozen huts of
<br />
various sizes were finished as the Great War drew to a close.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then there was a new development to cope with: one that
<br />
called himself &quot;Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before his own capture, Charles had managed to arrange that
<br />
a handful of children and two adults be secreted in Knothole. 
<br />
The two adults were women, staff members of the royal household. 
<br />
Rosie, nanny for the Princess Sally Alicia, was an obvious
<br />
choice.  Sally was, after all, heir to the Mobian throne and was
<br />
a natural candidate to be hidden away in Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other adult had been recently retained to be Sally's
<br />
tutor: an older feline named Julayla.  She was reserved and, to
<br />
those who didn't know her, somewhat intimidating.  What was
<br />
intimidating was, in fact, her patience and circumspection. 
<br />
Unlike the open and affable Rosie, Julayla seemed at times to be
<br />
playing a perpetual chess game--sizing up moves, reviewing and
<br />
plotting strategy, seeking an overview of the situation.  She let
<br />
few have access to her mind and heart; eventually only Princess
<br />
Sally would have that distinction, and she found Julayla to be as
<br />
kind as she was wise, as tender as she was shrewd, as empathetic
<br />
as she was observant.  This complex character served as a balance
<br />
to the simple straightforwardness of Rosie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that Sally or any of the other children (who were all
<br />
friends of hers) could appreciate any of this when they first
<br />
arrived in Knothole as refugees.  For they had just seen their
<br />
families and their world destroyed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were a diverse group of children, all of them about 5
<br />
years old.  Yet at first they reacted to their new situation in
<br />
the same way.  It began with a reluctance to talk about what had
<br />
happened.  The pain of watching the arrival of the SWATbots, of
<br />
seeing parents, relatives and friends being captured and turned
<br />
into soulless mechanical caricatures of what they had once been,
<br />
was too much for their young minds.  The children pushed the
<br />
scenes from their consciousness by day, only to have the memories
<br />
trouble their dreams at night.  In the beginning, the woods
<br />
around Knothole were filled in the evening with the sound of
<br />
screaming as one or another of the children found themselves
<br />
haunted by their dreams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the children realized that Knothole had become for them a
<br />
safe place where Robotnik's SWATbots weren't going to intrude,
<br />
they began to display differing styles of adapting.  Rotor, a
<br />
young walrus, was thought at first to be the most serious
<br />
potential troublemaker.  He seemed most at ease when he was
<br />
destroying things.  It drove Rosie to distraction, but Julayla
<br />
counselled patience.  That patience was rewarded when, during one
<br />
trying stretch when Rotor had spent three straight days taking
<br />
things apart, he methodically made the rounds of the demolished
<br />
objects and put them all back together in less than a day's time.
<br />
In some cases, they worked better than before.  Julayla explained
<br />
that Rotor's mechanical aptitude was part of his way of coping
<br />
with the situation: demonstrating some form of mastery over a
<br />
world gone mad.  She encouraged him in his interest in things
<br />
mechanical and electronic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a different matter when dealing with Bunnie, a close
<br />
friend of Sally's and the only other girl among the children.  A
<br />
child of the southern provinces, she had no use for the
<br />
formalities and mannerisms of the royal court.  If she didn't
<br />
care for your company, she'd just as soon make a face at you than
<br />
politely tolerate you.  Yet this also gave her a free-and-easy
<br />
happiness that was delightful to behold.  She was extremely
<br />
conscious of the natural world around her, and especially so of
<br />
her own body.  The women did the best they could with Bunnie,
<br />
hoping against hope that she would grow out of some of her more
<br />
excessive behaviors by the time she began to mature.  It was with
<br />
Bunnie in mind that Rosie and Julayla declared the hut where the
<br />
two girls slept to be Off Limits to the boys.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bunnie was hard to deal with because she had not been
<br />
exposed to court manners, Antoine was even harder to deal with
<br />
because he had.  The young fox was the son of a minister in the
<br />
King's diplomatic service; as a result, he had virtually from
<br />
birth been exposed to the ways of the court.  In Knothole, he
<br />
clung to those ways with a fierce tenacity, as if he had
<br />
personally been charged with safeguarding those habits and
<br />
customs even if there was no royalty.  Yet if he was loyal to
<br />
those traditions, he was also so convinced of the rightness of
<br />
his loyalty that nobody could tell him anything.  It could be
<br />
almost impossible to correct him.  In time he even refused to
<br />
correct his speech--an atrocious mangling of the language by
<br />
someone who was not a native speaker.  He would back down when he
<br />
had to, but only to the grown-ups; he stubbornly held his own
<br />
against the other children and, despite taking his share of lumps
<br />
as a result, refused to yield.  Julayla wondered if there were
<br />
any way to sift through the chaff of arrogance to isolate the
<br />
loyalty beneath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of all the children, perhaps the easiest to understand was
<br />
Charles's nephew, Sonic Hedgehog, and that made him all the more
<br />
exasperating to deal with.  He was very straightforward in his
<br />
approach to life.  Unfortunately, in his quest for the immediate,
<br />
he would sooner take a shortcut than not.  It showed in his
<br />
schoolwork, for all the children had to spend their mornings in
<br />
Knothole's dining hall, which doubled as a classroom where
<br />
Julayla did the best she could with improvised materials. 
<br />
It was hard to say whose patience was put to the test more during
<br />
these sessions, Sonic's or Julayla's.  Somehow, Sonic needed a
<br />
steadying influence, and he found it in, oddly enough, a new
<br />
arrival to Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was when Sonic was about 7 years old that he disappeared
<br />
from Knothole one day.  This in itself was not unusual; he was
<br />
prone to making himself scarce when he didn't care for what was
<br />
happening.  Yet it was almost dusk when he returned without any
<br />
explanation as to where he had been, without apology, and with a
<br />
small child in tow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a fox cub, little more than a toddler.  Yet this fox
<br />
cub had not one, but two, tails.  Nobody knew how he could have
<br />
been born with two tails; the consensus was that he had been *in
<br />
utero* when Robotnik's systematic destruction of the planet and
<br />
his crash program of industrialization had begun to poison the
<br />
air and sky of Mobius.  The only other clue to his identity was
<br />
the name &quot;Miles Prower&quot; written on the inside of one of his
<br />
shoes.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic finally admitted what had happened: on a surreptitious
<br />
journey back to Mobotropolis, he had seen a fox couple, husband
<br />
and wife, hide the cub inside a dumpster just before being
<br />
apprehended by SWATbots.  Sonic had waited until they had been
<br />
taken away, then retrieved the cub.  Sonic never admitted it in
<br />
so many words--it would not have been cool for him to do so--but
<br />
it was clear to everyone that Sonic's heart had gone out to the
<br />
little cub from the first.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails,&quot; as the fox cub came to be called, grew into an
<br />
active and happy child, apparently unscarred by any memory of
<br />
being orphaned.  He was doted on by Rosie, and treated like a
<br />
plaything on occasion by the girls.  Yet his own attentions were
<br />
on Sonic.  As he grew older he was constantly shadowing the young
<br />
hedgehog, copying his speech and his mannerisms devotedly.  The
<br />
women worried that Sonic's ego was getting quite big enough,
<br />
thank you, without Tails' hero worship.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of all the children, Julayla was at the moment most
<br />
concerned about Princess Sally.  She was developing in a
<br />
natural, unstudied way.  She had a sharp intellect made sharper
<br />
by study, yet she was not bookish; physically, she was strong and
<br />
agile, and at an age when she might have been physically awkward
<br />
she carried herself with grace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But something was beginning to change, and the change was
<br />
worrying Julayla.  She could not yet sense what exactly, but it
<br />
was becoming clear to her that a part of Sally--a very vital
<br />
part--was dying.
