WHAT'S NEW?:
<br />
[Note: There WILL be spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]
<br />

<br />
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />
like:
<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
<br />
against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers on Fox.  This sounds
<br />
plausible, except that between the November and February sweeps,
<br />
ABC actually moved StH to the 8:00 am Eastern slot, which would
<br />
have put it opposite &quot;Dog City&quot; on Fox...at least, until the next
<br />
time Fox jazzed with ITS lineup.  I remember posting a TAPE ALERT
<br />
and that several fans didn't get to tape the first showing of the
<br />
Doomsday episode as a result of the time switch.  Source for this
<br />
item: someone from within the offices of Archie Comics.
<br />
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
<br />
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
<br />
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
<br />
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
<br />
you say &quot;anal retentive&quot;?).  Words were exchanged and the show
<br />
was effectively cancelled.
<br />
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
<br />
of &quot;two seasons and out&quot; for shows.  Though it's possible that
<br />
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
<br />
to begin with.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles 48 page special
<br />
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
<br />
&quot;Panic in the Sky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobians living on the western shore of &quot;the Great
<br />
Continent&quot; [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
<br />
another adjective besides &quot;Great&quot;: viz.: the Great Forest, the
<br />
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the &quot;all-purpose&quot;
<br />
use of the word _hriar_, or &quot;thousands&quot; by rabbits in Richard
<br />
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
<br />
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
<br />
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
<br />
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
<br />
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
<br />
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
<br />
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
<br />
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
<br />
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
<br />
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
<br />
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
<br />
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
<br />
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Robotnik is &quot;hijacking&quot; the island by
<br />
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
<br />
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
<br />
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
<br />
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
<br />
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
<br />
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
<br />
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
<br />
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear). 
<br />
But Knuckles replaces the &quot;real&quot; Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
<br />
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
<br />
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
<br />
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
<br />
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
<br />
&quot;Fire Drill&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
<br />
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
<br />
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
<br />
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
<br />
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
<br />
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
<br />
who knows?
<br />
&quot;Lord of the Floating Island&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
<br />
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
<br />
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
<br />
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
<br />
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
<br />
the island--how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
<br />
Knuckles' exit line: &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect
<br />
and serve!&quot;  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
<br />
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
<br />
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
<br />
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
<br />
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
<br />
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
<br />
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
<br />
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
<br />
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.
<br />

<br />
#25
<br />
&quot;Go Ahead...Mecha My Day&quot; (the only story in this issue)
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher
<br />
Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
based on summary by James Firmiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
<br />
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a &quot;zone portal.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
<br />
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Tails
<br />
investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To rescue
<br />
both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones and do
<br />
battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
<br />
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
<br />
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.

<br />

<br />
================================================================
<br />

<br />
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
<br />
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
<br />
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
<br />
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
<br />
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
<br />
there is no &quot;official&quot; explanation as to how Tails got that way,
<br />
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
<br />
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
<br />
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
<br />
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
<br />
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
<br />
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
<br />
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
<br />
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
<br />
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
<br />
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
<br />
Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
<br />
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
<br />
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
<br />
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
<br />
Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series
<br />
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
<br />
indicate that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative
<br />
differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally miniseries began
<br />
shipping the week of Feb 13.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />

<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings because the show was up
<br />

<br />
