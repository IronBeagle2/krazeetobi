<br />
Yesterday I actually sent my short stories to this mailing list , and
<br />
apparently got the address wrong . Anyway , today I read that stuff about not
<br />
posting fan fic to the list , so I guess that's out of the question . (
<br />
Apologies to whomever recieved those rather lengthy documents) .
<br />

<br />
Anyway , seeing that the Sonic web page ( <a href="http://rat.org/sonic/">http://rat.org/sonic/</a>) isn't going
<br />
to be updated till around May , I thought I'd just &quot;advertise&quot; for my stories
<br />
here instead , so that those who think they (the stories) sound ok can
<br />
e-mail me , and I'll send a copy to those interested . I just wrote them a
<br />
while back , and I'm new to this whole thing . 
<br />

<br />
Read the stuff below , and if any of the stories catch your interest and if you
<br />
don't want to wait till May to get them , e-mail me at vicl_at_pacific.net.sg for
<br />
a copy , which you will receive within a day or two from the time you contacted
<br />
me .
<br />

<br />

<br />
The following work is entirely original , to the best of my knowledge . As I've
<br />
said , I only recently started in this stuff , so people might have done this
<br />
before without me knowing ...
<br />

<br />
# 1  :  Temporal Trouble
<br />

<br />
David Prower ( Tails' cybernetic brother created by fanfic author Shawn Wolski )
<br />
is apparently lost during a freak accident , and Rotor has to find him . Sonic
<br />
admits his &quot;dislike&quot; for the cyberfox .
<br />

<br />
Personal Note : I can't really go into detail for this story , since elaborating
<br />
further would really spoil it .
<br />

<br />
# 2  :  Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part One
<br />

<br />
This story would probably fit in the Alternate Sonic Universes section of the
<br />
Sonic web page ( in the category &quot;Bloodlines&quot; is in )
<br />

<br />
This story revolves around Tails . The two tailed fox is fed up with the way the
<br />
Freedom Fighters treat him like a child . That however is about to change .
<br />
While on a long walk , comtemplating on that fact , Tails' loses his way , is
<br />
confronted and nearly killed by a wild animal , but is saved just in time by a
<br />
mysterious creature , who upon finding out who Tails is , leads him to meet
<br />
a person Tails never thought still existed . That person leaves Tails a legacy
<br />
the fox had never even dreamt of ....
<br />
Now with a devastating power backing Tails , the fox loses control of himself
<br />
temporarily , due to unforseen circumstances . During that time , Tails creates
<br />
big problems for Snively , who is now intent on catching and killing Tails ....
<br />

<br />
This is just a short description which does not cover all the parts of the 
<br />
story . 
<br />

<br />
# 3  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Two
<br />

<br />
This part of the story covers part of Tails' attempt at mastering his &quot;gift&quot; ,
<br />
with aid from unexpected sources . 
<br />

<br />
This part is rather short , so I can't go into detail 
<br />

<br />
# 4  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Three
<br />

<br />
This concludes the &quot;Of Foxes and Sorcery&quot; story . Snively goes into full swing
<br />
to capture Tails , causing dire side effects in the process . Though his 
<br />
original plan fails , circumstances created by the failure leaves room for a
<br />
secondary plan for Snively to capture the menace . Tails is eventually lured
<br />
to Robotropolis , due to circumstances beyond his control ... lured to the
<br />
trap that Snively has prepared for him .
<br />

<br />
This story had several references to violence ( not that much ) , and may not
<br />
agree with everyone . In my opinion , the story might also be considered 
<br />
slightly depressing .... but you decide for yourself .
<br />

<br />
# 5  : As the Wheel Turns
<br />

<br />
This story is set in the future , ten years after Snively's defeat . Mobius
<br />
is once again peaceful , but an important decision that its rulers have to make
<br />
might just have dire consequences ....
<br />

<br />
Like &quot;Temporal Trouble&quot; , I cannot reveal too much about this story . It is
<br />
however , in my opinion , quite an ok one ....
<br />

<br />
So , e-mail me if the stories interest you . The longest is Of Foxes and
<br />
Sorcery Part III ( about 8 pages ) , the shortest is Part II of the same story
<br />
( 2 pages ) .
<br />

<br />
Happy reading !
