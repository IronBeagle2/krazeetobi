<br />
Oh no... not this again :-)
<br />

<br />
Anyway... There are multiple refs (from Archie and possibly Sega) stating
<br />
that she's a squirrel (ground squirrel to be exact).  I've decided to 
<br />
accpet this.
<br />

<br />
But how do you explain the lack of tail?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well... Some species of ground squirrels have short tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OR
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be a 'royalty' thing to have the tail clipped at a young age. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Much the same way certain species of dogs get their tails clipped often
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. sheepdogs ... dobermans (sp?) )
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would explain her father not having a tail either (and possibly why
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine doesn't have a tail... we're not entirely sure what his origins
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;are... he could be associated with the royal family somehow... an 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;association which would require his tail be 'clipped'.  Isn't he 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Captain of the Guard&quot; or at least trying to be or something?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I had considered a third possiblity (she could've lost it earlier due to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a close scrape with Robotnik's forces) however when I saw that she had
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a short tail as a young girl in that 'Blast from the Past' episode I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;dismissed this possibility.... That's too bad... this might've been an
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;interesting story to write.
<br />

<br />
But what about her father being a fox?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In real life... mixing two species is generally a bozo-nono and will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;either result in nothing, or if you're lucky... a sterile cross-breed 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. Horse + Donkey = Mule... I THINK this is how it works)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In cartoons, you're often given a little leeway here.  I wrote up 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;something about 'cartoon genetics' a while back trying to explain
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;all of this.  It was long and complicated but generally said
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;when an inter-species couple has children there are generally three
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;possibilities .. depending on the cartoon series:
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The children inherit the species of the parent with the same sex. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e.g. A male fox and a female squirrel would bear fox boys and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;squirrel girls.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The children are a 'blend' of the two species.   
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) The children are one species or the other.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 'Sonic' universe, the first seems to be the rule although we can't
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;rule out the third possibility.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think she's a 'blend' because she looks quite different than any
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other foxes on the show or in the comics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion of all this is that Sally's  mother is a squirrel.  There 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;was a fanfic story which had Sally's mother in it (as a squirrel) so 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;someone out there belives this (or something like this) :-)
<br />

<br />
Anyway... I hope this helps :-)
<br />
