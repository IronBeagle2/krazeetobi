I came this close to absolutely screaming.
<br />

<br />
Going home for a few days before spring break officially began, I decided
<br />
to search my hometown for Sally #2 and Sonic #22.  Well, the comic book
<br />
shop closed down last month, so I resorted to searching every gas station,
<br />
every drug store, every grocery store, any place I could think of.  Nobody
<br />
had anything!!  Nada!  Only when I finally looked in the only book store in
<br />
town did I find the Sally issue, but Sonic was still nowhere to be found.
<br />

<br />
So, coming back to college, I journey to the comic book shop where I found
<br />
the two Sonic issues I had bought earlier, shortly after subscribing to this
<br />
list.  Well, they had it (along with Sally #1, which I had yet to find), but
<br />
their filing system left a lot to be desired.  Seems they don't think very
<br />
highly of  &quot;children's comics&quot; (including anything published by Archie)
<br />
so all of this month's titles were unceremoniously dumped into one big pile,
<br />
on top of the bins carrying back issues of children's stuff.   This means
<br />
I had to wade thru 10 gazillion Archie, Betty, Veronica, and other such issues
<br />
before finding what appeared to be the only Sonic #22 they had left! 
<br />
Sheesh...
<br />

<br />
Whoever said collecting comic books doesn't give you any exercise?? :-)
<br />

<br />
Oh well...my contribution to this thread is a little late, but here's my
<br />
thoughts on #22.
<br />

<br />
In a word: great!  Every Sonic issue should be like this.  The story
<br />
surrounding Robotnik's return was well done (even if the story surrounding
<br />
his initial disappearance was not), and the artwork (especially for Sally)
<br />
is spectacular.  Did somebody say that it was a new artist for this month?
<br />
Well, (s)he can stay!  I even enjoyed &quot;Tails' Knighttime Story.&quot;  This is
<br />
an example of Sonic-slapstick put to good use, and the jokes were hilarious.
<br />
(&quot;Have a real turkey,&quot; as he throws down Antoine :-D)
<br />

<br />
Here's hoping future issues are as good as this one.
<br />
On that matter, wish me luck finding #23 when it comes out! :-)
<br />

<br />
later---Kris
