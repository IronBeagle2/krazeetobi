<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were approaching Sally's hut when Rotor noticed them.  He remembered
<br />
Sandra and Williams from before, but didn't recognize the other two.
<br />
&quot;What's going on, Tails?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're VIPs from Wespero and are here to see the princess on an important
<br />
matter of global safety,&quot; explained Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SHE is not a VIP,&quot; he directed his statement to Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, she's just somebody we met on the way here.  We need to see the
<br />
princess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic said not to let anybody in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why not?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally's been hurt, badly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that all?  Sandra, move him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not.  &quot;I don't take orders from you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned.  &quot;Sandra, I am kindly asking you, not ordering you, to
<br />
help me out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She complied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you.&quot;  He opened the door and everybody came in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You.&quot;  Sonic also recognized the two.  &quot;And her.  Why are you here?  So
<br />
you can finish Sally off?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hardly.&quot;  Williams didn't take it personally, he liked having a
<br />
reputation.  &quot;I came about the creature, but I guess I have time to save her
<br />
life.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Save her life?  How can you--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She'll be better than ever in under four hours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's impossible!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Tails backed Williams up, &quot;he saved my life.  Let him help
<br />
Sally.&quot;  Sonic thought about it for a second.  He didn't know what to do.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let him try,&quot; encouraged Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although his gut feeling told him that Williams could not be trusted,
<br />
Sonic stepped out of the way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; said Williams, &quot;send a thousand of my nanites to Princess
<br />
Sally.&quot;  He walked over to a corner of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;  Sonic had NO idea what just happened.  Nothing happened!  How
<br />
can talking to a computer save Sally's life?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not going to explain it.  Not now, anyway.  Those who know, know.
<br />
Those who don't, don't need to.  How did this happen?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was keeping the creature busy and Sal was scanning it with Nicole.
<br />
Then it ignored me and whacked her with its tail.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, the mighty Sonic Hedgehog was outsmarted by a big, dumb creature.&quot;
<br />
He could tell he made Sonic angry.  &quot;Don't worry, it was my fault.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do we do now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We wait for her to get better.&quot;  For a while, they just waited.  Then
<br />
Williams simply left.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was sitting on a log next to the power ring pool when Adam soon joined
<br />
him.  Adam sat down on the log, &quot;What are you doing here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Waiting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're going to sit here for four hours?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Two and a half.  By then she should be conscious.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam thought about that for a while.  &quot;Robotnik's gone,&quot; he finally said.
<br />
&quot;There isn't much to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's always these people to torment, it keeps them on their toes.
<br />
Every once in a while, we help them, that keeps them guessing.  Why are
<br />
they here?  Are they going to help us?  Should we trust them?  Sonic thought
<br />
we were here to kill the princess, that's a reputation if anything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one else said anything for a while.  They could hear a noise coming
<br />
towards them.  It sounded much like a tiny hurricane or a breeze.  It kept
<br />
getting closer until it was directly over them, at which time it stopped and
<br />
Tails landed right in front of them, &quot;Will Aunt Sally be okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, you worry too much.  When I say she'll be better than ever in
<br />
four hours, she will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What will you do after she gets better?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll get rid of that creature.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And after that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our work will be done, we will leave.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But......I want you to stay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I appreciate that.  There's only one problem: where are you in the chain
<br />
of command?  Who can you convince to get us to stay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails had to stop and ponder.  Sonic wouldn't listen, Tails saw his
<br />
reaction.  Sally might after she found out Williams saved her life.  There
<br />
was only one person who would agree with him.  &quot;Nina would listen to me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah!  Nina!  Good, go get her.  She should be a part of this.&quot;  With
<br />
that, Tails was gone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why's Nina so important?&quot; asked Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She and Tails, and Sandra, are the only people here who actually trust
<br />
me.  They would back me up.  I'd consider them good friends.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandra?  The one who tried to kill you in the forest?  SHE is now your
<br />
friend but, saaaaay...THE PRINCESS isn't?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The princess would never trust me, not even after I saved her life.
<br />
Sonic?  Maybe by some miracle.  Sandra does.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She shouldn't.  Tails shouldn't either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But they do.  Don't you consider Nina a friend?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam thought about that.  &quot;Yeah,&quot; he sighed, &quot;okay.  But NOT Sandra.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You just don't know her well enough.&quot;  The conversation ended there.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not before long, Adam brought up an interesting point.  &quot;We're pretty
<br />
lucky.  I save Nina's life, you save the princess' life, we help get rid of
<br />
this creature.  When the princess takes the throne, we're going to be
<br />
famous.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;More than you think.  I also saved Tails' life.  And then there was that
<br />
thing with Sonic.  He would've been blown into a million, smoldering pieces
<br />
if it wasn't for me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I did save Kristen's life a few times.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hear a challenge.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, the creature is the deciding factor.  Whoever takes care of it is
<br />
the winner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Done.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around two hours and thirty minutes later, Williams opened the door to
<br />
Sally's hut.  Adam followed him in.  Everybody was there, it was somewhat
<br />
crowded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Adam!  Williams!&quot;  Nina ran over to them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I told you we'd see you again,&quot; reminded Williams.  He could see that
<br />
Sally was conscious.  &quot;I guess we should start with introductions.&quot;  He made
<br />
his way to a corner of the room.  All eyes were on him.  &quot;Everybody, I am
<br />
Gabriel Williams, but I go by Williams for reasons I don't want to go into.
<br />
This is Adam Lockard.&quot;  He dragged Adam into the spotlight.  &quot;And this is
<br />
Kristen Taylor.  We're all from Wespero and we came here to find help to get
<br />
rid of this creature.&quot;  He took a position next to Sandra.  &quot;Sandra
<br />
Nightweaver, she captured me a while ago and traded me to Packbell for a
<br />
hover unit.  But I still like her,&quot; he put his arm around her, &quot;it was fun.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No sooner did he finish his sentence than Sandra took him by the arm and
<br />
flipped him onto the ground.  There was a moment of silence--everybody was
<br />
shocked.  Then Williams began to laugh.  He got up and finished the
<br />
introductions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, for obvious reasons.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Actually, it's Miles, Miles Prower.  But everybody calls me Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  Tails was with me when Sandra caught us.  Nina, I met her in a
<br />
hover unit some time ago.  Sonic Hedgehog, he just plain doesn't like me.&quot;
<br />
He walked over to Sally's bed, &quot;And this is Princess Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess Sally Alicia of the House of Acorn.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever.  I just saved your life,&quot; he reminded her.  He still had three
<br />
more people to go.  &quot;Somebody else can introduce the rest of you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails immediately stepped forward.  &quot;This is Rotor and Bookshire
<br />
Draftwood.  And this is my brother, David Prower.  He's an android.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's good to meet all of you,&quot; David greeted the guests politely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams gave him an evil grin.  &quot;Android, huh?  As in...android.  Like
<br />
a big, walking computer.  Controlled by tiny, electrical impulses.  Just
<br />
waiting to be--Computer, scramble David!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David twitched a little, then fell to the floor.  Tails knelt beside him.
<br />
He shook David and asked him if he was all right, but nothing happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What have you done!?!&quot;  Bookshire didn't necessarily like it when
<br />
somebody ruins a lot of his hard work and effort.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, okay.  Sorry, but I haven't done that in a while.  Computer,
<br />
unscramble David.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got up, &quot;You can't just turn me off like a piece of equipment!  I am
<br />
a living being like anyone else!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, calm down.  Think of it this way: I knock you unconscious in such a
<br />
way that there is no permanent damage and I can wake you up at any time.&quot;
<br />
The world went black.  The next he knew, Williams was waking up to a bucket
<br />
of water in his face.  He could feel the bump on his head, realized what had
<br />
happened, and began laughing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can he DO that?&quot;  The more Sally got to know Williams, the more she
<br />
was confused by him, but, then again, doesn't everybody?  When she was well
<br />
enough to walk, Williams was placed in her now soaking wet bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I get it,&quot; said Williams.  &quot;Knocked unconscious, brought back with a
<br />
bucket of water, no permanent damage.  I get it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're not supposed to get it, it's not a joke.  You're supposed to know
<br />
how David felt.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess, I knew how he felt, I was fully prepared for this.  I'll
<br />
admit, however, that I didn't think anyone would actually do it.  Who
<br />
DID do it, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I did,&quot; Sonic stepped forward.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Adam already explained everything,&quot; continued Sally.  &quot;He said you would
<br />
get up and continue what you were doing as if nothing happened.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly.  Did he explain the creature?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but I have a question.  Adam said you opened the void and it came
<br />
out, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've been inside the void before, there are no giant insects in there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then my calculations were wrong.  Robotnik didn't have many details on
<br />
the void, I ended up doing most of the work myself.  There was a chance that
<br />
it wouldn't work when I opened it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where does yours lead?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know.  Maybe I'll have a chance to take you in some day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's not likely.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams sat up, &quot;Well, what's the plan?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't have one yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams groaned.  &quot;I have one, but you won't like it.&quot;  He got out of
<br />
bed and headed for the door, but when he arrived, he stopped, &quot;Almost
<br />
forgot.  Computer, deactivate all of Sally's nanites.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everybody was rounded up outside of the village, Williams gave
<br />
everybody an encouraging pep-talk.  &quot;There is a giant creature out there
<br />
that could easily kill any one of you.  I brought it here, so you don't have
<br />
to help me get rid of it if you don't want to.&quot;  Nobody left.  &quot;Since no one
<br />
has thought up a plan, I will present mine.  We save David's memory, David
<br />
jumps into the void, the creature follows, I close the void, you simply
<br />
build another android, everybody's happy.&quot;  There were a lot of objections
<br />
to this approach.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can't 'simply' build another android!&quot; stated Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You must have some kind of instructions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not the same android that they build me to be,&quot; said David.  &quot;I have
<br />
improved myself to become better than the original design.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good for you.  Then we save YOUR specifications for later reference.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just because he's an android doesn't mean we can sacrifice him to save
<br />
ourselves,&quot; defended Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Princess, do you have a better idea?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She did not.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Considering the circumstances,&quot; David spoke up, &quot;it would be best to
<br />
follow Williams' plan.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There, ya' see?  Now for the second part: we can't all go.  David
<br />
obviously has to go because he's going to lure it back whencesoever it
<br />
came.  I'm going because no one else can open the void, even if it is the
<br />
wrong one.  The rest--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going with you,&quot; insisted Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me too,&quot; volunteered Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If Tails is going,&quot; said Sonic, &quot;I'm going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope.  Too many people.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The rest of you can get to know each other better.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the necessary backups were made and the final good-byes said, the
<br />
group left for the Great Swamp.  For some odd reason or another the creature
<br />
had migrated there, its trail of destruction gave its new hiding place away.
<br />
They each said good-bye to David again and Adam went with him to the other
<br />
side of the creature.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; ordered Williams, &quot;open 'the void' twenty-five yards east of
<br />
the creature and close it as soon as the creature goes through it.&quot;  The
<br />
swirling helix again opened up.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was David's cue, &quot;So long, Adam.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, but Computer, scramble David.&quot;  He jumped out from behind the
<br />
tree, waved his hands frantically, and called out to the creature.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's he doing?&quot; asked Tails.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature noticed him and began chasing him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Adam!&quot; Williams tried to stop him, or at least get the creature away
<br />
from him.  &quot;You demented fool!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It worked.  The creature heard him and turned to start chasing him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams didn't expect that to happen.  &quot;Tails, run.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GO!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't leave you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing Williams could do at that point.  There was no place
<br />
for him to go, nothing for him to hide behind.  Even if he found a way to
<br />
escape, Tails was still there.  And the only thing between Tails and the
<br />
creature was him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This'll be fun,&quot; he said under his breath.  The creature slashed at him,
<br />
he took the full force of the blow.  One gash in his left arm, the other in
<br />
his leg, and being knocked ten feet away--he expected worse.  The creature
<br />
moved in for the kill.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a lot from Adam to regain the creature's full and undivided
<br />
attention, he ended up having to kick its back leg.  After that, the
<br />
creature simply followed him out of annoyance into the void.  That was it,
<br />
the crisis was over, and Adam was gone.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams?&quot; Tails ran over to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pain.  Pain is bad.&quot;  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Adam saved us, he took David's place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, that's what gets me.  To save us, all he had to do was come up
<br />
with a better plan than I did.  But he went and got himself killed.  There's
<br />
no way that I can top that.  I think he killed himself just to annoy me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams,&quot; Tails was surprised at him, &quot;your best friend is...gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he sighed.  &quot;There's something wrong, though.  Adam wouldn't just
<br />
jump into a void.&quot;  He slowly got up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Should you be walking?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be fine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you forgive me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I should've listened to you.  If I had just left when you said so, then
<br />
you could've...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Could have what?  Moved out of the way?  Yeah, right.  It doesn't matter
<br />
if you stayed, ran, or took my place, one of us was going to get hit, maybe
<br />
both.  Aren't you glad it was me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...no.  I mean, I don't want to see you hurt.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm trying to explain this to you.  Would you rather get your arm hacked
<br />
open, or have me, with my nanites that can fix almost anything, get my arm
<br />
hacked open?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He put his arm around Tails and gave him a type of half-hug.  &quot;Tails, I
<br />
could tell that when I first met you I was going to like you.  You are
<br />
extremely intelligent and need to work on your sense of humor, but that's
<br />
okay.  There are a LOT of things I can teach you, maybe you can visit me
<br />
sometime.  Just don't tell Sally you're going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe YOU can visit me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh I will.  Every once in a while, at the most unexpected time, I'll
<br />
drop by and say 'hello.'&quot;  He limped over to David's position, which was
<br />
still behind the tree.  &quot;Computer, what is wrong with David?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He has no recognizable command functions or interpretive data.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, unscramble David.&quot;  It did.  David got up and tried to deduce
<br />
exactly what went on whilst he was out.  &quot;Let's go,&quot; Williams started back
<br />
for Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as soon as he turned around, the void opened up again and Adam
<br />
popped out.  Immediately afterwards, it closed.  The trio ran (or limped as
<br />
the case may be) over to Adam, who was sweating and breathing heavily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They need more oxygen in their atmosphere,&quot; he panted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, that's what you get for being heroic,&quot; commented Williams.  He
<br />
helped Adam up and they started back for Knothole.  &quot;I nearly get my leg
<br />
lopped off after I try to save you, and you nearly suffocate after you save
<br />
us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't care--I won!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Won what?&quot; asked Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We had a...bet going.  Whoever could get rid of the creature was
<br />
declared the winner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There was nothing tangible at stake,&quot; added Williams.  &quot;It was just a
<br />
matter of reputation.  Something you can check off on your 'things-to-do'
<br />
list.  Saved planet, check.  How did you get back, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When you were unconscious I took your void programs.  I would never
<br />
jump into a void with no way to get back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How was it in there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nice place to visit.  I'm never going there again.  Promise me one
<br />
thing, Williams, don't ever open it again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's a problem.  See, I told the princess I'd take her in.  And Tails
<br />
might want to go.  Then I'd have to show Kristen also.  Maybe we could set
<br />
up an attraction...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails!&quot; Nina ran up to meet him.  They embraced, &quot;Why is David here?
<br />
Did the plan work?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's hard to explain.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams' wounds had healed a bit, but were still quite noticeable.
<br />
Kristen saw the torn clothing, missing scales, and dried blood and wanted to
<br />
know what happened.  He explained everything, including why David was still
<br />
with them.  &quot;And now, Princess, we will be on our way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; Tails stopped him.  &quot;Aunt Sally, can't they stay here just one
<br />
more day?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had to think for a minute.  &quot;Ultimately, it's not my decision to
<br />
make.  You'll have to ask Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took some convincing from Tails and Nina, even Bookshire put in a good
<br />
word for them.  Maybe it was because Adam saved the planet, maybe it was
<br />
because Williams saved the princess, maybe even because Williams was
<br />
injured.  In the end, Sonic let them stay for twenty-four more hours, but no
<br />
longer.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End...
<br />
