<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let's start - Jeffrey Pegnato mentioned a
<br />
couple of things I'd like to put my commentary on.  1)
<br />
The destruction of everything Robotnik built - sorry,
<br />
guy, but they got the headquarters, and maybe a few
<br />
buildings around it, and they think they got Robo.
<br />
Probably squashed a lot of swatbots in the process.
<br />
Unfortunately, 'bots still roll off the assembly line,
<br />
as loyal roboticized workers continue to do their jobs.
<br />
Unless the freedom fighters move fast, they'll be
<br />
waiting for Snively when he gets back to town.  If they
<br />
hadn't actually gotten Robo, at least temporarily, it
<br />
would be nothing more than a major annoyance to him.
<br />
2) Sally the vixen?  Actually... anybody taken a good
<br />
look at her father?  That's a fox tail - and nothing
<br />
like her little ground squirrel appendage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bluth!  I'll just leave it that I felt he brutally
<br />
mutilated the book's story, but everything else was
<br />
great.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artwork!  I have to say that Scott Shaw's is my
<br />
favorite from what I've seen of the comic, but really
<br />
as far as I know all I've seen him do is that Tails
<br />
story.  On the other hand, Tails's expressions in that
<br />
are my favorite moments in the entire comic run, except
<br />
possibly for some of the stuff being set up in Princess
<br />
Sally.  Shaw doesn't have the precision that makes
<br />
Sonic actually look GOOD on the cartoon, but his work
<br />
is very cute, and his expressions are... well,
<br />
expressive!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to finish Robo - actually, I always figured
<br />
that when the freedom fighters figured they actually
<br />
had enough of a chance to pick up the pieces afterwards
<br />
to actually go after him, he'd be roboticized in the
<br />
fight - and then, since if anybody's got enough
<br />
willpower to keep going aftwards it's him, he'd be
<br />
smashed, although perhaps not to the point of
<br />
irreparability, at least to helplessness.  It's how I'd
<br />
do it, and I am pleasantly surprised to find that they
<br />
frequently take the more artistic way for their
<br />
storylines.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's About It,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mouse
