Wow! 
<br />

<br />
I thought this was a great story!  Every interresting plot twist and character 
<br />
development was interresting as well as entertaining.  I saved all the 
<br />
chapters a while ago to read at some later date...when I recieved the ending 
<br />
chapters today,
<br />
I decided I should probably start reading. :)  But I didn't expect to read 
<br />
the whole
<br />
thing in one sitting!  I just couldn't stop - very compelling!  
<br />

<br />
Story spoilers ahead:
<br />

<br />
I really liked the notion of a twin sister &amp; dividing the royal 
<br />
family...that whole sequence of events provides a great explanation for the 
<br />
show (as well as Sonic being an orphan)  
<br />
All of that sequence also worked well within the story &amp; within the thoughts 
<br />
and feelings of the individual characters.   I thought that was the story's 
<br />
best achievement...A good balance between the stoyline and emotional 
<br />
reaction of the characters.   
<br />

<br />
I liked the ending...(I thought it was a little predictable, but good just 
<br />
the same)
<br />

<br />
Comments on the VERY ending...
<br />
After reading your WARNING message, I  was wondering what strange or perverse
<br />
ramblings I would encounter, but when I read about Bunnie + Sandy...well...I
<br />
laughed.  Not because I was dissapointed, but because it doesn't make much sense
<br />
to me in this story.  The way the story was written, every emotion, action, 
<br />
and event
<br />
was clearly explained  or foreshadowed in some way...but this little event 
<br />
came clear
<br />
out of the blue with no explanation or warning!  I'm not sure it's an 
<br />
appropriate ending
<br />
to this story...I mean, it seems to me this should have been at most a 
<br />
sub-plot within the story or another story all together.  (Id Est, This was 
<br />
the last thing I expected to be reading in a story focusing on Sally, her 
<br />
mysterious sister, and her
<br />
long-lost mother)  But then again, I didn't write it! ;)
<br />

<br />
P.S. Great job, Dan!
