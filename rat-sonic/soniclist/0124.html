<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The snow lay thick on the ground.  Deep in the Diamond Mountains, a 
<br />
rebel village lay in total ruin.  Huts had been destroyed, fires burned in 
<br />
the remains of homes.  Blast marks left by powerful laser rifles scorched 
<br />
the surrounding mountains, and a few of the surrounding trees had either 
<br />
been destroyed, or were burning.  Among all the destruction, a lone shuttle 
<br />
sat on its own with a lone passenger inside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commander Packbell sat in front of his computer in the shuttle 
<br />
writing his report.  It had been about four hours since the last of the 
<br />
prisoner transports had departed.  Whenever he successfully located and 
<br />
overpowered a group of freedom fighters, he always stayed around for a while 
<br />
writing the report that would be turned in at Central Command.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raid had gone very well.  His forces charged in, eliminated the 
<br />
resistance and captured the survivors.  They had managed to capture 103 
<br />
freedom fighters this time around.  That brought Packbell's personal total 
<br />
to 613 captured freedom fighters.  The losses had been minimal, ten bots on 
<br />
his side and fifteen rebels on the other side.  As soon as he finished his 
<br />
report, he stood up and went outside to survey all the damage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything was in ruin.  As he strode through the remains, he came 
<br />
across a hut that had somehow managed to stay standing.  Upon entering, he 
<br />
found the inside to be in utter chaos.  Apparently the result of rebels 
<br />
scattering in fear as Swat-bots busted in.  As he looked about, he noticed 
<br />
something lying on the floor in the corner.  Packbell bent down and examined 
<br />
it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas tree, he thought to himself.  He had never understood the 
<br />
concept of Christmas.  The very idea had appeared to him to be absolutely 
<br />
pointless.  He had judged the holiday to be inefficient.  Nothing important 
<br />
ever got done during this time.  What was the point of wasting time giving 
<br />
gifts when one could be working to better himself like Packbell did.  
<br />
Granted, Packbell did hang around the Command Center often, doing nothing, 
<br />
but he didn't call that wasting time, he called that waiting for orders.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; he said, standing &quot;no Christmas for these rebels.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pulled his laser pistol and fried the tree into ashes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the shuttle, Packbell headed back to Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, deep in the great forest, the freedom fighters of 
<br />
Knothole where celebrating the season.  Everywhere one looked, there were 
<br />
signs of the Christmas spirit. Sonic and Tails were having snowball fights, 
<br />
Bookshire was helping Sally decorate the huts, Antoine was trying to decide 
<br />
what to give the Princess for Christmas, and Dulci and Rotor were busy 
<br />
putting up a hundred foot Christmas Tree in the center of Knothole.  Dulci 
<br />
would move it into position while Rotor calculated the optimum angle in 
<br />
which the tree should be positioned so that it wouldn't fall down in case of 
<br />
a snow storm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the tree had been set, all the freedom fighters gathered around 
<br />
to decorate it.  the decoration of the tree was something the freedom 
<br />
fighters looked forward to every year, and, as with all the years before, 
<br />
when the decoration was complete, Tails would fly up to the top and place 
<br />
the star on top of the tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ceremony had gone well.  Afterwards, Sally, Rotor and Tails went 
<br />
over to help Bookshire decorate his tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know,&quot; remarked Bookshire as they came in &quot;I don't think the 
<br />
tree has ever looked better.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;we did a real good job on it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How would you all like something to drink?&quot; said Bookshire &quot;I've 
<br />
got freshly made eggnog in the fridge.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great!&quot; said Rotor and Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No thanks,&quot; said Sally &quot;Eggnog is real fattening.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Relax, Sal,&quot; replied Bookshire &quot;It's totally low in fat and 
<br />
cholesterol.  I made it without any egg yolks; only egg whites.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sally &quot;I suppose.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; said Bookshire as he went into the kitchen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; said Rotor &quot;What are you two asking Santa for for Christmas?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Peace and good will,&quot; said Sally &quot;I ask for it every year.  One 
<br />
of these years I'm sure my request will be granted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm asking for some new running shoes,&quot; said Tails &quot;The ones I 
<br />
have are wearing out.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sounds good,&quot; said Bookshire as he returned with four cups of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eggnog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After decorating the tree they all went to bed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, back in Robotropolis, Packbell was pacing the hallways, 
<br />
deep in thought.  He had decided to get Robotnik something close to a 
<br />
Christmas present in order to better understand what the big deal was.  If 
<br />
he was ever going to overthrow Robotnik, he decided, it would be nice to 
<br />
know about these things.  However, he had encountered two problems: (1) how 
<br />
to give the gift without Robotnik suspecting it was a present and (2) what 
<br />
to get him.  He stopped in the hallway a thought for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does Robotnik want more than anything in the world?&quot; he asked 
<br />
himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments an evil smile spread across his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The location of Knothole Village,&quot; he answered simply.  It would be 
<br />
a tall order, but Packbell was confident that he knew who could find out for 
<br />
him.  Turning on his heel, he walked back to the docking platform to get a 
<br />
shuttle.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's shuttle flew silently through the dark of night.  After a 
<br />
time, it came to rest at the edge of the Great Swamp.  After leaving the 
<br />
shuttle, Packbell walked into the swamp.  He took various routes, making 
<br />
several turns before he arrived at his destination.  He entered a small 
<br />
clearing, stood in the center, and waited.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, well, well, its only been a week,&quot; said a voice, suddenly 
<br />
&quot;does the high a mighty Packbell need my assistance again?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell was not impressed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knock it off, Sandra,&quot; he said into the darkness &quot;You should know 
<br />
by now that your mysterious front doesn't impress me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well,&quot; said Sandra &quot;what can I do for you this time?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very simple, really.  I would like the location of Knothole 
<br />
Village,&quot; said Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knothole?  Isn't that where Princess Sally hides out?&quot; asked Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Correct,&quot; replied Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A tough assignment,&quot; said Sandra &quot;You understand that you are 
<br />
asking me to betray a member of the royal family.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; said Packbell &quot;but I don't see a problem.  Unless, you 
<br />
are actually loyal the her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course not!&quot; snapped Sandra &quot;I'm loyal to no one but myself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then you'll do it?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll have to think about it,&quot; replied Sandra &quot;What would you give me if I gave you this information?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; replied Sandra &quot;in that case, get me the Crown Jewels of 
<br />
Mobius and I'll think about it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Done,&quot; said Packbell.   As he turned to leave, he heard a rustling 
<br />
in the bushes to his right as Sandra sprinted off into the swamp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One day,&quot; he thought &quot;I'll find out what she really looks like.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra Nightweaver sprinted through the Great Swamp as a breakneck 
<br />
pace.  Her black fur blended with the night so as to make her virtually 
<br />
invisible.  Soon she arrived at her hideout.  She sat down at her desk and 
<br />
opened a map of The Great Forest.  It was going to be tricky, but she was 
<br />
confident she would pull it off.  She gathered up a few things and departed 
<br />
for The Great Forest.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Christmas came ever closer, so did the spirit of Christmas come 
<br />
with it.  The Christmas celebration in Knothole was in full swing. On top 
<br />
of everything else, Bookshire had managed to locate a database on his 
<br />
computer that had some Christmas music in it by a little known group called 
<br />
Mannheim Steamroller.  It was a unique kind of instrumental music that had 
<br />
been done entirely with synthesizers as well as traditional instruments.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am a little concerned,&quot; Sally was saying to Sonic as they walked 
<br />
along.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about?&quot;  asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; she said &quot;What if Robotnik tries something that will ruin 
<br />
the magic of the season.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then I'll go bust it up like I always do.&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You really think you could handle anything?&quot; asked Sally as they 
<br />
stopped walking for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh sure,&quot; replied Sonic &quot;I can handle anything.  I'm fully 
<br />
qualified.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh really,&quot; said Sally laughing a little bit &quot;And what are your 
<br />
qualifications?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm fast, determined, way past cool, and sneaky,&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sneaky, huh, &quot; said Sally &quot;Prove it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Easy,&quot; said Sonic &quot;look up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked up a saw a sprig of mistletoe that Sonic had hung up 
<br />
above where they were standing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot;  said Sonic &quot;what do ya' say!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Sally, pretending to hesitate &quot;I suppose.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two embraced and, after a moment gazing into each others eyes, 
<br />
they engaged in a kiss.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, a dark figure moved though the surrounding forest.  
<br />
Sandra Nightweaver had been searching for three days, and now she had found 
<br />
them.   She moved closer to Knothole to get a better look at it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire was sitting in front of his computer playing a video game 
<br />
when, suddenly, a quiet alarm went off.  Completely startled, Bookshire 
<br />
fell back off of his chair.  Standing, he moved over to another monitor 
<br />
and turned off the alarm.  He examined the  monitor carefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like we have company,&quot; he said to himself.  Quickly grabbing 
<br />
his coat and cane,  he headed out into the night.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra concealed herself behind some bushes on the fringes of 
<br />
Knothole.  After examining the place for a while, she stood carefully and 
<br />
ran from the village.  Suddenly, someone appeared before her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And just where do you think you're going?&quot; asked Bookshire, 
<br />
stepping into the moon light.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without answering, Sandra charged forward, intent on escape.  As 
<br />
she passed by Bookshire, he quickly stuck out his cane, catching her legs.  
<br />
Sandra tripped and fell face first into the snow with such force that it 
<br />
knocked her out.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra didn't come around until the next morning.  When she did, 
<br />
she found herself in a bed with Rotor, Sally, Sonic and Bookshire standing 
<br />
over her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few moments of tense silence Sonic spoke.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who are you,&quot; he asked simply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No one you need to know about,&quot; replied Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't give us that,&quot; said Sally &quot;You're Sandra Nightweaver aren't 
<br />
you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandra said nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My father told me about you on more than one occasion,&quot; said Sally 
<br />
&quot;Breaking and entering, theft, espionage.  I believe those have been you're 
<br />
crimes.  I believe that you also tried to rip off the royal treasury at one 
<br />
point didn't you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, your highness, it looks like you've got me cold,&quot; said Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why are you here,&quot; asked Rotor.        
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just gathering a little information,&quot; she replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're planning to sell us out to Robotnik aren't you,&quot; said Sally 
<br />
&quot;I've got half a mind to arrest you for treason right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go ahead,&quot; said Sandra, smiling &quot;you can't keep me here.  Your 
<br />
father's high tech prisons couldn't hold me and I don't think whatever you 
<br />
have now can either.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She's right you know,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;Know matter what we do, 
<br />
she'll probably escape somehow.  So, I suppose the real question is what 
<br />
will she do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you really going to sell us out, Sandra?&quot; asked Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm still thinking about it,&quot; replied Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said Sonic &quot;Well, think about this.  If you sell us out 
<br />
we'll make sure every freedom fighter on the planet hears of your betrayal.  
<br />
You'll never be welcome anywhere ever again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps,&quot; replied Sandra &quot;However, aside from that not happening, 
<br />
what else would you offer me to keep my mouth shut.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll tell you what,&quot; said Sally &quot;You keep our location a secret 
<br />
and I'll consider granting you a full pardon at the end of the war.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;However, your winning the war is not a sure thing,&quot; said Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps, but this a far better deal than anything Robotnik would 
<br />
give you if you were talking to him instead of me,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like I said before, I'm still thinking about it,&quot; Sandra replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As you wish,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group left her alone, and, later that evening, she slipped 
<br />
unnoticed from the village.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Packbell was walking through the halls of the central 
<br />
command center, feeling so pleased that he was going to get the location of 
<br />
Knothole that he couldn't resist whispering a short tune he invented.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jingle bells, 'buttnik smells
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively is a geek
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compared to me, its plain to see
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they're idiots of the week!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed a little as he finished and headed for the docking bay 
<br />
to go meet Sandra.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's shuttle landed at the edge of the Great Swamp once again, 
<br />
and once again he took the same route to the same clearing to see what 
<br />
Sandra had to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandra,&quot; he called out into the darkness.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm here,&quot; came the reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you get the information I requested?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes,&quot; replied Sandra &quot;I suppose you want it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I kind of had that in mind,&quot; said Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause.  Sandra sat in her hiding place trying to 
<br />
make up her mind.  Finally, she reached a decision.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Packbell &quot;let's have it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Actually,&quot; said Sandra &quot;I don't think I'll tell you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?!&quot; exclaimed Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I told you I was still thinking about it, and I've decided that, 
<br />
when it comes down to it, I'm not going to betray a member of the royal 
<br />
family,&quot; announced Sandra.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't believe this!&quot; exclaimed Packbell as he got angry &quot;You know, 
<br />
Sandra, if you were a Swat-bot standing in front of me, I'd blast you into 
<br />
scrap metal so fast you wouldn't have time to realize what had happened!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned and stormed out of the clearing.  Suddenly, he stopped 
<br />
and turned back one last time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Know this, Sandra Nightweaver,&quot; he called out &quot;from now on you are 
<br />
a freedom fighter to me, and if you I ever get my hands on you, you will be 
<br />
treated as such!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And proud of it!&quot; called Sandra as she sprinted off into the swamp.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell stood there for a few moments clenching his fists, and 
<br />
wishing he had something to strangle.  After a moment he calmed down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Christmas sucks,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell turned and walked back to the shuttle.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Christmas Eve arrived and a sort of pleasant 
<br />
peace settled over Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't the stars look wonderful,&quot; remarked Sally as she and sonic 
<br />
walked down the path.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They sure do,&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think Sandra turned us in?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doubtful,&quot; said Bookshire walking up behind them &quot;Despite all the 
<br />
claims she's made at being a loner, she still needs some support from the 
<br />
rest of us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think we'll ever see her again?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who can say,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;in this crazy war, anything's 
<br />
possible.  Well, good night you two.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire turned and walked toward his house.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, Bookshire's right,&quot; said Sonic &quot;I don't think she did it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're probably right, Sonic,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christmas Eve slowly slipped away...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning was a time for celebration. The entire morning was 
<br />
spent opening presents followed by a huge feast.  Everyone got something 
<br />
they had asked for.  The only thing that had not come was global peace and 
<br />
good will.  However, the important thing was the, in the heart of every 
<br />
freedom fighter was the idea, the belief, that one day soon, they would be 
<br />
able to celebrate without having to worry if they would make it to the next 
<br />
year.  They would finally have what they fought so hard for year round... 
<br />
freedom.
<br />

<br />
THE END
<br />

<br />
This is Bookshire sending a message to all of you in cyberspace, to 
<br />
everyone in the country and all over the world, to everyone in this 
<br />
universe and where ever life exists... Merry Christmas.
<br />
