I'd also like to say it wasn't anyone's fault that I shut down the list. I'm
<br />
not mad at anyone (except for that jerk that posted all those annoying posts
<br />
who I kicked off).
<br />
So no need to write me with an apology. 
<br />

<br />
On a seperate note......
<br />

<br />
Use alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog
<br />
This brings up something I should meantion that I am aware of. Not everyone
<br />
gets the sonic newsgroup. But it is at a lot of places.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are others to know when new stories are added? And, where are we to direct

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the writers and the person running the web page can keep in touch.
</em><br />

<br />
bookshire (bookshire_at_rat.org) does maintain a fanfic page, and stories have
<br />
always gone to him. 
<br />
As far as a network for keeping in touch with the guy that runs the web 
<br />
page, talk to bookshire.
<br />

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;After thinking about it more, I think I'd like to shut the sonic list down.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Isn't that a bit overreacting?
</em><br />

<br />
To what? This isn't a reflex action to an event. This is me thinking long and
<br />
hard about do I really want to continue to spend the time maintaining the
<br />
list, and devoting resources on my server for it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I'll shut it down this weekend, so you all have a week to say your goodbyes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;or whatever.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will list-admin Erich be back by then?  But if it's your machine/account,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess it doesn't matter...
</em><br />

<br />
I don't know what his status is. And it's not his decision anyway.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Those are my reasons, and this is not open for debate.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The main things I _don't_ want to lose are Ken Penders' inputs as a Sonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; writer/insider and Dan Drazen's reviews of the comics (even if he _was_ 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; apparently the straw that broke your back just by posting a &quot;thanks&quot; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comment to the list instead of taking it to e-mail...)
</em><br />

<br />
Not really. Ken was one of the more informative posters. I've always enjoyed
<br />
his posts. The &quot;thanks&quot; post was an exception, and was annoying, but
<br />
certainly didn't have anything to do with me shutting down the list. 
<br />

<br />
It was not anyone's fault, this is just me. So if someone should be blamed,
<br />
blame me. This is my server, and I'm pulling the plug on the mailing list. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;And I do encourage you to use the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog newsgroup. If your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;internet provider does not carry it, tell them to! It's very easy to add
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;newsgroups, so they have no excuse. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Except when they're GE and they decide to drop 90+% of the alt.* traffic 
</em><br />

<br />
You're not alone. Many servers don't carry alt.fan.*, in which case no amount
<br />
of begging will help. I was thinking of the ISP I work for when I said that.
<br />
All a customer has to do is ask to get a newsgroup added to our server.  But
<br />
in an environment where they ban a whole news hierarchy (did I spell that
<br />
right?), there isn't much you can do about it. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe what I'll do is maintain my original Sonic list and expand it to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; include the &quot;quality&quot; regulars from this list; maybe somebody else will 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; want to restart it up as a regular mailing list again sometime...
</em><br />

<br />
That could be cool, if done right.
<br />
In case anyone is curious, there are 109 members of the main list, and 5 
<br />
people on the digest version.
