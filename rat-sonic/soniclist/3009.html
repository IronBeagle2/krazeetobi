Several days back , I posted an &quot;advertisement&quot; on this list for my fan-fiction
<br />
stories . This is just a small update . 
<br />

<br />
This is the number of requests I have recieved to date :
<br />

<br />
Temporal Trouble : 5
<br />
Of Foxes and Sorcery (3 parts) : 6
<br />
As the Wheel Turns : 5
<br />

<br />
For those who prefer to download it from the WWW , read here , then skip the
<br />
section on e-mails .
<br />
A day or two ago , I recieved an offer from the person known as Commander
<br />
Sonic Data ( I don't know his/her real name) . He/She offered to upload my
<br />
fan-fic to his/her webpage , so that people wouldn't have to contact me directly
<br />
for these stories (since rat.org won't be updated real soon...) . Anyway ,
<br />
he/she has kept his/her word and all five of my fan-fic stories are now
<br />
available at the Freedom Fighters Command Central (I think that's the name..)
<br />
The URL is <a href="HTTP://INET.UNI-C.DK/~SONICCSD/">HTTP://INET.UNI-C.DK/~SONICCSD/</a> . Look in the Gallery section .
<br />
Many , many thanks to Commander Sonic Data for the offer .
<br />

<br />
REMEMBER to let me know what you think of my fan-fic . Thanx .
<br />

<br />
For those of you who want to recieve the fan-fic via e-mail , read below .
<br />
Since I have to send the stories to you manually , and I only check my mail
<br />
once a day , all requests should be processed within 36 hours from the time you
<br />
sent the request . If this time has elasped and you still haven't recieved it , 
<br />
it probably means that the request got lost (Check the address you sent it to ,
<br />
was it vicl_at_pacific.net.sg ? ) , or something equally nasty . So , if you
<br />
haven't heard back from me , do send another letter my way , and I'll send you
<br />
your request . 
<br />

<br />
If you have no idea what I'm talking about , chances are that you missed my
<br />
earlier post , so for those in the dark , there's a description of my fan-fic
<br />
below . Enjoy .

<br />
Read the stuff below , and if any of the stories catch your interest and if you
<br />
don't want to wait till May to get them , e-mail me at vicl_at_pacific.net.sg for
<br />
a copy , which you will receive within a day or two from the time you contacted
<br />
me .
<br />

<br />

<br />
The following work is entirely original , to the best of my knowledge . As I've
<br />
said , I only recently started in this stuff , so people might have done this
<br />
before without me knowing ...
<br />

<br />
# 1  :  Temporal Trouble
<br />

<br />
David Prower ( Tails' cybernetic brother created by fanfic author Shawn Wolski )
<br />
is apparently lost during a freak accident , and Rotor has to find him . Sonic
<br />
admits his &quot;dislike&quot; for the cyberfox .
<br />

<br />
Personal Note : I can't really go into detail for this story , since elaborating
<br />
further would really spoil it .
<br />

<br />
# 2  :  Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part One
<br />

<br />
This story would probably fit in the Alternate Sonic Universes section of the
<br />
Sonic web page ( in the category &quot;Bloodlines&quot; is in )
<br />

<br />
This story revolves around Tails . The two tailed fox is fed up with the way the
<br />
Freedom Fighters treat him like a child . That however is about to change .
<br />
While on a long walk , comtemplating on that fact , Tails' loses his way , is
<br />
confronted and nearly killed by a wild animal , but is saved just in time by a
<br />
mysterious creature , who upon finding out who Tails is , leads him to meet
<br />
a person Tails never thought still existed . That person leaves Tails a legacy
<br />
the fox had never even dreamt of ....
<br />
Now with a devastating power backing Tails , the fox loses control of himself
<br />
temporarily , due to unforseen circumstances . During that time , Tails creates
<br />
big problems for Snively , who is now intent on catching and killing Tails ....
<br />

<br />
This is just a short description which does not cover all the parts of the 
<br />
story . 
<br />

<br />
# 3  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Two
<br />

<br />
This part of the story covers part of Tails' attempt at mastering his &quot;gift&quot; ,
<br />
with aid from unexpected sources . 
<br />

<br />
This part is rather short , so I can't go into detail 
<br />

<br />
# 4  : Of Foxes and Sorcery - Part Three
<br />

<br />
This concludes the &quot;Of Foxes and Sorcery&quot; story . Snively goes into full swing
<br />
to capture Tails , causing dire side effects in the process . Though his 
<br />
original plan fails , circumstances created by the failure leaves room for a
<br />
secondary plan for Snively to capture the menace . Tails is eventually lured
<br />
to Robotropolis , due to circumstances beyond his control ... lured to the
<br />
trap that Snively has prepared for him .
<br />

<br />
This story had several references to violence ( not that much ) , and may not
<br />
agree with everyone . In my opinion , the story might also be considered 
<br />
slightly depressing .... but you decide for yourself .
<br />

<br />
# 5  : As the Wheel Turns
<br />

<br />
This story is set in the future , ten years after Snively's defeat . Mobius
<br />
is once again peaceful , but an important decision that its rulers have to make
<br />
might just have dire consequences ....
<br />

<br />
Like &quot;Temporal Trouble&quot; , I cannot reveal too much about this story . It is
<br />
however , in my opinion , quite an ok one ....
<br />

<br />
So , e-mail me if the stories interest you . The longest is Of Foxes and
<br />
Sorcery Part III ( about 8 pages ) , the shortest is Part II of the same story
<br />
( 2 pages ) .
<br />

<br />
Happy reading ! 
<br />
