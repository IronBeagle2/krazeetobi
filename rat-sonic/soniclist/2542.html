Too many nested messages... let me see if I can keep em straight...

</em><br />

<br />
I liked Sonic the first time I saw the game in a store display.  The thing
<br />
I liked about Sonic was how fast the game could be.  Sonic didn't plod
<br />
along like UberMario did.
<br />

<br />
I didn't get a Genesis until a few years later when I felt I could afford
<br />
one...  Sega also had a special [Get a Genesis w/ Sonic and get Sonic 2 at
<br />
no extra cost]. 
<br />

<br />
I first heard about and saw the cartoon at the Chicago Consumer
<br />
Electronics Show a few months before it was on TV [I didn't watch much of
<br />
it at the show because the sound wasn't loud enough and there was lots to
<br />
see and time was running out]. 
<br />

<br />
I wasn't expecting too much of it because so many shows based on toys or
<br />
games were so pitiful [&quot;Potato Head Kids&quot; was possibly the WORST of the
<br />
bunch... anyone else see that unwatchable peice of garbage?  Often I like
<br />
an occasional dumb and stupid show on TV once in a while but THAT show
<br />
couldn't even suck in new and interesting ways]. 
<br />

<br />
I was pleasently mistaken about the Sonic Cartoon.  I liked Sonic before,
<br />
but I liked him much more when the cartoon came out.
<br />

<br />
I was disappointed that so few episodes were made (ABC didn't help matters
<br />
by showing the cartoon twice each saturday... 7 weeks and you're already
<br />
in reruns).  I stopped watching it after a few months since I had all the
<br />
episodes on tape (well... all except one it turned out)  (I learned about
<br />
the second season a few months after it had started airing).
<br />

<br />
Anyway... Enough of that:
<br />

Fight games in general are a 'rage'.  You go to video game arcades and more
<br />
than half the new games are fight games it seems.
<br />

<br />
I've never been able to get into games like that though.  If I wanted to 
<br />
learn thousands of different stimulus-response reactions, then I'd learn
<br />
a REAL martial art as opposed to faking one in a game...  For games... 
<br />
just gimme something I can BLOW UP!

<br />
Only a SLIM chance for Virtua Sonic?  How come it seems that half of Sega's
<br />
games don't make it to the US?  No wonder I keep hearing that
<br />
Sega's Saturn isn't doing all that well (Compared to PlayStation).  
<br />

<br />
What's this about a Sonic Fighting game?  How can you make Sonic a 
<br />
fighting game?!  I thought people were confusing Virtua Sonic with a
<br />
'Sonic Fighting Game' but now you're saying they're two separate entities?
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
One thing which has always given me some hope for Sonic though... You
<br />
still see new products featuring the spiny blue guy (e.g. Sonic Pasta... 
<br />
Sonic watch offer on Quaker Oatmeal... Sonic books) If they're phasing
<br />
Sonic out, why would they bother (I know it takes months to plan these
<br />
deals out but the last big Sonic game was out over a YEAR ago?  It almost
<br />
sounds like they're paving the way for a comeback (or maybe that's just 
<br />
wishful thinking)).
