I saw this again today, and thought I'd offer my comments:
<br />

<br />
1.  Did Robotnik want to _control_ the planet, or _destroy_ it with
<br />
those pods?
<br />

<br />
2.  One scene showed the pods as metal frames which were then dipped in
<br />
some evil goop, then emerged as fully complete mechanisms.  Huh?
<br />

<br />
3.  A little _too_ convenient how the other teams were all captured...
<br />

<br />
4.  When S&amp;S first joined the stones, I was kind of hoping for a &quot;deus
<br />
ex machina&quot; ending like that of &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot;, but it didn't
<br />
quite make it (although it was still nice).  It ended up reminding me
<br />
more of the end of &quot;Animalympics&quot; - &quot;I can run forever if we can run
<br />
together!&quot;
<br />

<br />
5.  So how long will that charge from the stones last, anyway?  :^)
<br />
(And what happened to them?)
<br />

<br />
6.  I _still_ can't believe it's been cancelled :^(

OK, here are a couple:
<br />

<br />
#22 [May 1995]
<br />

<br />
&quot;The Return&quot;, written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &amp; Harvey M.
<br />

<br />
The story opens on S&amp;S MWC (Sonic &amp; Sally, Married With Children), but
<br />
this turns out to be the (supposedly) alternate Mobius seen in the &quot;In
<br />
Your Face Special #1&quot;.  S&amp;S are out with the kids one day when an
<br />
apparition of Robotnik appears then vanishes.  We then cut to a
<br />
satellite where Robotnik materializes and finds himself facing a video
<br />
image of a roboticized version of himself: on this Mobius, Robotnik
<br />
roboticized himself but still lost the &quot;final battle&quot; and uploaded his
<br />
mind to a satellite he had been constructing.  Unfortunately it wasn't
<br />
complete so all he can do is wait for his sytems to run down.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Our&quot; Robotnik assures him he will &quot;evolve to the next level&quot; (huh?)
<br />
and gets him to send him back to the &quot;real&quot; Mobius where it turns out
<br />
Snively has accidentally activated another version of Doomsday where
<br />
Robotnik would have Mobius destroyed if he ever lost.  (Note that in
<br />
the resulting battle Antoine exclaims &quot;Mon Dieu!&quot; - such language in a
<br />
children's comic...)  Robotnik arrives back just in time to shut down
<br />
&quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; mainly to keep the robots from destroying the
<br />
place and leaving him nothing to rule, but he also uses this as a
<br />
chance to shake up Sonic by noting that Sonic owes his life to
<br />
Robotnik.  At the end both sides realize they're at yet another
<br />
stalemate and the battle will continue another day...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tails' Knighttime Story!&quot;, written by Angelo Decesare, art by Dave
<br />
Manak &amp; John Dagastino
<br />

<br />
Tails is grumbling about Sonic's life being &quot;non-stop fun and
<br />
excitement&quot; while he &quot;mostly stay[s] here and get[s] &quot;baby-sat&quot;&quot;.
<br />
Sally tells him a story with Sonic as a knight and Tails as his page to
<br />
illustrate the saying &quot;never wish to be someone else until you have
<br />
fought a battle in his armor&quot;, but it doesn't quite work - Tails gets
<br />
the idea to borrow Sonic's sneakers so he can &quot;really play Sonic&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Funny scene in the story Sally tells Tails:  &quot;and he watched as Sir
<br />
Runalot won the hearts of the fairest maidens on Mobius!&quot; - shows Sonic
<br />
in knight's armor on a moonlit bench holding Sally's hand (dressed in
<br />
maiden's costume) saying to Tails in page's clothes: &quot;Yo!  How about
<br />
some privacy?&quot;  Tails gets an embarrassed grin and replies &quot;Sorry,
<br />
boss!&quot;, with beads of sweat running down his forehead... :^)
<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
<br />

<br />
&quot;Deadliest of the Species!&quot;, written by Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken
<br />
Penders, Art by Art Mawhinney and Rich Koslowski.
<br />

<br />
Opens with a nice spash page summarizing the struggle so far and
<br />
describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is renowned for his
<br />
military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's meeting
<br />
Geoffrey St. John (a skunk) in StH #20.
<br />

<br />
Sally &amp; Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility
<br />
and manage to beat them off and exchange some banter in the process (I
<br />
can't call it friendly, but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
<br />
then head back to the camp where some young trainee-freedom fighters
<br />
are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for enemies and jumps
<br />
the pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally.  However, this
<br />
establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues
<br />
all issue.
<br />

<br />
The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and after
<br />
battling SWATbots and ORB-bots, manages to destroy it.  During the
<br />
battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life, but he still doesn't trust him.
<br />
And maybe with good reason, since that night, when everybody else is
<br />
asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind
<br />
of building and descends into its basement, where he says to a figure
<br />
sleeping in a glass case: &quot;Soon, m'luv... soon!&quot;  The sleeping figure
<br />
is seen to be Sally???
<br />

<br />
This issue also contains a some fan art; two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie
<br />
(both NBD), and another one of Sally as a dominatrix (by a 13-year-old,
<br />
no less - sheesh...)
<br />

<br />
I _do_ like the direction the comic's going; if it keeps up, it will be
<br />
(almost) as good as having the show...
<br />
