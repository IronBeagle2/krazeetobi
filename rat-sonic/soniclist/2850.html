<br />
#35  [June 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ring of Truth,&quot; (in 3 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story starts out in total game mode, with Sonic being
<br />
chased by Robotnik and losing his accumulated power rings along
<br />
the way (a situation to which I can, unfortunately, relate). 
<br />
While dodging Robotnik's maceball he grabs at a ring that causes
<br />
him to disappear.  Robotnik's onboard computer has been keeping
<br />
count of the number of rings Sonic has grabbed in the course of a
<br />
lifetime [how convenient!  Maybe Robotnik can find honest work as
<br />
a baseball statistician!] and it turns out that was the
<br />
1,000,000,000th power ring.  Never mind that, in the animated
<br />
series, Sonic can only access one ring a day.  We're dealing with
<br />
some different realities here.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic finds himself transported into another dimension,
<br />
where dwell the Ancient Walkers.  He is told that it is his
<br />
billionth ring and that his reward will be...knowledge.  Or a
<br />
copy of the home game, it depends.  Our hero finds himself
<br />
falling toward a green sea.  Turns out it's green because it's
<br />
made up, not of water, but of chaos emeralds.  The billionth
<br />
ring, following him around like a spaniel, breaks his fall.  A
<br />
second Walker, wearing a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament for no
<br />
particular reason, challenges Sonic to solve the Riddle of the
<br />
Rings.  Sonic guesses the answer and is buried by coiled chains
<br />
of power rings for his trouble.  Their accumulated weight drag
<br />
him down under the sea of emeralds where, rat-like, he is forced
<br />
to run on the inside of the aforementioned power ring.  He
<br />
confronts the third Walker who subjects him to one of the oldest
<br />
gags in the business.  There follows an entirely useless page of
<br />
Sonic trying unsuccessfully to make sense out of the preceding
<br />
eleven pages until, finally, he emerges back in his own
<br />
dimension, ring in hand, disabling Robotnik's hover unit in the
<br />
process.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher gets major points for stretching, for writing a
<br />
story beyond the Sonic Vs. Robotnik And If You Have To Wonder Who
<br />
Will Win Then You Must Be New In Town genre.  Aside from the
<br />
small problems with this story (the billion ring business, the
<br />
&quot;Playboy&quot; pun that misfires), there's a more fundamental flaw. 
<br />
And since &quot;Prof. Fulop&quot; invited &quot;scholarly&quot; evaluations (in a box
<br />
on page 14) I humbly submit:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A COMPARISON OF THE STRUCTURE OF &quot;RING OF TRUTH&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITH THE MESOPOTAMIAN &quot;EPIC OF GILGAMESH&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Epic of Gilgamesh, which dates back to the first
<br />
millennium BCE, is a prototypical tale of a hero's quest.  &quot;Ring
<br />
of Truth,&quot; on the other hand, deviates from the Gilgamesh model
<br />
in several important ways:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Gilgamesh, the hero at one point undertakes a quest. 
<br />
This quest has a purpose: to obtain a magic flower that will undo
<br />
the death of Gilgamesh's best friend, Enkidu, who died as a
<br />
result of their fighting against the Bull of Heaven.  Sonic,
<br />
however, stumbles upon the zone of the Ancient Walkers strictly
<br />
by accident.  He just happened to grab the requisite number of
<br />
rings.  It really doesn't count as a &quot;quest&quot; if it's accidental. 
<br />
The same weakness showed up in &quot;Southern Crossover, Part 3,&quot;
<br />
where Tails just has the events of Mobian prehistory channelled
<br />
through him to no obvious purpose or benefit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second flaw in the story &quot;Ring of Truth&quot; involves
<br />
Sonic's inability to learn from what has happened (and to impart
<br />
said knowledge to the reader).  For Gilgamesh, his quest ends
<br />
when, having obtained the flower, it is taken from him by a
<br />
serpent and the god Utnapishtim delivers the punch line: that in
<br />
life there are no second chances.  By page 14 of &quot;Ring of Truth,&quot;
<br />
on the other hand, all we are left with is a metaphysical
<br />
mishmosh that gives Sonic a headache and which offers the reader
<br />
a number of meanings to choose from:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.   Yes!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.   This Isn't Fair!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.   Forty-Two!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.   Some Of The Above!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn't help matters that his &quot;guides&quot; on the path of
<br />
enlightenment are less than convincing.  Since their debut in
<br />
&quot;Tttriple Tttrouble&quot; [Game Gear Adaptation #1], the Ancient
<br />
Walkers have been saddled with the burden of Dave Manak's
<br />
artwork.  Our hedgehog hero is up against some heavy cosmic
<br />
stuff; Manak, however, manages to transform &quot;cosmic&quot; into
<br />
&quot;comic.&quot;  His Walkers look like people wearing rather
<br />
unconvincing rubber dinosaur suits and masks that look like they
<br />
belong on the walls of Trader Vic's or some other tiki and
<br />
tropical drink bar.  Even Spaziante's sparse cover rendering of
<br />
the same masks cannot save them from looking, quite frankly,
<br />
ridiculous.  A little more thought in this story could have
<br />
prevented it from ending up as a lot of mystical sound and fury,
<br />
signifying nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Sense of History, Part 2&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story and Art: Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Knuckles continues to flash back, it is now about four
<br />
generations after Echidnapolis went airborne thanks to the
<br />
installation of a dozen chaos emeralds.  Two echidna brothers,
<br />
Edmund and Dmitri, survey the chaos chamber where the emeralds
<br />
continue to radiate.  Their proposal to return the floating
<br />
island to the ground by means of a &quot;chaos syphon&quot; that would
<br />
gradually leach power from the stones, is sharply denied by the
<br />
scientific establishment who aren't in a mood to tamper with the
<br />
forces of nature.  Enraged by such narrowmindedness, Dmitri uses
<br />
the prototype of the syphon on the emeralds.  It succeeds in
<br />
reducing eleven of the twelve stones to charred shards and
<br />
transforms Dmitri into a being with &quot;the energies of eleven
<br />
shattered chaos emeralds howling within him.&quot; [Note to Ken
<br />
Penders: Great line!]  Dmitri then either calls forth, or else
<br />
morphs into, Mount Fate.  To be continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now THIS is more like it!  If you're going to be mystical,
<br />
you can be linear about it as well.  So how exactly does echidna
<br />
civilization come to an end?  THAT'S what I call a tease.  This
<br />
just about makes me forget about all those 2-month vamps.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams, etc.:  The cover of #36 is interesting, not
<br />
just because Spaz has given us yet another tail shot of Sally,
<br />
but because she and Sonic apparently come face to helmet with one
<br />
of Sauron's Black Riders.  That's a High Concept plot for you:
<br />
Mobius meets Middle Earth!  I can only hope that this &quot;quest&quot;
<br />
isn't an ongoing excuse to put Sonic et al. in different settings
<br />
outside Mobius.  By me, it would be a tacit admission that the
<br />
writers had run dry and they couldn't come up with any more story
<br />
ideas involving the basic concept.  We'll know better next month.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great, Scott!  You're outta here!  Then again, Ken Penders
<br />
has spoken of you in the past tense for some time now, so the
<br />
move must've been a done deal by the time this went to press. 
<br />
Ken also said Scott quit to pursue some writing.  Let's see: he
<br />
contributed six editorial boxes to &quot;Ring of Truth&quot; and ten to
<br />
&quot;Crash of the Titans.&quot;  So why am I not surprised that he wanted
<br />
to write?  Let's hope Fred Mendez does a better job of keeping
<br />
his ego in check.  Letters: a Canadian reader contributes a Sonic
<br />
rap and manages to finish each line without including the word
<br />
&quot;Eh?&quot;.  The other letter (there are only two) asks if Knuckles
<br />
has hands inside his gloves [no, they're hooks, you little...let
<br />
us pause a moment to weep for this younger generation], and asks
<br />
whatever happened to the ABC series.  Scott shines him off by
<br />
blaming Robotnik's stranglehold on the mainstream media and by
<br />
saying that Sonic was too fast for the time slot.  OK, I'm also
<br />
disappointed that he didn't advise the kid to read my FAQ File. 
<br />
Maybe Fred knows enough to credit the computer-literate among the
<br />
readership.  Heck, you ever count how many commercials are now
<br />
featuring the addresses of Web pages?  Our day will come, Cyber-
<br />
Mobians!
