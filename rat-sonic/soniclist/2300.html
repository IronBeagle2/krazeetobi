Kris, aka gt6005a_at_prism.gatech.edu sez:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; IMO, a healthy boyfriend-girlfriend (or whatever) relationship is not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; purely mental in basis.  Sure, it's usually best if such a relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; *is* grounded firmly in mutual interests and whatnot, but let's face 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; facts; we're mammals.  We don't reproduce by budding, okay?  We're
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; sexual animals, after all, and we all feel the primal urge at one time
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; or another.  Naturally, this should be fodder in any realistic look
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; at Mobius for a few stories.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But that isn't what these characters were created for.  Understand this:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Mobius and its inhabitants exist in *fiction*.  How they act and what they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;do is entirely up to the creators of these characters.  To fly off the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;handle and have these characters doing what the authors never intended for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them to do, and then try to cover it in the shroud of 'realism'... that feels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very cold.
</em><br />

<br />
Okay, I'll accept some of that.  One shouldn't try to completely change
<br />
around the direction of the character when one writes a story about
<br />
him/her, after all.  That's just common sense.
<br />

<br />
What I *do* think is &quot;fair use&quot; is trying to make their relationships
<br />
a bit more real, and make them act a bit more mature than the usual
<br />
Manak fare.  Yes, it has gone a bit over the edge at times, but
<br />
&quot;Tail&quot; (at least in MY opinion) was pretty pedestrian compared to
<br />
what it COULD have done.
<br />

<br />
However, I see where you're coming from, Kris.  You have a certain
<br />
perception of the Sonic universe; I have my own, Bookshire has his,
<br />
etc etc.  If you don't like a fanfic story, you can always not read it.
<br />
Nobody's forcing you to download it, or page through it, or even look
<br />
at the title.  The little warning label was there at the top of the
<br />
story, in the description, and in the blurb the author posted to the
<br />
list.
<br />

<br />
Censorship is bad.  Even though I didn't like the porno pics, I'm quite
<br />
angry that Bookshire had to take them off.  Even though I don't like
<br />
all of the stories on his page, I'd yowl like a speared cat if so much
<br />
as *one* was taken off because of content.  And I'm sure you wouldn't
<br />
want THAT.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that should be *all* that one focuses on, before you get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the revolver out and plug me...but you can't just *ignore* it, either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the original creators choose to ignore it, it is ignored.  If you want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a more 'realistic' look at how a a sentient male hedgehog and a sentient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;female squirrel would react to each other, then how about creating your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;own characters to do so?  Leave Sonic and Sally out of it.
</em><br />

<br />
Kris, the &quot;original creators&quot; of Sonic the Hedgehog were a bunch of crusty
<br />
coder-dudes in Redmond (or whereever) that were making a cool game to
<br />
keep Sega from getting whooped by Nintendo.  Everything else sort of
<br />
branched out of that.  C'mon, Kris, Sonic was just a corporate sponsor
<br />
before us fanfic people started giving him *soul*.  We have done most of
<br />
the maturation of the characters; yes, Archie and Fleetway have paved
<br />
the way for us, but we continually take these characters to new levels
<br />
of...well, coolness on a monthly basis.
<br />

<br />
I really don't understand why you're becoming so irate about this.  I can
<br />
see the reasoning, I can understand the argument, but I can't understand
<br />
*why* this one fanfic story has lit your candle so.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; It's a part of human (and Mobian) nature to desire physical and mental
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; love, fellas.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'll believe that when the characters creators say that.
</em><br />

<br />
The people who made these characters are probably off working on 
<br />
&quot;Virtua Fighter II&quot; or something.  Cut us some slack.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; And, IMO, &quot;Tail&quot; was written well enough to qualify as a coming-of-age
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; story in its own right.  It didn't get overly detailed about some of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the aspects of sexual reproduction, it didn't make one's stomach turn...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; hell, it was pretty friggin' funny in a few places.  Kudos to the author
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; of it; I wish *I* could have written it first.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Maybe so.  Again I feel the it should have been written with original
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characters.
</em><br />

<br />
Hey, your opinion, not mine.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;later---Kris

<br />
Joe.
