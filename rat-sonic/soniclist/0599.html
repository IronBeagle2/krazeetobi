<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor emerged from his lab early the next morning.  It was fairly dark for
<br />
morning, and cold.  He looked up and saw the dark, looming clouds overhead.
<br />
&quot;Rain,&quot; he thought to himself and made his way over to the center of the
<br />
village. Bookshire was already there, sitting at a table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you always get up this early?&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, not always,&quot; Bookshire calmly answered.  &quot;Can't get the Swat-bot to
<br />
activate?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I've tried everything I can think of and it just sits there.  It all
<br />
seemed so easy.  Just steal a Swat-bot and examine it's technology.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Could I take a look at it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go ahead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire suddenly got up and hurriedly limped over to Rotor's lab.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll need your help!&quot; he called behind him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in the lab, Bookshire knew exactly what to do.  &quot;We'll both grab an
<br />
arm and drag it over to my place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took the Swat-bot to Bookshire's hut and put it on a table.  It was
<br />
Bookshire's first time being able to carefully examine a Swat-bot and he was
<br />
very excited.  He searched for some sort of serial port on the Swat-bot.
<br />
Turning the head to one side, he opened a small panel and there it was.  He
<br />
opened another small panel, this time on his computer, and a cable ejected
<br />
from it.  Taking the cable in one hand, he pulled it over to the port in the
<br />
Swat-bot's head, neatly unwinding as it went, and plugged it in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, computer,&quot; Bookshire told it, &quot;open a direct link through port A.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Open,&quot; the computer reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access the main memory matrix.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access denied.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As expected.  Try it again using Cryptosmasher software.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer worked on it for a second and reported, &quot;Access granted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Display the boot-up data.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The screen started to fill with a bunch of seemingly random characters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait, wait, wait.  Decompile it first.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a bit longer to do this, but soon the gibberish stopped and was
<br />
replaced with (somewhat) plain English.  Bookshire was very excited now, he
<br />
started to look through the code.  Rotor sat and watched.  It was a long
<br />
while before anybody spoke again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Getting anywhere?&quot; Rotor asked rhetorically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Actually, yes,&quot; answered Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What did you find out?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it won't activate because somebody doesn't want it to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Swat-bot's fine.  Nothing is actually 'wrong' with it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Buuuuut...&quot; Rotor said slowly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But somebody altered the boot-up data so that it won't activate
<br />
unless...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unleeeeess...&quot; he urged Bookshire on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah!  Here it is!  Unless you find the problem and fix it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Isn't that what you're supposed to do when there's a problem--fix it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, yes.  But normally when somebody sabotages something, they don't
<br />
intend for it to be fixed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you're saying that somebody sabotaged this Swat-bot, possibly many
<br />
others, and wanted Robotnik to know about it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly.  It was pretty hard to find the problem, but whoever did this
<br />
definitely wanted Robotnik to find it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But......why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because of this: computer, display string: 'problem.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few lines of text were displayed.  Rotor read it aloud:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Robotnik,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a while.  How are things going?  Looking forward to a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reply.  Send Snively to following co-ords, haven't seen him in a while:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;33 S, 75 E.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Send Snively?  If this guy's working for Robotnik, why would he put his
<br />
message in a Swat-bot?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have no idea.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe we should tell Sally.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!&quot; Robotnik's face appeared in one of the monitors of Snively's
<br />
hover unit.  &quot;Have you located the prisoner yet?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Snively, &quot;no, sir.  But he couldn't have gotten far.&quot;  He
<br />
turned to another console and pushed a few buttons.  &quot;Stealth-bots, Epsilon
<br />
squadron, report.&quot;  There came no reply.  &quot;Report, Epsilon!&quot;  Still no reply.
<br />
&quot;Theta squadron, report.&quot;  No reply from them either.  Snively was getting
<br />
nervous.  &quot;Alpha squadron?&quot;  No reply.  &quot;Beta?&quot;  No reply.  &quot;Anybody!?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't like what I'm hearing, Snively.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively was shaking now.  &quot;It seems that communications are down,
<br />
s-s-sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then get them back up!  I don't want--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Robotnik.&quot;  It was the prisoner, on every monitor.  &quot;Having fun?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you doing on my communications channel?&quot; asked Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, nothing much.  Just getting revenge.  I mean, you DID try to
<br />
roboticize me.&quot;  Robotnik was just about to speak when the prisoner spoke
<br />
first, &quot;Don't worry, I'm not taking it personally.  I'll just have my revenge
<br />
and leave you alone.&quot;  He walked off the screen for a few seconds and came
<br />
back grinning.  Suddenly, the entire city lost power.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How can he DO that!?!&quot; Robotnik called out.  &quot;Were you tracing that?&quot; he
<br />
asked Packbell, who had been in the room with Robotnik, working on the
<br />
location of the prisoner.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course.  Omega squadron is on their way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent!  Let's go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor and Bookshire headed over to Sally's hut where they found her and
<br />
Bunny deep in a conversation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Glad you're here,&quot; Sally greeted them.  &quot;We got another note from Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  It says:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A prisoner escaped yesterday and blacked out the entire city.  Better send
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic for all the details.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where's Sonic?&quot; asked Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He left about ten minutes ago.  Do you have any clue as to what this
<br />
means?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd say so,&quot; said Bookshire.   He explained in detail what he had found
<br />
in the Swat-bot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's obviously the work of another freedom fighter,&quot; hypothesized Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It can't be any old freedom fighter,&quot; Bookshire told her.  &quot;Don't you
<br />
see?  Nobody can just black out a city.  Whoever did this is an extremely
<br />
powerful individual.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe Naugus found a way back from that void place,&quot; said Bunny.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; contributed Sally, &quot;Naugus would take care of Robotnik directly.
<br />
Whoever it is would be an invaluable addition to Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But how can we find this person?&quot; asked Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess we'll just have to wait for--&quot;  Sally was just finishing her
<br />
sentence as Sonic came through the door with Charles right behind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think you guys better hear this,&quot; suggested Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Three days ago,&quot; Charles began, &quot;Robotnik's forces overpowered a small
<br />
village just outside the Great Swamp.  The prisoners were taken back to
<br />
Robotropolis to await robotization.  The very next day, most of them were
<br />
roboticized.  Some of them Robotnik kept to be interrogated.  Yesterday, one
<br />
of the prisoners escaped during the interrogation.  Just this morning, he
<br />
blacked out all of Robotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If he's so powerful, why not just overthrow Robotnik?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe he can't,&quot; assumed Bunny.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not from what I just heard,&quot; said Bookshire.  &quot;This person can do
<br />
anything, he just doesn't want to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doesn't want to!?!&quot; Sonic entered the conversation.  &quot;We need to find
<br />
this guy and bring him back here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WE?&quot; rebutted Sally.  &quot;WE won't be able to get anywhere NEAR Robotropolis
<br />
with all the patrols out looking for him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then WE will just have to get a power ring.&quot;  Sonic had already made up
<br />
his mind and was exiting the room.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lights everywhere were turning back on.  &quot;Sir,&quot; came Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it, Snively?&quot; Robotnik impatiently asked.  He had more important
<br />
things to attend to.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The power is back on-line.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I noticed.  Thank you, Snively.&quot;  He put his communicator down.  &quot;Move
<br />
aside,&quot; ordered Robotnik as he pushed two Swat-bots out of his way.  There
<br />
were at least fifteen others, each with a laser rifle aimed at the prisoner,
<br />
who was sitting in the middle of it all.  Six Stealth-bots hovered overhead.
<br />
&quot;So...&quot; said Robotnik confidently.  &quot;The tables have turned.  Would you like
<br />
to answer some questions now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Under normal circumstances,&quot; said the prisoner as if he was negotiating
<br />
with Robotnik, &quot;this would be a dire situation.  But there's been this dragon
<br />
flying around and--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dragon?&quot; said Robotnik in disbelief as he flung around and looked up.
<br />
There was Dulcy, circling the area.  &quot;The hedgehog!  All units, full alert!
<br />
Activate heat scanners!  You two,&quot; he pointed to two Stealth-bots, &quot;get that
<br />
dragon!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hedgehog detected,&quot; said one of the Swat-bots in its monotonous voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic came around a corner, dodging lasers, and charged a Swat-bot.  At
<br />
the last second, he curled up with quills blazing and sliced right through
<br />
it.  He then grabbed the prisoner and continued onward to Knothole with Dulcy
<br />
not far behind.  The Swat-bots took their last, futile shots at Sonic as he
<br />
disappeared over the horizon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I HATE you, Hedgehog!&quot; Robotnik called after him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team regrouped in the war room, with just about everybody else, and
<br />
immediately began an interrogation of their &quot;prisoner.&quot;  Now they could get a
<br />
close look at him.  He looked like an armadillo, and yet, was not.  He was
<br />
definitely older than sixteen, but nobody was quite sure by how much.  Sonic,
<br />
realizing that there were more important aspects to a person besides physical
<br />
characteristics, began the interrogation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, bud,&quot; said Sonic, &quot;why'd you blow our cover?  You could've ruined
<br />
the whole operation!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Part of the reason is that I didn't know who was flying around up there,
<br />
and I still don't,&quot; said the prisoner, looking at Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I'm Dulcy,&quot; she answered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hello, Dulcy.  You can call me Williams.  The other part is that it
<br />
distracted Robotnik so I could escape, but I see Sonic rescued me first,&quot; he
<br />
said, nodding in Sonic's direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know who I am?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure.  Robotnik always talks about you.  Boy, he REALLY hates you.  Did
<br />
you know that you've been officially declared the 'priority hedgehog?'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can access his computer core?&quot; asked Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course.  Contrary to popular belief, living in a tiny village in the
<br />
middle of nowhere DOES get boring.  It's amazing what you can do when you're
<br />
bored.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So you can break into Robotnik's systems any time you want without him
<br />
knowing about it and you never bothered to disable any of them?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why should I?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was agitated.  &quot;Maybe it would be a little easier to win the war if
<br />
Robotnik didn't have any defenses, don't you think?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;War?  I wouldn't consider this a war.  Think of it as a change it
<br />
government,&quot; said Williams with an optimistic smile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was angry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Speaking of wars, I thought Mobitropolis was supposed to have a huge,
<br />
powerful army.  Didn't WE win the Great War?  Where was our army when
<br />
Robotnik took over?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He already knew the answer.  After the Great War, the king gave his
<br />
permission for Robotnik to dismantled the army.  (Back then no one ever
<br />
suspected him of plotting against the king.)  Instead, he improved it and
<br />
used it to take over the planet.  Mobitropolis had been conquered by it's own
<br />
army.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was very angry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Isn't it true that your father was the cause of the whole thing?  Maybe
<br />
he planned--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;STOP IT!!!&quot;  Sally was enraged.  &quot;My father was an honest, trustworthy
<br />
man and would never, EVER start a war that takes innocent lives!&quot;  She ran
<br />
out of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally!&quot; called Dulcy as she went out after her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're worse than Robuttnik,&quot; accused Sonic.  He began his search for
<br />
Sally and Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That left Rotor and Antoine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What I want to know,&quot; asked Rotor, &quot;is who put the message in the
<br />
Swat-bot?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I did,&quot; answered Williams.  &quot;Robotnik doesn't pay any attention to them
<br />
anymore, but they give me something to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm assuming you're also the one who blacked out Robotropolis?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, huh,&quot; he nodded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That brings me back to Sally's question.  If you're against Robotnik, why
<br />
not just end the war now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;First of all, I'm not in this war.  Think of me as an impartial
<br />
observer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Impartial observers don't black out cities.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Only when they're captured, interrogated, and almost roboticized.
<br />
Secondly, this is Knothole, right?  Robotnik's been looking for this place
<br />
for years.  I could tell him where it is and end the war that way.  In fact,
<br />
why don't I do that.  Computer, transmit current coordinates to everywhere in
<br />
Robotropolis.  You better hope Robotnik isn't looking at a monitor right
<br />
now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You fuel!&quot; screamed Antoine.  &quot;You are going to get us all captivated!&quot;
<br />
He ran out of the room, screaming for somebody to come help him.  Soon after,
<br />
Sonic came rushing to his rescue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it now, Ant?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are all doom-ed, DOOM-ED!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor emerged from the War Room.  &quot;Williams gave away Knothole's location.
<br />
Robotnik could be on his way right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By now, Sally had arrived with Bunny.  &quot;What is going on?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams told Robotnik where Knothole is,&quot; answered Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's gone WAY too far this time,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire had an idea of what was going on, so he entered the War Room and
<br />
closed the door behind him.  As he did, Williams stopped transmitting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You didn't really give away our location, did you?&quot; he asked Williams,
<br />
expecting an answer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, why?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That wasn't the answer he was expecting.  &quot;I can't believe you.  You've
<br />
got the whole village scared to death that they'll all be roboticized, and
<br />
they just might be!  What are you going to do now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll just slip out through the window and leave you to explain
<br />
everything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't come back anytime soon, if I were you.  It seems the entire
<br />
village hates you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But you don't hate me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure what to think.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, Williams was gone.  Bookshire faced the mob of panicked
<br />
citizens and explained what had happened.  A few accusations against him
<br />
later, the crowd had dispersed and things were returning to normal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah'm sure glad that's over,&quot; Bunny voiced her opinion to Sally as they
<br />
walked back to their huts.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me too,&quot; replied Sally.  &quot;I guess if Robotnik was going to attack,
<br />
he'd've been here by now.  I bet Tails is--&quot;  She stopped walking.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong, Sally-girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have you seen Tails lately?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, but--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally didn't care to hear the rest.  She quickly found Sonic, also headed
<br />
for his hut, and asked him the same question.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nope, not since we left to go find that Williams guy,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They both started to worry.  Usually, Tails is were the action is.  They
<br />
checked their huts and anywhere else Tails might have gone, but he was no
<br />
where to be found.
<br />

<br />
