<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This is to all concerned -

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SEGA has a very strong vested interest in the little blue critter. The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; problem is maintaining fan support among the GAMING SYSTEMS, from what I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tell. Let's put it this way. There was Atari, then the Commodore, then the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Amiga, then finally Nintendo unleashed the Super Mario Bros. and became a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; monster. SEGA struck back with SONIC on the GENESIS SYSTEM and defeated
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Mario. They countered with GAME GEAR which was superior to Game Boy. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; came out with the CD SYSTEM while  Nintendo was reeling with the Super NES.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But then came the 3DO and SONY PLAYSTATION and other CD format systems,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; creating confusion in the market place. Instead of getting the SATURN out to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; counter these other systems, SEGA made a Nintendo-like mistake by coming out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the 32-X. 
</em><br />

<br />
SOA still have loads of support on all their platforms (except the 32X). 
<br />
But like I keep saying, both Sega companies have decided to push Sonic 
<br />
onto the back burner to let their new &quot;heroes&quot; pave the way. To quote the 
<br />
head of SOJ, &quot;We don't want Sonic running the Saturn the same way he ran 
<br />
the MegaDrive...&quot;
<br />
If you look at the Saturn, people are buying it for Sega Rally 
<br />
Championship and Virtua Fighter 2, they aren't buying it in hopes of 
<br />
playing V Sonic or Fighting Sonic. And as for Fighting Sonic, SOA have 
<br />
said outright that they won't release the game in the states. Perhaps a 
<br />
ton of mail to them may change this.
<br />
As for confusion, there is some, but not as much as you think. There is 
<br />
an old saying in gamer's circles, &quot;Buy a system for it's games, not for 
<br />
it's specs.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Right now, there's a shake-up going on in the marketplace. Only so much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; product can receive public support before the public says enough and clamors
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for sanity. The public right now wants to feel they aren't buying a system
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that'll be out of date by next year. So far, the best compromise seems to be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; buying games you can play on your PC, instead of messingaround trying to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; figure out which is the best system to get.
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, videogame systems are much more stable than PC's. A videogame 
<br />
system takes on average 5 years to become phased out, a new PC does this 
<br />
in about 6 months. Not to mention that a computer is a serious investment 
<br />
for some people, if all they want to do is play games, what can beat 
<br />
paying $90 for a system and then around $50 for games, not to mention 
<br />
that a videogame system is much easier to use and doesn't require its 
<br />
user to understand OS's.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; People like me are frustrated because while I like SEGA gaming systems and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SONIC THE HEDGEHOG games as well as a variety of others, right now games are
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going exclusively with certain systems instead of being available for every
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; platform like they used to be. For instance, I'm looking forward to playing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the new GOLDENEYE game, but it's ONLY going to be made available for the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; latest Nintendo system. And you're going to see more and more of this sort of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing as companies fight for a bigger piece of the market share.
</em><br />

<br />
Well, unless I was mistaken, Sonic is Sega's mascot, and will only ever 
<br />
be available on Sega based systems, and perhaps PC's (with the correct 
<br />
liscencing agreements), but you won't ever see Sonic on the Playstation 
<br />
or on the U64. Cross-liscencing only occurs when the 3rd part company 
<br />
finds that all the 1st party companies will support it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SEGA will support SONIC because of his acceptance in the marketplace. They
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; just may tend to downplay him because they may feel he only attracts a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; certain segment of the market, and they want to reach a broader audience.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Only if the fan base makes its support of SONIC known to SEGA will the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; corporate suits be able to determine the breadth and depth of that support.
</em><br />

<br />
Yes they will, but I always hear talk about this &quot;market segment&quot;. 
<br />
Perhaps you hadn't figured it out by now, but the white-coats working at 
<br />
SOA have absolutely NO idea what we want. This has been proven time and 
<br />
time again. And a broader audience? The average age of a US Genesis 
<br />
owner is 18, and the average age of a US Sega CD owner is 21, basically 
<br />
college students like myself. Those with lots of money to burn. But 
<br />
again, its SOA's white-coats who think we want games like Corpse Killer, 
<br />
instead of our &quot;childish&quot; Sonic games. This is where the problem comes in.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; SONIC isn't dead. Not by a long shot.
</em><br />

<br />
Sonic will never die so long as there are fans like us to keep him alive.
