Yeep.  Quite a lot of stuff already posted on this thread.  Let's see if 
<br />
I can't pick out a topic or seven for reply...  (:3

MW&gt; Hi all.  I'm brand new to this mailing list, and, well, I work for
<br />
MW&gt; Sega.  :)
<br />

<br />
Cool!  (:3  Always nice to have a Sega presence in the group.  
<br />
Personally, I think Sega should have an official presence in r.v.g.sega, 
<br />
but that's another topic...
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; I'm an Associate Producer in the STI group (the group that did Sonic
<br />
MW&gt; 2, Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3, and Sonic &amp; Knuckles),
<br />

<br />
Now this is strange.  I rented Spinball just the other day, and I could 
<br />
have sworn a different team had done it.  (For one thing, no offense, but 
<br />
the graphics weren't up to the usual 'par' for Sonic games.)  Still, you 
<br />
guys do good work; I've got Sonics 1, 2, and K, and will get 3 when I can 
<br />
afford it.
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; and I'm curious as to what Sonic fans and gamers would like to see
<br />
MW&gt; and/or expect from another Sonic game.  We're planning on having one
<br />
MW&gt; out for the 32X, so I'd like to hear from all you Sonic fans. 
<br />

<br />
Well, let me first reiterate what several others have said: I want a 
<br />
&quot;Tails&quot; game.  And I'm 21, so I don't want some Pico thing or some 
<br />
walk-through game; I want something as challenging as the typical Sonic 
<br />
game featuring the Happy Fun Fox.  Failing that, keep Tails in future 
<br />
Sonic games and keep giving him stuff to do that Sonic can't match.  
<br />
Tails in Sonic 2 was a poor man's Sonic; in Sonic 3, he started to come 
<br />
into his own, but it wasn't really until S3&amp;K, with Super Tails, that he 
<br />
became about even with the spiky blue speed demon.  I look to see him in 
<br />
Sonic 4 (or would that be Sonic 32X?) with new paths to take, new worlds 
<br />
to explore, and maybe even an entire Zone just for him (while Sonic's 
<br />
taking on Robotnik's latest plot on the ground, Tails takes to the air or 
<br />
water as a shortcut to the fiend's base...)  And give Super Tails some 
<br />
cool frizzy do-not-taunt-Happy-Fun-Fox graphics instead of just flashing 
<br />
his palette.
<br />

<br />
Got the idea yet that I'm a fan of Miles Prower?  (:3

MY&gt; How about the rings as weapons, tossed projectiles?
<br />

<br />
I don't like this idea for any of the existing characters (Sonic, Tails, 
<br />
and Knuckles) but it'd be a neat thing to add if a new playable character 
<br />
is added to the next game.  While I'm thinking of it: in Sonic 4, allow 
<br />
people to mix-and-match their team of two characters (i.e., allow Tails 
<br />
to play lead with Sonic backup, or even Knuckles and Tails).  Sonic, when 
<br />
CPU controlled, can make his entrance in a blast of speed; Knuckles can 
<br />
just pop out of the ground.  (:3
<br />

<br />
MY&gt; I really liked the idea for Super Sonic using the rings as time for
<br />
MY&gt; being Super. 
<br />

<br />
Random thought #17: allow the player to 'turn off' Super to conserve 
<br />
rings in parts they're confident of their chances in.  (Perhaps the 
<br />
mechanism of becoming Super should be pushing a button whilst paused, or 
<br />
something akin; do the same to reverse it...)
<br />

<br />
MY&gt; try a 32X-CD Sonic game... now that would rock! 
<br />

<br />
As was later mentioned, this would be a fairly restricted market, but 
<br />
that doesnt' mean I wouldn't want to see it.  It might be the incentive I 
<br />
need to get a 32X.  (:3  Maybe a FMV Sonic (but *please* none of that 
<br />
'make correct choice and see more video, make wrong choice and don't' 
<br />
crap we've been getting lately.  Have branching plots and stuff; 
<br />
animation will compress a lot better than film, so you'll have room for 
<br />
that sort of thing...)  Or maybe a Sonic RPG (Popful Mail's doing the 
<br />
platform/RPG crossover; why can't Sonic?)
<br />

<br />
MY&gt; How about that Sonic arcade game that never really made it?
<br />

<br />
Haven't heard of this.  Tell me more?
<br />

CM&gt; Anyway, I would like to see more of tails or better yet, All of the
<br />
CM&gt; freedom fighters. I havn't played any of the games but from what I here,
<br />
CM&gt; the other freedom fighters havn't shown up in any of the games (But I
<br />
CM&gt; could be wrong on this.)
<br />

<br />
The other Freedom Fighters were invented for the comic/cartoon (only the 
<br />
Saturday one) and made only a cameo appearance in Sonic Spinball.  I 
<br />
wouldn't mind seeing them, but they'd probably be more appropriate for an 
<br />
RPG (I dare to dream again...) or in guest slots than as playable 
<br />
characters in a Sonic platformer; they just don't move fast enough.  (:3
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Paul Gettle wrote a bunch of stuff I have no comment on, plus:
<br />

<br />
PG&gt; Fully incorporate the characters from the Saturday Morning cartoon. 
<br />

<br />
Already commented on.
<br />

<br />
PG&gt; Make the game less linear. Give us some freedom to chose different
<br />
PG&gt; paths, with different levels to play. You've allready taken some steps
<br />
PG&gt; in that direction with the three different characters that you can play
<br />
PG&gt; with Sonic 3 locked on to Sonic and Knuckles (Major kudos for that
<br />
PG&gt; advancement BTW). Depending on if you played Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles,
<br />
PG&gt; you took different routes through the levels. Just give us the ability
<br />
PG&gt; to take different levels entirely. 
<br />

<br />
Agreed.  Keep continuity between the plot lines, though; it bugs me that
<br />
when playing as Knuckles, one never gets to pound on or be pounded on by
<br />
Sonic, much less see the Death Egg; and Tails only gets a subset of
<br />
Sonic's ending.  S3&amp;K would have been cooler if Tails had gotten to go to 
<br />
the Doomsday Zone; it would have been even *cooler* if he'd had his own 
<br />
special Zone, perhaps an aerial dogfight (foxfight?)
<br />

<br />
PG&gt; Finally, the sugestion that I hear most, from fans and non-fans 
<br />
PG&gt; alike......
<br />

<br />
PG&gt; GIVE TAILS HIS OWN GAME!!!!!!!!
<br />
PG&gt; PLEASE!
<br />

<br />
Thirded.  (:3
<br />

<br />
Then Mike Wallis wrote some more:
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; We do have an original 32X version of Sonic in the works, so SOA hasn't
<br />
MW&gt; forgotten about our blue-friend. 
<br />

<br />
Is this going to be a more typical Sonic release, as opposed to the 
<br />
first-person view of Chaotix?  Anything NDAs don't prevent you from 
<br />
telling us?  (:3
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; Although, according to recent SOA marketing studies, Knuckles is a
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; very popular guy... So popular that the execs felt he deserved his own
<br />
MW&gt; game. 
<br />

<br />
Well, tell those execs that *this* Sega consumer wants a Tails game.  (:3
<br />

<br />
MW&gt; There's been a lot of asking for a Tails-only game:  How do you think
<br />
MW&gt; consumers would react to that type of game, assuming it was a game in
<br />
MW&gt; similar fashion to the &quot;Sonic-series&quot; of games, only better utilizing
<br />
MW&gt; the abilities of our flying fox? 
<br />

<br />
I'm not who you asked, but speaking for this customer, I'd buy it as soon 
<br />
as the check would clear.  (:3
