Part 3
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Robotnik was sitting in his command chair, drumming his fingers. 
<br />
He had been doing so for some time, and Snively was beginning to wonder
<br />
just what was going through his mind.  Either he's really concentrating,
<br />
Snively thought, or the old fool has finally blown his mind.  Snively had
<br />
to cover his mouth to keep from chuckling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, Robotnik spoke.  &quot;Snively, tell me again why I'm not
<br />
roboticizing those humans in Nilreb?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, not this again.  &quot;Because, sir, you planned to make Mobius a
<br />
place where only humans would live, free from all of the other furry
<br />
creatures.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, yes, but I'm beginning to realize even they aren't worth
<br />
saving.  Do you think any of them could ever match my intellect?  Do you
<br />
think any of them will ever accurately comprehend my visions, my dreams of
<br />
the future?  And what about these reports I keep getting saying some of
<br />
them are actually helping other animals?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively was worried.  If he roboticized all the humans the way he was
<br />
doing everybody else, who would be left?  Snively didn't want to live in
<br />
such a world.  &quot;But sir, you can't roboticize everybody!  Who would be
<br />
around to run the machines?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me, of course!  And you, perhaps, unless you keep questioning me
<br />
like that!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively gulped.  &quot;But, but... you can't live forever!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We will see about that.  I have come this far.  Do you really think
<br />
that I am going to let something like death stop me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik fell silent again, and Snively turned back around, unable to
<br />
pay attention to his work.  He has blown his mind, Snively thought.  He
<br />
wasn't chuckling anymore.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik said at last, &quot;Well Snively, I have made up my mind.  You
<br />
will excuse me while I go to set up my plans.&quot;  He stood and walked out of
<br />
the command center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively sighed.  Sure, he hated non-human animals as much as Robotnik
<br />
did, but to roboticize the humans as well?  This is one time where I hope
<br />
you fail, Robotnik, he thought.  I don't know how, but I hope you fail.
<br />
