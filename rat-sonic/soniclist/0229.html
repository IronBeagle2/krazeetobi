**WARNING**
<br />
Video game (among other things) discussion ensues.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; While I'm thinking of the games, anyone else share my gripe that the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plots for Sonic and Knuckles in S3&amp;K (in case I'm confusing anyone with 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; this abbreviation, it's Sonic 3 and Sonick&amp;Knuckles locked together) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; diverge so widely at the end?  I mean, Knuckles never sees either Sonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; or the Death Egg... and poor Tails is stuck being the poor man's Sonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; again (at least this time they let him fly and swim and stuff).  Ah 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; well.  Maybe some day they'll do a Tails game for the Sega...
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, IMO the divergent endings make sense.  Look at it this way:
<br />

<br />
Knuckles is someone who doesn't know a thing about the wars between Robotnik
<br />
and the animals.  He only cares about the protection of Floating Island and
<br />
its Chaos Emeralds.  As long as the island is safe and there are no
<br />
potential evil forces surrounding it, he's happy.  This was why
<br />
he is such a pain for Sonic during most of the game.  Robotnik was able
<br />
to convince him that Sonic was the one trying to steal the Emeralds.  Only
<br />
when Knuckles sees Robotnik himself heisting the Master Emerald does he
<br />
realize who the real bad guy is.
<br />

<br />
On the other hand, Sonic has spent the last two games (whatever time frame
<br />
that translates to) fighting Robotnik, and is ready to pursue him (quite
<br />
literally) to the ends of the Earth if necessary.  If Robotnik fleas into
<br />
space, Sonic will follow.
<br />

<br />
Of course, the two endings taken at face value still don't make sense when
<br />
put together.  For one thing, where does the Master Emerald finally end up:
<br />
in Metal-Sonic's hands or Robotnik's?  So here's how I view it:
<br />

<br />
When Knuckles finally realizes that Sonic is a good guy, he takes Sonic's
<br />
word that Sonic will retrieve the Master Emerald from Robotnik by any means
<br />
necessary.  Then, after Metal-Sonic fails to hold Sonic and Tails at bay,
<br />
Robotnik fleas with the Master Emerald to outer space, with Sonic and Tails in
<br />
hot pursuit.  Meanwhile, Metal-Sonic isn't quite dead, and, in his
<br />
damaged state, he sees as his final mission the destruction of Knuckles and
<br />
possession of all remaining Chaos Emeralds.  Guess who wins? :-)
<br />

<br />
Also, I think Tails was given more to do in this game.  You'll notice
<br />
that quite a few of the zones are different if you use Sonic alone than
<br />
if you use Sonic &amp; Tails, especially the zone (forgot the name) where
<br />
Sonic is fighting Robotnik in the air, and Tails must fly and carry Sonic
<br />
during the battle.  Granted, he was little more than window dressing in
<br />
Sonic 2, but I do believe they did a better job of integrating him into
<br />
the game with Sonic 3.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Personally, I don't think there's a thing wrong with that, but I suppose 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; a movie for American audiences ought to look more American.  Perhaps, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though, the Japanese should do a Sonic anime which I can have my local 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; anime club import...  (;3
</em><br />
Oh, if only...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But I thought DIC was partly Japanese...
</em><br />
Prob'ly in the way that many cartoon companies (including the
<br />
makers of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;) often farm certain animation tasks to overseas
<br />
firms to cut costs...doesn't necessarily mean that the overseas boys have
<br />
anything to do with the story or artwork itself.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Um... by the way, why is everyone so sure that a movie is in the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; planning? Shouldn't we first try to find out if it's really true?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Good point.  (:3  Anyone want to take up the challenge?
</em><br />
Very good point, since this came from the same mail-page that was giving
<br />
opinions about when the video game &quot;Sonic 5&quot; was going to come out.
<br />
&quot;Sonic 5&quot;?!??  I'm sorry, but if S+K is being considered as &quot;Sonic 4&quot;,
<br />
then how come Sonic Spinball wasn't called &quot;Sonic 3&quot;, thereby throwing
<br />
the entire numbering system out of whack!  And, of course, with the usual 
<br />
uncertainty about upcoming mini-series or when new characters will make
<br />
their first appearance...we definitely need to find another source about
<br />
this movie thing.  Keep your fingers crossed.
<br />
