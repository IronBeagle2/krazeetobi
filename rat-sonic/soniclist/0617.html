&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 6
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy and Sally followed Uncle Chuck into the hut.  Sonic
<br />
and Bunnie were inside already, and Rotor and Antoine were busy
<br />
bringing items into the hut from the porch.  A small mountain of
<br />
flowers was growing near the foot of the bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was Bunnie's idea,&quot; Uncle Chuck said.  &quot;Now that we have
<br />
a better idea of what's happening to your mother, Bunnie thought
<br />
she might appreciate seeing some of the things left for her.&quot; 
<br />
Indeed, Queen Alicia, though still weak and pale, was genuinely
<br />
touched by the tributes left for her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What IS happening to her, Uncle Chuck?&quot; Sally asked.  Uncle
<br />
Chuck paused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before I explain, you have to understand I only invented
<br />
the roboticizer to enable older folks to live longer lives; I
<br />
certainly never meant for them to cheat death.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does that have to do with it?&quot; Sandy asked
<br />
impatiently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I actually had the basic process worked out a year before I
<br />
finally rejected it--and a year before Robotnik began using it
<br />
for his own purposes.  I spent almost that whole year working on
<br />
one aspect of the process: bioscreening.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bioscreening?&quot;  Sally asked.  &quot;What's that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A roboticized body isn't entirely mechanical.  What the
<br />
roboticization process does is to reconstruct mechanical analogs
<br />
to some of the failed body systems, such as wasted limbs, and use
<br />
other systems that are still functioning without replacing them. 
<br />
The heart continues to function, serving as an electric motor
<br />
once it's been adapted; the brain continues to function as well,
<br />
though it appears that the penetration of the brain by the
<br />
mechanical components had a lot to do with destroying a person's
<br />
will.  That's why I ultimately gave up on the notion of
<br />
roboticization.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But the body of someone who's been roboticized becomes like
<br />
any other machine: it performs mechanical functions and those
<br />
functions produce waste products.  I found that the early
<br />
roboticizing process produced many unwanted elements, and unless
<br />
they were dealt with....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unless they were dealt with,&quot; Rotor spoke up, &quot;they'd have
<br />
nowhere to go except back into the body!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's right.   And...and that's what's killing the Queen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It suddenly became very quiet inside the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik must have used an earlier version of the process;
<br />
either that, or he simply removed the bioscreening capabilities
<br />
from a later design.  Either way,...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind all that!&quot; Sandy snapped.  &quot;Exactly what's
<br />
killing our mother?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's...there are so many things,&quot; Uncle Chuck sighed. 
<br />
&quot;She's suffering from irregular heart rhythms caused by
<br />
electrical interference, her lungs are full of tumors caused by
<br />
toxins, her liver has been poisoned by heavy metals...there's
<br />
just too much....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy turned on her heels, hurled a chair across the hut,
<br />
and before the last splinter fell to the floor she was gone. 
<br />
Sally rose to follow her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Better let her be, Sally girl,&quot; Bunnie said softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You stay, too, Bunnie.  This is your problem as well.&quot; 
<br />
Uncle Chuck's words rooted Bunnie to the spot.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You and Sandy are in the same position as the Queen, though
<br />
not to the same extent.  The blood samples I took from both of
<br />
you confirm it: you're being affected by the same thing that's
<br />
affecting the Queen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is there a...&quot; Bunnie started to ask.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A cure?  If caught early enough, yes.  The technology to
<br />
detoxify your body is readily available.  Unfortunately, so long
<br />
as you're part-robot, you'll only wind up 're-infecting'
<br />
yourself, as it were.  Unless you were deroboticized, it would
<br />
only be a matter of time before your body started breaking down
<br />
from the stress.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And Mother?&quot; Sally asked.  Uncle Chuck shook his head
<br />
slightly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; Sonic asked, &quot;are you saying that anyone
<br />
who's been roboticized is going to go through this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's about the size of it, Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No way!  I mean, YOU were roboticized yourself and you're
<br />
not....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever else Sonic had to say died on his lips.  Uncle
<br />
Chuck looked at his nephew with robotic eyes, eyes that still
<br />
showed a great deal of pain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonie, I didn't want to say anything because I didn't fully
<br />
understand what was going on and I didn't want to scare you, but
<br />
I've felt myself starting to slow down lately.  Not a lot, but
<br />
enough to notice.  At first I thought it was just my age catching
<br />
up to me, but....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonie, listen to me!  I had Nicole run a model of the
<br />
progression of this...this disease or whatever you want to call
<br />
it.  Based on what she said, and after analyzing my own blood
<br />
sample, I've still got about three more good years left in me
<br />
before....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Uncle Chuck, no,&quot; Sally whispered.  She walked up to
<br />
him and put her arms around him.  Then she asked, &quot;What about the
<br />
others?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole estimates that within five years...&quot;  He couldn't
<br />
finish the sentence.  Rotor grabbed a chair and Uncle Chuck sat
<br />
down heavily.  &quot;Within five years, anywhere from a third to one
<br />
half of the roboticized Mobians will be dead or dying.  Inside of
<br />
ten years, nobody who was fully roboticized will be left.&quot;  The
<br />
silence in the hut deepened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What have I done?&quot; Uncle Chuck wailed, burying his face in
<br />
his hands, &quot;what have I done?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the faintest of whispers that caught his attention. 
<br />
The Queen was calling his name.  He approached Queen Alicia and
<br />
knelt next to her bed.  The Queen placed her hand on his own.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not...your fault.  This...is Julian's evil.  It is
<br />
not...your fault.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie turned and left the hut in a daze.  She wandered out
<br />
toward the river that ran next to Knothole, and the bridge that
<br />
spanned it.  She could see someone standing at the middle of the
<br />
bridge, looking down at the flowing water.  It was Sandy.  Bunnie
<br />
walked over to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You OK, Sandy?&quot; she asked.  Sandy didn't say anything for a
<br />
minute, until she drew back her cloak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You see this scar tissue, just where the robot arm ends?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh huh.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One day, when I must have been about eight years old, I
<br />
felt that the Nomad children had called me 'monster hand' for the
<br />
last time.  I snuck a knife out of one of the tents, took it with
<br />
me to a secluded spot, and started cutting my arm off.  I bit my
<br />
lip raw trying not to scream out from the pain.  I never finished
<br />
the job; I passed out from loss of blood, and that's how they
<br />
found me.  They told me I almost died that day; I told them I
<br />
wished I had.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned.  &quot;Bunnie, I don't know how you manage to keep
<br />
from killing yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie didn't answer, because she didn't have an answer. 
<br />
Mercifully, she was spared from having to answer the question,
<br />
for Tails walked up to her.  He looked unusually sullen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somethin' the matter, honey?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just don't know why everyone's acting so strange, Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.  I mean, I know that it's sad that the Queen's gonna die,
<br />
but how come everybody's so weirded out about it?  It's....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scary, right?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; he said in a near-whisper, glad that someone else
<br />
could talk about the feeling he wasn't about to admit himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie thought for a few seconds.  &quot;Maybe Ah can explain it.
<br />
You remember what happened last winter, when Sonic had to stay
<br />
with Antoine until he could get his place rebuilt after Dulcy
<br />
landed on it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah!&quot; Tails laughed.  &quot;Antoine really got bent out of
<br />
shape!  You could hear him yelling at Sonic all over Knothole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's 'cuz Antoine got used to livin' a certain way, and
<br />
when he had to get used to Sonic's way of livin', he couldn't
<br />
handle it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what's that got to do with the way everyone's been
<br />
acting?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, honey, we all of us get used to life, and when we're
<br />
reminded that we're all gonna have to stop livin' one day, then
<br />
it's our turn to get bent out of shape.  See what Ah mean?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think so.  Thanks, Aunt Bunnie.&quot;  He smiled, kissed
<br />
Bunnie on the cheek, and was off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why 'Aunt Bunnie?'&quot; Sandy asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, that's jes' what he calls me, same as he calls Sally
<br />
'Aunt Sally.'&quot;  Bunnie paused.  &quot;Y'know, Sandy, that may be the
<br />
answer to your question.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you can see we're not like any fancy kinda army here.
<br />
It feels more like...like a family.  After all, we all lost our
<br />
real families when Robotnik took over and roboticized 'em.  We
<br />
don't have any kin of our own left, so we have to be kin to each
<br />
other.  Ah think that's what keeps us going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see.  Well, maybe I'll find something to keep *me*
<br />
going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah hope so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll excuse me, I'm going for a walk.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy walked to the end of the bridge, then turned and began
<br />
walking along the bank of the river.  She studied the bank
<br />
intently, as if looking for something.  Occasionally she would
<br />
reach into the water and pull out a small stone from the river
<br />
bed.  The first few stones she tossed back into the water. 
<br />
Finally, she found one that suited some purpose of hers.  Sitting
<br />
on the riverbank, she pulled out her knife and slowly and
<br />
methodically began running the stone against the blade.  She
<br />
didn't stop until the blade was as sharp as a scalpel.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
<br />
