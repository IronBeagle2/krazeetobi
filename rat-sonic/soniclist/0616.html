&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 5
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Silently, the two sisters walked past the curious crowds of
<br />
freedom fighters who had gathered about the hut.  &quot;Please,&quot; Sally
<br />
said to them, &quot;this is something we have to do alone.  You
<br />
understand.&quot;  The freedom fighters murmurred in assent and let
<br />
them pass.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally led her sister, in silence, to a small clearing.  Just
<br />
beyond, barely visible through the brush, was a pool of water. 
<br />
Beneath this was the source of the power rings that gave Sonic
<br />
the added velocity he needed at times.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was the farthest thing from the minds of the two
<br />
sisters as they entered the clearing.  Before them was a mound of
<br />
earth, at one end of which a simple stone of memory had been
<br />
placed.  It was the only such mound in the clearing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My mentor, Julayla,&quot; Sally said simply.  &quot;She was a good
<br />
teacher; I didn't appreciate until much later that she was also a
<br />
good friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You were right, this *is* a good place.  We'd better
<br />
begin.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two began tearing at the grass, uprooting it and
<br />
removing dirt by the handfulls.  As they worked, they talked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did Mother ever say why we were split up, Sandy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It wasn't her idea, or Father's from what she could tell. 
<br />
He was talked into it by Karack, governor of the Southern
<br />
Provinces.  He was that 'swine' that Rosie mentioned.  Because
<br />
the South took so much punishment during the Great War, leaving
<br />
Mobotropolis relatively untouched for most of the fighting, and
<br />
because Karack passed himself off as a militarty genius, Father
<br />
apparently trusted his judgment.  Maybe if Father had been more
<br />
of a skeptic all this never would have happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyway, Karack reasoned with Father that the royal family
<br />
needed to be split up for 'security reasons.'  He must have
<br />
convinced Father that, if the royal family stayed together, we
<br />
could all be wiped out in a single attack.  So Father approved of
<br />
the plan.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;At first, Mother told me, it wasn't such a hardship to be
<br />
separated from Father.  I suppose looking after an infant took
<br />
much of her time.  But she said she also wrote many letters to
<br />
Father.  I don't think any of them ever reached Father, or if
<br />
they did, they were altered to say what Karack wanted them to
<br />
say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So long as Karack could present himself as a successful
<br />
governor in a combat zone, he had Father's ear.  That made it all
<br />
the easier when Karack brought his protege to court with a
<br />
petition that he be installed in the War Ministry: Julian.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So this Karack and Robotnik were on the same side all
<br />
along?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently.  It's hard to say who thought he was in control
<br />
of whom.  Karack must have been sure he had Julian on a short
<br />
leash; we've seen what Julian was capable of doing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was four years old when the experiments began.  Mother
<br />
began to be sick a lot; I'm not certain but I think Julian was
<br />
arranging to have someone taint her food so she'd have to be
<br />
taken someplace for treatments.  All I knew was that someone
<br />
would come to take her away, they'd lock me in my room, and
<br />
nobody would let me out no matter how much I pounded on the door
<br />
or screamed.  Only when she was back in her room would they let
<br />
me out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You sound as if you were being held prisoner.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We were; there's no other way to explain it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And Father never suspected anything?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently not; Karack must have let a couple of letters
<br />
get through--enough to put his mind at ease.  So he had no way of
<br />
knowing what was happening to us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One day, Mother was brought back in and I was let into her
<br />
room.  She was unconscious, and when I tried to move her, the
<br />
covering slipped off her bed, where she'd been placed.  I...I
<br />
can't begin to describe what I felt when I saw what they'd done
<br />
to her left foot.  I thought they'd chopped off her real one and
<br />
put a metal one in its place.  I was panicked and screaming when
<br />
two bots came into the room.  They took me to a laboratory of
<br />
some sort.  After that everything was a blur except for
<br />
Julian...and that look on his face!  I woke up back in the room
<br />
where Mother and I were being held.  My right hand had been
<br />
roboticized.  The forearm and upper arm came later on two
<br />
different occasions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;From that time on we were treated as prisoners, without
<br />
even the pretense of civilized treatment.  From our window we
<br />
could see shipments of bots coming in, as Julian prepared for
<br />
some kind of assault.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then the day came when Julian had us brought to the throne
<br />
room.  He said he was going to 'tie together some loose ends.' 
<br />
The first one he took care of was Karack.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me guess: Robotnik had him roboticized.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik knew all along what kind of petty opportunist he
<br />
was up against in Karack.  He would have done Karack a favor by
<br />
roboticizing him.  After he was done, Robotnik didn't leave
<br />
enough of Karack to pour into one of your boots.  He made Mother
<br />
and I watch what happened--I still wake up screaming sometimes,
<br />
thinking about it.  Then he ordered us returned to our room.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So how did you ever escape?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It wasn't easy.  We were under surveillance every minute of
<br />
every day.  Ironically, it was Robotnik who made our escape
<br />
possible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The residents of the capitol thought they were safe because
<br />
of Karack's dealings with Robotnik, but they were wrong.  With
<br />
Karack out of the way, Robotnik had no more use for the city.  He
<br />
brought in SWAT-bots and began destroying the whole place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't have any clear memories of what happened, but
<br />
Mother told me that we were being escorted down a hallway by a
<br />
couple of Karack's guards when the palace was rocked by some kind
<br />
of explosion--we could never learn exactly what had happened. 
<br />
Anyway, in that one moment, the guards panicked and fled, more
<br />
worried about saving their own lives than watching us.  That was
<br />
all the chance Mother needed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother had been born in the Southern Provinces and had
<br />
wintered in the palace as a child.  So she knew every inch of the
<br />
place, including tunnels and passages nobody was supposed to know
<br />
about. She opened one of these and we went inside.  That was the
<br />
first time I heard the sound of SWAT-bots.  They were coming down
<br />
the hallway, then I could hear the sound of their footsteps
<br />
fading as they headed off in the direction of our room.  I'm sure
<br />
they were under orders to execute us.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We moved along the corridor.  It was darker than night in
<br />
there, but Mother held me and whispered that I should be very
<br />
quiet.  I could only feel myself being carried onward and
<br />
downward, down what felt like a descending pathway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No sooner had we reached what felt like the botton of the
<br />
path and a stretch of level tunnel than the ground above us
<br />
began shaking violently.  I remember screaming, then dirt raining
<br />
down on top of me.  Next thing I knew, I was outside of the city,
<br />
in the moonlight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother told me later what had happened: bombs had been
<br />
placed in select areas of the city and the palace, with the
<br />
military bots--now called SWATbots--holding the people captive in
<br />
several predetermined locations.  Robotnik apparently got away
<br />
after giving the order for the SWATbots to detonate the bombs. 
<br />
That's how the palace, the capitol and the people were destroyed. 
<br />
It didn't matter to Robotnik that he lost a number of his
<br />
SWATbots--maybe he thought it would look more like a military
<br />
strike that way.  Maybe half a dozen Mobians survived the blast
<br />
through some twist of fate or other.  Mother and I survived only
<br />
because we were underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We came up through an opening that led to the outskirts of
<br />
the city; the city itself appeared to be deserted except for the
<br />
bodies.  We were too much in shock at the time to know what to do
<br />
or where to go.  We found a house that was still relatively
<br />
intact and fell asleep.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The next morning we woke to find ourselves surrounded by
<br />
Nomads--apparently they'd come to scavenge the city or what was
<br />
left of it.  Because Mother still had some of her jewels with
<br />
her, including a brooch studded with gems that was a wedding
<br />
present from Father--that's the one I gave Bunnie to show to 
<br />
you--and because Mother knew a great deal about the Nomads'
<br />
language and customs, we bargained our way onto the caravan.  And
<br />
we travelled with the Nomads from that day forward, hiding our
<br />
identities when SWATbot patrols came around.  When we heard that
<br />
Mobotropolis had been taken and the populace roboticized, it
<br />
seemed pointless to go back anyway.  We got used to that life,
<br />
but it cost us dearly: we lost all hope that things would ever be
<br />
as they were.  And then we ran into Dirk and heard about you.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think that's it,&quot; she said as she wiped the dirt from her
<br />
hands.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So do I.  Let's go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sandy left the clearing, their task accomplished. 
<br />
Sally still had hopes that Uncle Chuck might find a way to
<br />
miraculously cure their mother.  In the meantime, they had acted
<br />
in accordance with Mobian custom: they had, with their bare
<br />
hands, dug their mother's grave.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They returned to Knothole just as Uncle Chuck stepped out of
<br />
Sally's hut.  Sally, despite the physical and emotional
<br />
exhaustion she felt, ran toward him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Any news, Uncle Chuck?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but I'm afraid it's not good.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
