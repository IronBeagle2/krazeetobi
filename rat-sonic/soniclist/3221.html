Hi again . 
<br />

<br />
Today I have a few things to talk about :
<br />

<br />
1)My Archives
<br />
2)New Fan Fiction
<br />
3)A reply to that thing about a review on Sonic X-treme
<br />

<br />
1) My Archives
<br />

<br />
As you all know , I run the Sonic Fan Fiction Archives . To date this is
<br />
what I've recieved :
<br />

<br />
New Fan Fiction : 1
<br />
Votes for favorite fan fiction : 0
<br />
Decipher : 1
<br />

<br />
Both the things I've recieved came from the same person , the fan fiction
<br />
was forwarded to me from another person .
<br />

<br />
Anyway , I cannot believe that no one has completed any fan fics that have
<br />
NOT been posted on the net . Surely someone has something they want displayed .
<br />
I made this archive to create a place where authors can display their works
<br />
, but my archives seem to be turning into a showcase for my own fan fics
<br />
only ...
<br />
This only boils down to a few possibilities :
<br />

<br />
a) No one knows about my archives
<br />
b) No one can be bothered with my archives
<br />
c) No one has fan fiction
<br />
d) No one has completed any fan fiction recently 
<br />

<br />
All I can say is .... please...please (I'm grovelling here..) send me your
<br />
fan fiction . Without your support , there is no point to the Fan Fiction
<br />
Archives .
<br />
Perhaps as a start , those of you working on fan fics could let me know that
<br />
you are ? No details needed , just a sentence saying that you are working on
<br />
something and when it is expected to be completed . In advance ,
<br />
thankyouthankyouthankyou . :)

<br />

<br />
2) New Fan Fiction 
<br />
Here it is : I've posted two new fan fictions to the Fan Fiction Archives .
<br />
One is written by me , the other is written by a Fred Richards , which was
<br />
forwarded to me by Kiken Enryu yesterday . 
<br />

<br />
Here's the description :
<br />

<br />
Tell Tale Hell  -  by Fred Richards
<br />

<br />
This story is set in the Robotnik era , and covers stuff about Packbell ,
<br />
under orders from Robotnik , experimenting to create a powerful biological
<br />
lifeform cum weapon . 
<br />

<br />
Power of the Mind  -  by me
<br />

<br />
This story continues from Tides of War , in the As the Wheel Turns series of
<br />
fan fics . It will tell of the efforts of the Council of the Federated Races
<br />
to find the traitor in it's ranks that had enabled Queen (and President)
<br />
Sally's capture by the forces of the Alliance of Races . What they find out
<br />
however seems impossible to believe ...
<br />

<br />
As before , you can also e-mail me for a personal copy of MY fanfics . If
<br />
you really cannot get the fanfics of others on my archive , send a note my
<br />
way , and I'll do what I can . Look for the e-mail address in my signature
<br />
below .
<br />

<br />
3) Reply
<br />

<br />
OK , now for the last part . 
<br />
The magazine Electronic Gaming Monthly's May issue (we just got it here in
<br />
Singapore , and I'm not sure how long ago it was released elsewhere ) had a
<br />
half page article on what they call &quot; Super Sonic &quot; , the working title for
<br />
the Sonic game on the Saturn . They say the release date is in Fall , it is
<br />
action themed , and is 25% complete . The game is in 3D , and will either be
<br />
rendered , like the arcade game , or polygon-based like the Sonic Fighting
<br />
Game . EGM also said that Sega would not comment further until the E3 trade
<br />
show . 
<br />

<br />
I've said my share .
<br />

<br />
That's all for now .
<br />

<br />
Later
