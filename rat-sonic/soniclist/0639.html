WHAT'S NEW?:
<br />
[Note: by suggestion of Ron Bauerle, I will be posting all new
<br />
material in this portion of the FAQ File, to keep people from
<br />
having to wade through the whole thing.  After a week, though, it
<br />
gets cut-and-pasted into the body of the File.  There WILL be
<br />
spoilers.  You have been warned.   DJD]
<br />

<br />
#22 [May 1995]
<br />
&quot;The Return,&quot; written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &amp;
<br />
Harvey M.
<br />

<br />
The story opens with Sonic &amp; Sally MCW (Married with Children;
<br />
cf. the end of &quot;Sally's Quest&quot; in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &amp;
<br />
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
<br />
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
<br />
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
<br />
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
<br />
talking with Robo-Robotnik from &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics,&quot;
<br />
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
<br />
(hereinafter &quot;R-R&quot;) remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
<br />
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
<br />
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
<br />
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
<br />
&quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; himself to keep from being ruler over
<br />
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: &quot;You owe
<br />
me!&quot;  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
<br />
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
<br />
artwork.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tails Knighttime Story,&quot; written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
<br />
Manak &amp; John Dagostino.
<br />

<br />
As Tails grumps about &quot;get[ting] baby-sat&quot; while Sonic has all
<br />
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
<br />
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who &quot;borrows&quot; his
<br />
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
<br />
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
<br />
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
<br />

<br />
Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
<br />
pepper them with questions (most are answered: &quot;Keep reading.&quot; 
<br />
Translation: &quot;we're working on it!&quot;).  The cover of Princess
<br />
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
<br />
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the &quot;creative
<br />
differences&quot; theory in Q7.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
[I am indebted to R.D.B. for the following, since the Sally
<br />
miniseries has yet to hit the shelves in this corner of Michigan-
<br />
-I've GOT to stop buying retail and subscribe!]
<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
<br />

<br />
&quot;Deadliest of the Species!&quot; written by Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken
<br />
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski.
<br />

<br />
Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
<br />
describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is renouned for
<br />
his military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
<br />
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.
<br />

<br />
Sally &amp; Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
<br />
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
<br />
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
<br />
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
<br />
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
<br />
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
<br />
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
<br />
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
<br />
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.
<br />

<br />
The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
<br />
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
<br />
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
<br />
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
<br />
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
<br />
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
<br />
glass case: Sally!?
<br />

<br />
Also some fan art: two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie (both NBD), and one
<br />
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
<br />
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
<br />
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
<br />
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
<br />
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
<br />
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
<br />
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
<br />
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
<br />
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
<br />
address is princess_at_frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />

<br />
================================================================
<br />

<br />
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
<br />
range from transplantation to mutation.  The latest entry is in
<br />
the Sonicgram of #22.  They state that Tails just happened to be
<br />
born that way--with no other comment (thus illustrating the
<br />
difference between an Explanation and an Answer).  At this point,
<br />
there is no &quot;official&quot; explanation as to how Tails got that way,
<br />
so you're pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally,
<br />
I prefer the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's
<br />
pollution of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails
<br />
had not been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5
<br />
from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has been in charge:
<br />
11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born after the fall of
<br />
the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma
<br />
would be to put the age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of
<br />
18; that would eliminate the extra year differential without
<br />
altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of
<br />
Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differed in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
featured Geoffrey St. John, while another did not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
<br />
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  Two
<br />
different versions of the cover for #2 appeared in Sonic #22. 
<br />
The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS
<br />
Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series
<br />
(as reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to
<br />
indicate that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative
<br />
differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally miniseries began
<br />
shipping the week of Feb 13.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.   First Season: 1993-94
<br />

<br />
Super Sonic
<br />
Writer: Jules Dennis
<br />
When Nicole malfunctions, Sonic and Sally go to Robotropolis to
<br />
get replacement parts.  While there, they discover the Forbidden
<br />
Zone and a being named Lezar.  Lezar causes Sonic to lose his
<br />
speed abilities, and teaches him that he can still accomplish
<br />
things without it.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Boom
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
While on a mission in Robotropolis, Sally intercepts a message
<br />
which includes the use of her father's pet name for her.  They
<br />
follow the lead to the Dark Swamp and the remains of Ironlock
<br />
Prison.  In the process, a freedom fighter named Cat is captured.
<br />

<br />
The freedom fighters gain maps to Robotropolis, but the search
<br />
for Sally's father proves futile.
<br />

<br />
Sonic and Sally
<br />
Writers: Pat Allee and Ben Hurst
<br />
Before becoming the principle writers for the second season,
<br />
Allee and Hurst wrote this account of Sally's capture by
<br />
Robotnik's forces.  Sonic rescues what he thinks is Sally but
<br />
what is instead a robot double.  Back in Knothole, Tails begins
<br />
to doubt Sally's behavior because of small details, such as how
<br />
she reads a bedtime story.  After first dismissing Tails' fears,
<br />
Sonic also comes to realizes he's been dealing with a &quot;Stepford
<br />
Sally.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Hooked on Sonics
<br />
Writer: Randy Rogel
<br />
In an attempt to impress Sally, Antoine tries to capture Robotnik
<br />
by himself.  He attempts to lure Robotnik into the open with the
<br />
offer of a power ring, but Antoine is himself captured and Sonic
<br />
has to rescue him.
<br />

<br />
Ultra Sonic
<br />
Writer: David Villaire
<br />
While on a raid in Robotropolis, Sonic finds his Uncle Chuck as a
<br />
robot worker in a crystal mine.  Uncle Chuck recovers his mind
<br />
and will long enough to help destroy a giant crystal which would
<br />
have damaged the ecosystem of the entire planet.  As Uncle Chuck
<br />
loses control of his will, Sonic vows to return for him.
<br />

<br />
Sonic's Nightmare
<br />
Writer: Frank Santopadre
<br />
The freedom fighters are captured and held on a deserted island
<br />
refinery.  Sonic must not only rescue them but he also has to
<br />
deal with a recurring nightmare where he unable to prevent
<br />
Sally's being roboticized.
<br />

<br />
Warp Sonic
<br />
Writer: Matt Uitz
<br />
The freedom fighters discover an underground civilization called
<br />
Lower Mobius and one of its citizens, Griff.  Lower Mobius draws
<br />
energy from a power crystal, but it is weakening.  Feigning
<br />
friendship, Griff visits Knothole and steals the power stone
<br />
which is the source of the power rings.  After fighting off some
<br />
mechanical rats, the power stone is retrieved.  Griff apologizes
<br />
for his theft and is given a portion of the stone to aid Lower
<br />
Mobius.
<br />

<br />
Harmonic Sonic
<br />
Writer: David Villaire
<br />
After Robotnik launches a robot-manned orbiting space station to
<br />
locate Knothole, the Knothole freedom fighters use a rocket
<br />
booster to reach and destroy it.
<br />

<br />
Sonic and the Secret Scrolls
<br />
Writer: Janis Diamond
<br />
The freedom fighters journey to Mauga (sp?) to recover some
<br />
legendary scrolls, but Robotnik is tailing them.  Robotnik's ship
<br />
is hurled off a plateau by a violent wind, and the Knothole gang
<br />
mistakenly believe he is finished.  Will they make the same
<br />
mistake at the end of the second season?
<br />

<br />
Sub-Sonic
<br />
Writer: Barbara Slade
<br />
Sonic discovers a stream of water that makes plants grow at a
<br />
fantastic rate.  In their search for the source, the Knothole
<br />
gang discover a subterranean creature whose habitat has been
<br />
disturbed by Robotnik's drilling operations.
<br />

<br />
Heads or Tails
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
<br />
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
<br />
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
<br />
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
<br />
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing
<br />
Knothole.  Artwork in this ep is decidedly off-model.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Past Cool
<br />
Writers: Kayte Kuch &amp; Sheryl Scarborough
<br />
Tails finds a baby terrapod and the freedom fighters escort the
<br />
terrapod herd to Boulder Bay, where they will be safe from
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sonic Racer
<br />
Writer: Len Janson
<br />
While on a mission to disable Robotnik's power generators, Sonic
<br />
is tempted into participating in a contest against a super-fast
<br />
robot designed to capture him.  While he engages the bot, Bunnie,
<br />
Sally and Antoine go after their target: Robotnik's back-up
<br />
generator.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.   Second Season: 1994-95
<br />

<br />
Game Guy
<br />
Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
<br />
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
<br />
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
<br />
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
<br />
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
<br />
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
<br />
about a list of other freedom fighters.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Conversion
<br />
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
<br />
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
<br />
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
<br />
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
<br />
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
<br />
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
<br />
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
<br />
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.
<br />

<br />
No Brainer
<br />
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
<br />
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
<br />
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
<br />
wears off just as the Knothole gang face imminent capture.
<br />

<br />
Blast to the Past (two parts)
<br />
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
<br />
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
<br />
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
<br />
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
<br />
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
<br />
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
<br />
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
<br />
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
<br />
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
<br />
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
would not get captured.
<br />

<br />
Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
<br />
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made &quot;king&quot;
<br />
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
<br />
&quot;honor&quot; of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
<br />
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
<br />
ineptitude.
<br />

<br />
Dulcy
<br />
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
<br />
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
<br />
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
<br />
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
<br />
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
<br />
time to hatch the egg.
<br />

<br />
The Void
<br />
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the &quot;Great
<br />
Unknown&quot; [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
<br />
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
<br />
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
<br />
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
<br />
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
<br />
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
<br />
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
<br />
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
<br />
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
<br />
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
<br />
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
<br />
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
<br />
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
<br />
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.
<br />

<br />
The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
<br />
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
<br />
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
<br />
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
<br />
for Antoine.
<br />

<br />
Cry of the Wolf
<br />
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
<br />
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
<br />
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
<br />
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
<br />
a lightning storm and destroys it.
<br />

<br />
Drood Henge
<br />
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
<br />
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
<br />
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
<br />
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
<br />
can get to it.
<br />

<br />
Spyhog
<br />
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
<br />
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
<br />
back underground with a different cover.
<br />

<br />
Doomsday
<br />
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
<br />
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
<br />
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
<br />
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
<br />
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
<br />
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
<br />
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
<br />
him?  We'll never know: ABC chose not to run StH for a third
<br />
season.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
<br />

<br />
[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />

<br />
#18 [Jan 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
<br />
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
<br />
plans an attack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;
<br />
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
<br />
&quot;First Star....&quot;, #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
<br />
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
<br />
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork
<br />

<br />
Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally's Crusade: The Quest&quot;
<br />
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
<br />
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
<br />
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
<br />
spelled out in a &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of the story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mirror Zone&quot;
<br />
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as &quot;about 15.&quot;  [Note, if
<br />
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Tallest Tale&quot;
<br />
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
<br />
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
<br />
Shaw!.
<br />

<br />
#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.
<br />

<br />
#20 [Mar 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
<br />
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): &quot;Give Mobius
<br />
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;
<br />
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
<br />
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
<br />
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.
<br />

<br />
#21 [Apr 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;3 Phases of E.V.E&quot;
<br />
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
<br />
E.V.E. [&quot;exceptionally versatile evolvoid&quot;] to capture Sonic.  As
<br />
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
<br />
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
<br />
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
<br />
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
<br />
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
<br />
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
<br />
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
<br />
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
<br />
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
<br />
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
<br />
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
<br />
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
<br />
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
<br />
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
<br />
conflicts with &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; and, in fact, the rest of the
<br />
second season.
