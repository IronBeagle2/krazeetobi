Seeing how this poster has publically dragged me through the mud (again), my 
<br />
response is necessitated.  As Ratman has written his own responses, I am 
<br />
not responding to points not aimed against me unless I am asked by him to 
<br />
do otherwise.

</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; move on the part of Eric, which was to utilize a posting of mine in order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to set down a new `list rule'.  What transpired was that in the beginning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; of my fanfic-writing career, I made it a habit to publish my stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; on the mailing list directly, and then have Bookshire grep them from his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mailspool and HTMLize it for fanfic-page consumption.  I had not seen a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; single post on said list about anyone disliking my practice of doing this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and had, in fact, recieved a few positive comments.  This not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; encouragedme to continue my writings, but it also gave me a mandate to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; continue this practice further.  Well, after I had sent one of my stories 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the list on one fateful afternoon, Eric decided to take the opportunity 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to put down a new list rule.  Can anyone tell me what it is?  No?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it was that no further stories were to be sent to the list.  He used 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the header of my posting, deleted all of the content of the message (even 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the `On such-and-such day, X said:' line), and said in no uncertain terms that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; no further fanfic was to be sent to the list.  That's all.  No `good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story, Joe', no `awful story, Joe', no `nice paragraphing, Joe', but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; instead a subtle incrimination that it was -MY- fault that this new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; policy was being instituted.  Real fucking nice, man.  Yet, I kept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my mouth closed, and instead did what I was instructed to.  The deep-rooted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; indignation that I possess now was absent in me then, so I meekly shut up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and obeyed.
</em><br />

<br />
It was not my decision to disallow posting of stories.
<br />

<br />
Last summer, Ratman firmly decided against posting binary files.  I had 
<br />
no problem with this and implemented the policy accordingly right away.  
<br />
My interpretation of &quot;no binaries&quot; was that story postings would be 
<br />
allowed as they were text postings whereas a .JPG or .GIF is 
<br />
unquestionably binary.  November 1995 is when Ratman expanded the policy 
<br />
to disallow posting of stories.  I did argue my interpretation to him in 
<br />
direct mail, but as this is his server, I ultimately had to implement his 
<br />
wishes promptly.
<br />

<br />
I saw you say on Sociopolitical Ramifications that I posted my 
<br />
administrative message to you to the list.  This is absolutely false.  I 
<br />
immediately double-checked my message and confirmed that it was sent to 
<br />
you directly.  You didn't know I was in the same room because I was 
<br />
Guest1 at that time.
<br />

<br />
You never saw my discussions of this issue with Ratman because it was in 
<br />
private mail with him.  Did you ever try to correspond with me in private 
<br />
mail?  No; not one message.  I keep everything in my sent-mail folder for 
<br />
3 weeks so I could have forwarded these messages to you upon request, and 
<br />
you could have authenticated them with Ratman.
<br />

<br />
But instead of using e-mail, you chose to make threats against me on 
<br />
FurToonia.  Very few people know who my FT character is, so I bet you 
<br />
never knew I was in the same room with you.  Ever since then, I knew I 
<br />
made the right decision to abandon my former character Toby in late 
<br />
October 1995 and be secretive about my character.
<br />

<br />
The decision was made before you posted your story, and was temporarily 
<br />
mired in differences in interpretation not resolved until just prior to 
<br />
your posting.  Call it bad luck, call it bad timing, but do not call it a 
<br />
conspiracy against you.  Had you asked me or Ratman about it in a 
<br />
civilized private message, you would have known that over 6 months ago.
<br />

<br />
As for not commenting on your story, I did not do so because I sent my
<br />
non-public message to you before reading it.  My modus operandi has always
<br />
been to tend to administrative needs first, and then respond to posts and
<br />
write new ones.  I would read short posts online, and save the long posts
<br />
for reading offline.  Though I do have SLIP and PPP accounts, I still
<br />
prefer to handle my mail with my shell account.  I could not possibly have
<br />
offered you an opinion of your story at that point in time because, again,
<br />
I had not yet read it.  Had you asked me about it in a civilized private
<br />
message, you would have known that over 6 months ago. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;      However, my ire was rose when people CONTINUED, -TOTALLY- unflamed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to post fanfic to the list (and multi-part fanfic, I might add) and were,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; in fact, APPLAUDED by the admins!
</em><br />

<br />
I very seldom posted administrative warnings to the list.  I feel there 
<br />
is no need to embarrass someone with a public scolding and no one else on 
<br />
the list wants to read such a thing anyway.  I have posted warnings when 
<br />
the situation warranted, but the list archives prove that was 
<br />
infrequent.  I did send warnings just like the one you got to other list 
<br />
subscribers, but you didn't see them because I sent them in private 
<br />
mail.  Had you asked me or Ratman about it in a civilized private 
<br />
message, you would have known that over 6 months ago.
<br />

<br />
I don't recall what Ratman posted that allegedly applauded others' story 
<br />
postings, but I never did any such thing.  The list archives prove it.
