Hello All, Dan asked what the game would be like.. so here I go!
<br />

<br />
The game type I was thinking of would be something like syndicate, where you
<br />
see the map from the air. (Kinda like looking down at a doll house at 45degrees)
<br />

<br />
I was thinking of there being seperate freedom fighter parties, (with group
<br />
leaders etc.) You create your character, lets say Dan is a Fox.. a vulpea 
<br />
vulpea (red fox) Right? Okay, now Dan has 35 study points, so before he becomes
<br />
a freedom fighter, he says &quot;Okay, lemme see..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Unarmed Combat:10
<br />
Armed   Combat:20
<br />
Digital System:5
<br />
bla           :0
<br />
bla           :0
<br />
bla           :0
<br />

<br />
Later on as time goes by, he gains more study time, so he can upgrade the
<br />
points.
<br />

<br />
Then he is randomly assigned to a group of furry freedom fighters, Okay.. 
<br />
So Dan ends up in .. the southside freedom pack.
<br />
He gets told a little story, maybe with some good music and Sound Blaster sound,
<br />
as I do have the units to do that. [They're all mine AAHAHAHAH!]
<br />

<br />
The group leader then sees that there is a big mean nasty swat-bot plant, and 
<br />
realises after he loses five of his teams to it that he'd better give someone
<br />
else the Job.. so he puts a message in the out thing.. Of course, someone has to
<br />
deliver the mail in the game. So one guy has to do a mail-mission. [low-risk]
<br />
{By the way, seeing that you won'y know the guys real name Email will be
<br />
useless!}
<br />

<br />
Okay, So now let say Lindsay's team, (Who have developed a Swat-Splat
<br />
laser.. okay too lame name.. a Gravatic Particle Displacer Weapon [GPDW],
<br />
decide to
<br />
do the mission, then Lindsay selects someone to carry it out. That person is
<br />
then given his main character, some guys who go with him. [who by the way aren't
<br />
players.. so if they get killed.. it only effects the team strength, doesn't
<br />
cause some guy who didn't play to get the message.. &quot;You were killed when
<br />
someone else got wasted.. Game Over&quot;]
<br />

<br />
That player, next time he gets his player file, sees that he has a mission, so
<br />
he grabs some coffie and begins. He is given a view like syndicate. hmm,
<br />
lets see how my Asci art looks..
<br />

<br />
*---------------------------*------*
<br />
|                           | NAME |
<br />
|                           | INFO |
<br />
|  /----/|                  |------|
<br />
| /----/ |                  | TEAM |
<br />
| |   |  |                  | INFO |
<br />
| |   | /|                  |      |
<br />
| |   ||/                   |------|
<br />
| |___|/   MAP VIEW         | =3D= |
<br />
|                           | View |
<br />
*---------------------------*------*
<br />

<br />
Okay, how does that look? 
<br />

<br />
The name-Info box would say something like: &quot;Dan the Itchy&quot;, health 43%, stamina
<br />
92%, carrying--Stunned Fox[SAM].
<br />

<br />
Team Info would be all the team members, listed like this.
<br />
Eg.
<br />

<br />
Mark|*CAPTURED*|
<br />
Sam |*STUNNED* |
<br />
Jas |*HACKING* |46%.
<br />
Jon |*LOOKOUT* |SAFE
<br />
Dan |*IDLE*    |
<br />

<br />
Now you could click on any of these, and TADA, you'd go to them. 
<br />

<br />
Okay now the little 3dview box, is kinda like a wolfenstein view, my gaming
<br />
technology level is nearly there, so with any luck, by the time the game is 
<br />
near complete, I should be able to put that feature in.
<br />

<br />
The main view, is the Syndicate/Ufo/WarCraft style view.
<br />

<br />
Other infos: When someone is on lookout, if they see something.. they tell you,
<br />
either over Sb or via a dialog box.
<br />

<br />
Your players don't get killed by swat-bot fire, they get stunned, the swat-bots
<br />
will then try to take them to the swat-bot hover unit. If they succeed at this, 
<br />
then that player is captured. (Course, if you waste em before they get to the
<br />
car.. the stunned guy is all yours.. again.)
<br />

<br />
If players get too close to swat-bots, and aren't in combat mode, they also get
<br />
grabbed, and can be captured.. though you have a certain amount of control 
<br />
over a conscious player who's being carried by a swat.. 
<br />

<br />
'Nuff said.
<br />

<br />
Well, I hope that clears it up.. Anyone have anything more ta say?
<br />

<br />
[Check the Sega job offers, they're looking for an assasin now.]
<br />

<br />
Cheers
<br />
Ablater
