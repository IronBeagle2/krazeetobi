[Sorry if this is a repost, but my mailer screwed up in a way which 
<br />
SOMETIMES means I sent a blank e-mail message]

<br />
Fred Sloniker &lt;lazuli_at_u.washington.edu&gt; asks:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I've got two questions for you Sonic-philes, one game-related, one 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comic/show-related:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (a) Which of the game tunes from Sonics 1, 2, 3, K, CD, et cetera are 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; your absolute favorites?
</em><br />

<br />
Hrm.. I only have Sonic 1, 2, and 3 (I rented S&amp;K though)... 
<br />

<br />
I don't remember much from Sonic 1 since its been a while since I played 
<br />
it.  I think that 'Star Light Zone' is my favorite from that game but
<br />
I'd probably have to listen to them again to make sure.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From Sonic 2, I liked the music from Chemical Plant and Metropolis Zones
</em><br />
the best.  Oil Ocean runs a close third for me... I didn't like it until 
<br />
I 'screwed up' the 'select any level' trick and somehow made the game 
<br />
play the Oil Ocean theme ALL THE TIME (with no other jumping or ring 
<br />
grabbing sounds).  It gave the entire game an eerie feeling.
<br />

<br />
I liked the Sonic 2 'finale' music as well (when the credits are rolling).
<br />

<br />
A friend of mine decided to 'tape' some of the music from Sonic 2 and he
<br />
played it in his car.  Sonic 2's 'bonus round' music was VERY appropriate 
<br />
for the winding road we were on.  Now if there were rings on the road to 
<br />
drive over... wait a minute.. if there's road construction we could've 
<br />
used CONES! :)  [i guess we're lucky there wasn't any road construction]
<br />

<br />
Fom Sonic 3?  Hrm.  I liked several of the scores but there's no question
<br />
about it.  My absolute favorite has to be the 'finale' music (while the 
<br />
credits are rolling).  Its my favorite for all Sonic games I've seen so far.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles... I rented this so I haven't gotten to hear ALL the music
<br />
but my favorites are the Mushroom Hill zone music, and the level with the
<br />
sand and those stupid ghosts.  Another favorite score (when playing Sonic)
<br />
is when Knuckles pops out of his hiding place to check out what's going on
<br />
(RIGHT at the beginning).  Something about this whole beginning sequence 
<br />
practically 'defines' what I like about the world of Sonic. 
<br />

<br />
I haven't seen Chaotix, Triple Trouble, or Sonic CD so I have no opinions
<br />
on these.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (b) What music makes you think of the various members of the Freedom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Fighters and/or the Empire (excuse me, Robotnik's forces)?  I'm
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; particularly looking for something for Tails, whom I haven't quite come up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with the perfect piece for.  Joke names okay ('Do Run Run' for Sonic?),
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but I'm thinking more of music that *sounds* like the character. 
</em><br />

<br />
Hrm... 
<br />

<br />
I'd have to listen to lots of music while thinking about this before I 
<br />
could decide for sure.
<br />

<br />
For Sonic, maybe one of those high speed 'Techno' songs.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Robin Hood suggested:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sir Charles:  &quot;Mr. Roboto&quot; by Styx
</em><br />
Maybe something by Kraftwerk would be better :)
<br />

<br />
David Pistone suggested:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Weird Science&quot; by Oingo Boingo for Rotor. :)
</em><br />
I dunno.. Rotor's not THAT crazy.
<br />

<br />
How about the French National Anthem for Antoine.
<br />

<br />
Christ suggests:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; For Tails it's easy: &quot;Flight of the Valkyries&quot; :)
</em><br />
Yes, I can see it now...  Tails wearing one of those horned Viking helmets
<br />
singing opera.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And with a few slight changes to his DNA, it could be the theme from 
</em><br />
the movie &quot;Airwolf&quot; :):)
<br />
I actually like this suggestion :)  Maybe for an 'adult' Tails though.
<br />
You definitly need something 'cuter' for Tails. :)
<br />

You know... long ago on this list I heard at one time a 'live-action Sonic
<br />
movie' was being considered (but was never made).  I really have to wonder 
<br />
how to 'visualize' such a thing.  Would they dress actors up to 'sorta' 
<br />
look like the characters (e.g. Mario Brother's movie) or would they make 
<br />
Sonic computer animated, or would they use the 'Howard the Duck' approach.
<br />
Would they keep Jameel White (that Urkel guy) as the voice of Sonic?  
<br />
Lately I've been curious about this movie.  [also.. on an unrelated topic..
<br />
wasn't a 'Lost in Space' movie planned?..  What happened to it?]
