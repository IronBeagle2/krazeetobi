<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group, caught completely off guard when the first bolt was fired,
<br />
managed to snap out of it just in time to dodge the second one and scatter,
<br />
splitting the group in two.  Bunnie, Antoine and Tails ran for the cover of
<br />
a tall machine, and Sally, Sonic and Vision hid behind a set of large metal
<br />
boxes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic wiped his brow.  &quot;Oh, man!  So much for getting that thing outta
<br />
here, Vis!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision nodded.  &quot;As well as my plan to destroy it safely... I can
<br />
guarantee there's plenty of more power in that Ry'den star. We're gonna have
<br />
to...&quot; He was interrupted by Robotnik's gloating voice blaring from a set of
<br />
loudspeakers in the room.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, hedgehog, how do you like my new toy?  Impressive, is it not?&quot;
<br />
Robotnik chortled.  &quot;Surrender yourself now, and your fellow Freedom
<br />
Fighters will be given the merciful fate of Roboticization...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally whispered to Vision and Sonic as Robotnik spoke, &quot;he could raze
<br />
all of Mobius with that thing... We have to do _something_...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic interrupted Robotnik by yelling &quot;Go jump into a reactor core,
<br />
Robuttnik!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's blaring voice spoke on. &quot;Well, then, since you've refused
<br />
such a reasonable offer, I've no choice but to _exterminate_ you all!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik laughed maniacally as Packbell added, &quot;And take notice,
<br />
rodents!  If this weapon doesn't take care of you, our SWATBots most
<br />
assuredly will!&quot;  As if on cue, numerous SWATBots began to file into the
<br />
room through the doors, searching for the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic frowned as he heard the clanking metallic footsteps, and snuck a
<br />
quick glance at then machine the other half of the group was hiding behind. 
<br />
Bunnie was holding her own against a pair of SWATBots, as Tails and Antoine
<br />
hid under the machine, Tails handling things a bit more bravely.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man...&quot; Sonic said, turning around to Sally and Vision.  &quot;Outta the
<br />
fryin' pan, into the... LOOK OUT!!&quot; he yelled as two SWATBots appeared
<br />
behind the other two, firing their lasers.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next amazed Sally and Sonic.  Vision zipped behind Sally,
<br />
placing himself between her and Sonic, and the SWATBots, and held up his
<br />
hands, as if to try and block the laser bolts with them.  Surprisingly, he
<br />
succeeds, his hands absorbing the energy of the bolts.  The energy seemed to
<br />
run down his arms, across his back, and back to his hands, discharging in
<br />
two coarse blasts of energy back at the SWATBots, blowing their heads clean
<br />
off.  &quot;Back at'cha, suckers!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both Sonic and Sally stood there, completely stupified, Sonic barely
<br />
managing to emit a quiet &quot;Whoa...&quot; as Vision dragged the two defunct
<br />
SWATBots over.  &quot;It's a Keld'yrian thing.&quot; Vision said to Sonic, grinning.
<br />
He then looked at Sally and shook her gently.  &quot;C'mon, Sally, snap out of
<br />
it.  We still need ya here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blinked and snapped out of her daze. &quot;Uh, right... How can we
<br />
destroy that thing, Vision?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...&quot; he replied, ripping the back panels off the SWATBots, and
<br />
sticking his hands in each of them.  he began to glow as he absorbed
<br />
electricity from their batteries.  &quot;My other plan for destroying it is a bit
<br />
more risky... I'll need you, Blue Boy, to provide a distraction while I make
<br />
my way to that platform Crazy Ivo's on.  Then, on my signal, you toss me one
<br />
of your Power Rings, and I'll...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa! Waitaminit!!&quot;  Sonic said, with some suspicion.  &quot;You want one
<br />
of MY Power Rings? Whaddya need THAT for?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision rolled his eyes and pulled his hands out of the now-drained
<br />
SWATBots.  &quot;We're gonna exploit the incompatibility between the two power
<br />
sources, by... DUCK!!&quot;  Sonic and Sally instinctively did so as a laser bolt
<br />
whizzed over their heads from another SWATBot, which Vision then fried with
<br />
a blast of electricity.  &quot;Look, there's a game I played as a small kid where
<br />
you get a toy if you flip a metal ring onto a large spike.  We're gonna play
<br />
that tonight, but our prize this time is a very loud BOOM. Got it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked, then smirked as the goal of the tactic dawned on him.
<br />
&quot;Heh. Oookay, I hope this works, Vis...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision found a small door on one of the boxes and opened it, looking
<br />
inside.. &quot;You and me both... Empty, good. Sally, hide in here, then be
<br />
prepared to jet out of here with Sonic when things start going haywire.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded, and climbed in, having Nicole provide light in the empty
<br />
box.  Vision then turned to Sonic.  &quot;On three, Blue Boy.  One... Two...
<br />
THREE!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sped out from behind the large boxes, and spotted three SWATBots
<br />
approaching.  He put his thumbs on his ears and razzed them, then sped off
<br />
as they gave chase, firing at him.  Vision waited for them to pass, and said
<br />
&quot;Wish me luck, Sally!&quot; He began to stealthily make his way to the platform,
<br />
zapping two SWATBots headed in Bunnie's direction along the way.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally kept the door to the box closed, saying, &quot;Good luck.. we'll all
<br />
need it..&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik surveyed the room impatiently.  &quot;Why haven't the SWATBots
<br />
drawn those rodents out of their little hiding spaces yet? I... What's
<br />
this?&quot;  He spotted Sonic zipping around the large room, dodging shots from
<br />
the five SWATBots pursuing him, as well as a couple of bolts from the Ry'den
<br />
star.  &quot;WHAT is that miserable hedgehog up to? He can't possibly believe
<br />
that...&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord Robotnik!&quot; Packbell exclaimed, turning to fire his laser rifle at
<br />
something.  He never got a shot off, however, as a bolt of electricity
<br />
slammed into him, sending him flying off the platform.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik quickly spun around towards the source of the bolt, and found
<br />
Vision standing on the platform, his hands behind his back.  &quot;Greetings, oh
<br />
fat one!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik glared at Vision startledly. &quot;Who...? WHAT...??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision smirked. &quot;WHO is one of those to whom that crystal really
<br />
belongs to, and WHAT _you're_ gonna do is give it back, if ya know what's
<br />
good for ya.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik scowled at Vision's impunity, his eyes glowing a bright red. 
<br />
&quot;Sooo... _you're_ the ones who it belonged to... hmm...&quot;  He reached over to
<br />
a rifle laying next to a control panel.  &quot;Well, I'm afraid that I've grown
<br />
attached to this wonderful bauble, so...&quot; he said, pointing the rifle at
<br />
Vision, &quot;You can't have it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision just sighed and threw up his arms... &quot;Oh well, in that case...&quot;
<br />
He then grinned. &quot;...neither can you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Now, Blue Boy!*
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sped past the platform, seven SWATBots now in pursuit.  He
<br />
reached into his backpack, pulled out a Power Ring, and quickly tossed it to
<br />
Vision.  &quot;Catch!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision caught the Power Ring, and deftly flipped it towards the Ry'den
<br />
Star.  It sailed over Robotnik's head in an arc, and landed on the topmost
<br />
spike of the star with a 'clink'.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Let's move, guys, Two minutes 'till this place goes up!*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik watched the ring sail over and land, then turned to see Vision
<br />
wave, &quot;C'ya, wouldn't wanna be ya!&quot; and jump off the platform.  he stood,
<br />
confused at this tactic, until a screeching sound coming from the Ry'den
<br />
Star enlightened him.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dr. Robotnik, sir!&quot; Snively shouted, panicked. &quot;The Power Ring is
<br />
creating a major energy feedback! Systems are overloading!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO!&quot; He turned to see the Ry'den Star glowing brightly, energy arcing
<br />
out in every direction, making electronics go haywire around it.  He spotted
<br />
two SWATBots nearby. &quot;SWATBOTS! Remove that blasted Power Ring from there at
<br />
ONCE!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SWATBots, fearing Robotnik's wrath more than the Ry'den Star,
<br />
immediately began to advance towards it.  They only managed to get 6' close
<br />
to it before it's energies lashed out at them, reducing them to smoking
<br />
rubble.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dr. Robotnik!!&quot;  Snively exclaimed, very panicked now.  &quot;The crystal's
<br />
energy level is reaching critical, and will result in a massive explosion in
<br />
two minutes! We must evacuate, Sir!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This news sent Robotnik into a total conniption. &quot;NoNoNONOOOOO! THIS
<br />
CAN'T BE HAPPENING!!!!!!&quot;  He smashed a monitor to pieces with his robotic
<br />
arm, then glared at Packbell, who was pulling himself back up on the
<br />
platform, not looking to be in good shape, and having some choice words to
<br />
say.  Robotnik's eyes glowed even brighter as he said, &quot;Commander Packbell,
<br />
make sure those miserable Freedom Fighters and their friend never leave this
<br />
place!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell stood and nodded. &quot;Yes, Lord Robotnik.&quot; He leapt off the
<br />
platform as Robotnik and Snively left for the shuttle, muttering, &quot;I knew
<br />
something like this would happen, you sputtering fat fool...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie, Antoine, and Tails all caught Vision's thoughtsend, and blinked
<br />
in confusion at each other... Then the building began to shake a bit...
<br />
Bunnie exclaimed, &quot;Darlin's, ah think it's time to get outta here!!&quot;  She
<br />
grabbed Tails and Antoine and began running for the nearest open door.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made it to the door and turned the corner, only to find three
<br />
SWATBots blocking their path. &quot;FREEZE!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the Freedom Fighters could react, however, three bright yellow
<br />
plasma bolts sailed over them, one after the other, towards the SWATBots,
<br />
obliterating them. They spun around to see Vision holding a large looking
<br />
blaster weapon. He walked over to Bunnie and handed it to her. &quot;That toy I
<br />
found in that room earlier. Happy Holidays.&quot; He said with a grin.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie OOFed a bit as she was handed the heavy weapon. &quot;But...&quot; Vision
<br />
held up his hand and looked behind him. &quot;Gotta take care of Sally and blue
<br />
Boy. We'll meet ya at the rendezvous point. Bye!&quot; He waved and zipped back
<br />
into the room.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie blinked, then turned to face the other two. &quot;Ok, boys, you heard
<br />
'im.  Let's move it!&quot;  She struggled with the weapon a bit.. &quot;This thangs
<br />
sure goshdarn heavy...  How in blazes did he...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine screamed as he pointed behind her and Tails. &quot;BUNNIE!!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie whirled around just in time to see a SWATBot bearing a similar
<br />
weapon on her.  She almost instinctively pulled the trigger, and it fired
<br />
another yellow plasma bolt into the SWATBot, blowing it to pieces.  She
<br />
stumbled a bit from the recoil.  &quot;Whew! Thanks, Antoine!&quot; She then hefted
<br />
the big gun. &quot;This thang may be heave, but it sure 'n blazes packs a
<br />
whallop! Let's go, boys! Yahoo!!&quot; and they continued on their way out of the
<br />
building.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, Sally caught Vision's thoughtsend, and then noticed the
<br />
building begin to shake.. &quot;He did it! Thank goodness... We need to get out
<br />
of here.. Nicole, on my mark, count off two minutes. Mark.&quot; and then left
<br />
the box as Nicole counted. &quot;Two minutes...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stepped out of the box, noticing a few catwalks beginning to
<br />
buckle.. it was just then that Sonic zipped up to her. &quot;All aboard on the
<br />
Sonic express!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gasped, then hopped in Sonic's arms. &quot;Where's Vision?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked around. &quot;I dunno, but he's probably doing the same thing
<br />
we are, and that's jammin' outta here!&quot;  With that, he jetted towards the
<br />
door out of the room.  A very unwelcome obstacle made Sonic stop in his
<br />
tracks, however, and that obstacle's name was Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pointed his laser rifle at the two and smiled malevolently. 
<br />
&quot;Hello, rodents!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Goodbye, sucker!&quot; A voice came from behind him.  He spun around just
<br />
in time to see a brown-furred shape slam into his chest, sending him flying
<br />
into the machine Bunnie was hiding behind before, just as it was
<br />
overloading.  Packbell twitched uncontrollably, his head slammed through the
<br />
machine's control panel, then lay still, smoking and sparking.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision landed next to Sonic and Sally, and oos, grinning.. &quot;That's
<br />
gotta hurt...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic gaped. &quot;Whoa! Way past cool, Vis!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole beeped. &quot;One minute, 45 seconds...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's our cue to blow this pop stand...&quot; said Vision, and the three
<br />
made a hasty exit out of the room and down the halls.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They sped through the hallways and corridors at breakneck speed, until
<br />
coming upon the front entrance. They opened the large door, and ran outside,
<br />
only to be stopped again by a group of ten SWATBots waiting for them.
<br />
&quot;FREEZE, INTRUDERS!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole beeped. &quot;One minute, 15 seconds...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision looked at the SWATBots as they advanced on the trio, then
<br />
grinned at Sonic. &quot;How good are you at bowling, Blue Boy?&quot;  He winked.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked and put Sally down, reaching into his backpack. &quot;I'm Way
<br />
past Cool...&quot; he said, pulling out the second Power Ring, holding it up.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The power ring glowed brightly, then bathed Sonic in a tremendous
<br />
amount of it's energy.  Sonic used this extra boost of power to roll up into
<br />
a ball and buzzsaw roll at the SWATBots, the ground set on fire behind him
<br />
as he managed to plow throw and smash eight of them, leaving two of the
<br />
outermost bots behind.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision sighed.. &quot;Seven-Ten split, Blue Boy...&quot; and discharged more of
<br />
his stored electricity at the remaining two, putting them out of commission.
<br />
He then shifted again into a form that made Sally gasp a bit...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision looked humanoid, with yellow skin that seemed to glow, a head of
<br />
black hair tied into a ponytail.  A somewhat muzzled mouth, hazel
<br />
colored eyes that looked like clear glass orbs, and fox like ears. Wings
<br />
that looked like a cross between a butterfly's and a faerie's, and a
<br />
slender tail with a slightly spaded tip.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision chuckled at Sally's response. &quot;What we really look like. C'mon,
<br />
let's fly outta here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole beeped. &quot;One minute, 0 seconds...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blinked, Nicole's voice jarring her out of her amazement. &quot;Yes,
<br />
this building's going to blow any minute.&quot; She hopped into Vision's arms and
<br />
they took off.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The entire group arrived at the rendezvous point where Dulcy was
<br />
waiting.  Vision's entrance made quite a stir, and he explained how his
<br />
current form was the one he was born with as Nicole counted downward. When
<br />
she reached ten second, Bunnie looked at the building in the distance. 
<br />
&quot;That thang's gonna blow any second, guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone watched as Nicole counted down. She reached three when there
<br />
was a bright flash coming from the building, and the entire structure blew
<br />
apart in a massive explosion, large enough to make the wind stir where they
<br />
were standing. 
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine eep!d and shuddered.. &quot;I ahm very fortune hunting that we have
<br />
gotten our books out of there...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic rolled his eyes. &quot;Ant, your wording stinks, as usual. Still, we
<br />
think we get the picture.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine hmmphed indignantly at Sonic, and Sally stepped in between the
<br />
two.  &quot;I think this is a good time to get back to Knothole, everyone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else nodded in agreement, and started on their journey back.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sat in his chair at the Command Center, seething as he
<br />
observed the exploding building on the main viewscreen.  Snively was
<br />
cowering at a smaller monitor, knowing better than to get in Robotnik's way
<br />
in moments like this... &quot;Snively?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively gulped audibly as Robotnik called him.  He faced Robotnik,
<br />
wishing he had some hole to jump into. &quot;Y-y-y-y-yessss, S-s-s-sirr?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik didn't move an inch, nor did his expression change. &quot;I want
<br />
you to listen to me _very_ carefully... What I have to say is crucial, both
<br />
to my mental well being... and your _physical_ well being...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively gulped again, jumping a bit at the thinly veiled threat.
<br />
Robotnik continued, &quot;That... alien, helping those accursed rodents...
<br />
Whatever it takes... I want to know everything there is to know about him
<br />
and his kind.... Do you hear me, Snively?&quot; He turned towards Snively, his
<br />
face taking on a terrifying scowl, his eyes glowing infernally.
<br />
&quot;EVERYTHING...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively yelped and hid behind a chair, breathing rapidly... &quot;*gulp!*
<br />
Y-y-y-y-y-yesssSss S-s-s-s-sir... Will w-w-ork on it imm-m-m-ediatly,
<br />
S-s-s-s-sir...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See that you do.&quot; Robotnik turned back towards the viewscreen, seeing
<br />
the rubble of the building.  The time has come, he thought, to devise
<br />
something that will rid me of those Freedom Fighters.. and that wretched
<br />
blue hedgehog... forever....
<br />
