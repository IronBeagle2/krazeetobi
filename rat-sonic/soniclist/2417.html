The KNUCKLES stories have been something of a departure from how we handle
<br />
SONIC. For one thing, SEGA has been VERY receptive to the back story we're
<br />
creating for him. As you will see, it's somewhat more dark and serious than
<br />
anything you've yet seen in the SONIC stories. FATHERS &amp; SONS, if anything,
<br />
is more in the tone of the upcoming mini-series than anything that has come
<br />
before. The key difference is that the mini-series has a LOT more action. The
<br />
interesting aspect is how the stories developed. Initially, I came up with
<br />
the concept of KNUCKLES undergoing some sort of training period/ascension
<br />
rite to show how he became Guardian of the Floating Island. Archimedes was
<br />
created to play a specific role in that development. As initially presented,
<br />
KNUCKLES was TOO much of a loner, and he needed someone to play off of. When
<br />
the mini-series was proposed later, more was called for and we had to rethink
<br />
a number of items in order to really make this special. For instance, we were
<br />
told to lay the groundwork in a back-up sequence for three issues leading
<br />
into the mini-series, much like we had done previously for PRINCESS SALLY.
<br />
After we had completed those 3 eight page segments and the 1st issue of
<br />
KNUCKLES, we had received word Scott wanted another KNUCKLES story for the SS
<br />
VS HK SPECIAL #1. This, in turn, led to the development of FATHERS &amp; SONS,
<br />
essentially a last minute decision on my part and Mike's to feature a crucial
<br />
development that will be an important part to KNUCKLES during the mini-series
<br />
and beyond. You, the reader, will be required to fill in some blanks until we
<br />
fill them in for you. (This is called a set-up. If sales are comparable to
<br />
SONIC'S, a KNUCKLES series shouldn't be long in coming. And, boy, is there a
<br />
lot of stories to tell you.)
<br />

<br />
One thing for those who try to keep track of continuity in the SONIC
<br />
UNIVERSE. We have tried to consider what was being done in other books and
<br />
especially in the cartoons. However, we never had access to everything that
<br />
was going on regarding the animated series unless the people at SEGA informed
<br />
us. However, because of dealines and the approval process, it just wasn't
<br />
possible to be as consistent as we'd like. Consequently, when the cartoon
<br />
went off the air, it freed the status quo up a lot in order of what we could
<br />
and couldn't do. Also, SEGA seems to have a better grasp of what they do and
<br />
don't want to do with the characters. For example, originally, KNUCKLES was
<br />
the only echidna and the last of his kind. And now........but that would be
<br />
telling, and you'll just have to wait and see.
