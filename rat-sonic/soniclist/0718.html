To all those who have commented on Bloodlines:
<br />

<br />
Thanks for your support.  A few things to get off the top of my desk:
<br />

<br />
[Note: if you haven't read the story yet, we're talking major spoilers
<br />
coming up here]
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all honesty, I had no idea that Bunnie and Sandy's relationship
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would take the turn it did when I started writing.  I had no
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intention of outing Bunnie or anyone else.  But at one point when I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was struggling with the final scene, in which Sonic and Sally were
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be featured as well, the image of Bunnie and Sandy kissing
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;popped into my head and wouldn't let go.  *I* was shocked at first,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but then in looking back at the story I could sort of determine how
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other incidents (the initial meeting in Ch. 1, the dialogue in Ch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6, the combat against the SWATbots in Ch. 10) could have been said
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be leading up to that moment.  Obviously I wrote this before
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reading &quot;The Power of Love,&quot; and before Netscape was installed on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my machine so I could discover how large a part Bunnie plays in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mature [or should that be &quot;IMmature&quot;?] Fan Art section of Rotor's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;homepage.  I was sort of afraid that some of her drooling fanboys
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;would take umbrage.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope nobody got too bummed by my allowing Queen Alicia to die.  I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;suppose that I was inspired by the death of Julayla in Sonic #18
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;In The Still Of The Night&quot;).  It certainly gave me a chance to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(re)construct Mobian burial customs.  While I was writing this, I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was rehearsing Faure's &quot;Requiem&quot; for a performance (I was in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chorus) so I guess the subject was on my mind.  I also viewed the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burial of Queen Alicia in Chapter 8 almost as the flip side of the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Circle of Life&quot; sequence from _The Lion King_.  I even went so far
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as to try to come up with an appropriate stanza to be sprinkled
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;throughout the passage, passing it off as a &quot;half-remembered cradle
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;song&quot; that was part of the Mobian collective consciousness.  It's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just as well; I don't know that I could have pulled it off without
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being too heavyhanded.  Besides, I was only able to write the back
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;half of the stanza:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when the dust has received us
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the sons of our daughters are gone
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hearts and the minds/Of those left behind
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The love and the memories live on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the circle of life....
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm beginning to think that, as Shawn seems to be specializing in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introducing bits and pieces of &quot;Treknology&quot; into the Sonic corpus, I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;seem to prefer delving into the social history of Mobius: its
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;history and customs.  One short story I'm working on touches briefly
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on what can only be called a religious cult, and another longer
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;story that's started to come together (and which will represent the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;final battle for the fate of Mobius) is shot through with mythology
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- but first I need to research the Chaos Emeralds, their origin and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;properties.  Based on Brad's description of their role in the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;original Sonic comic miniseries, there's some good potential
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;material there.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also began the story back in December/January, so I wasn't up on
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the impending Sally miniseries with its &quot;evil twin&quot; plot twist.  It
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wasn't much of a surprise -- dummy covers for issue #3 in just about
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any ad showed her doing battle with herself, so the only question
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was: what was the source of the evil twin?  It's a subject close to
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my heart in that I'm a twin myself.  In the case of Sandy, I hoped
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to create a character that would seen to be related to Sally yet
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinct.  Not &quot;evil&quot; by any means but definitely different.  And
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of the comments I still hear whenever I have visited my brother
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the odd holiday is how much we sound alike!  So Bunnie's
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mistaking Sandy for Sally on the basis of voice is plausible as far
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as I'm concerned.
<br />

<br />
Thanks for putting up with my ramblings.  I believe that the entire
<br />
story will show up on Rotor's home page at some point.  If you missed a
<br />
chapter or two, let me know and I can email it out to you -- I haven't
<br />
got around to deleting it from my hard drive yet.
<br />

<br />
We now return you to your regularly scheduled rodent.
