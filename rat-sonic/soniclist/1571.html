<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked, then eyed Vision's amulet. &quot;Heyyy, you're right! I 
<br />
_knew_ I'd seen that somewhere...&quot; He glared at Vision, furrowing his
<br />
eyebrow. &quot;So, what gives??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Headless gopher, eh?&quot; Vision chuckled.  &quot;That must've been Darius.
<br />
He likes to use that illusion to scare people away from our subbase there.&quot;
<br />
He knealt down and smiled at Tails.  &quot;You can relax, Tails, I'm no ghost.
<br />
This amulet just carries the symbol of my homeworld, Keld'yr.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails peeked out from behind Sonic, looking more confused than
<br />
frightened now. &quot;K-keld'yr? Homeworld?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic hrm'd, then patted Tails' head. &quot;Tell ya later, big guy.  We've
<br />
got business to take care of, and it's got Robuttnik written all over it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, they made their way to the hub, formulating a plan and
<br />
deciding who to send on the mission.  Sally, Sonic, and Vision were most
<br />
certainly going.  Bunnie, because they could use her strength.  Dulcy for an
<br />
airborne escape. Sally was loathe to include Tails in the mission because of
<br />
his youth, but Sonic and Vision convinced her that his natural tracking
<br />
skills would be very helpful.  And finally, Antoine, that decision coming
<br />
after much protest from Sonic.  Sally felt that he was good for something,
<br />
and Vision noted that one more Freedom Fighter wouldn't hurt.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each of the Freedom Fighters were approached by Sally and Sonic, and
<br />
told to accompany them to the war room to be briefed on the mission.  The
<br />
entire group met at the door, which Sally opened for them.  They all
<br />
entered to see Sonic waiting for them. &quot;Hey, guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey there, Sugarhog!&quot; Bunnie replied, then paused, looking back to
<br />
see the &quot;Sonic&quot; that came with the group walk in and up to the head of the
<br />
long table. &quot;Huh?? What in blazes...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else was just as confused by this oddity. &quot;Oh, mon dieu!&quot;
<br />
Antoine said with obvious dismay. &quot;There ahre being TWO Soneecs?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I wouldn't say that...&quot; The &quot;Sonic&quot; at the table replied. He then
<br />
glowed brightly and morphed into a tan-furred ferret with a ponytail and a
<br />
gold amulet around his neck.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, of course, had produced a variety of gasps and astonished
<br />
responses from most of the people in the room. &quot;Whoa!&quot; &quot;Sacre' Bleu!!&quot;
<br />
&quot;What th'&quot; &quot;Oh mah stars...&quot; &quot;Oh my..&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic chuckled, having been privy to this planned display.  Even
<br />
though he still didn't trust this alien, he could always appreciate a good
<br />
prank.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rolled her eyes, chuckling at these antics. She walked up to
<br />
Vision and introduced him.  &quot;Freedom Fighters, this is Vision. I'll let him
<br />
speak, because what he has to say is _very_ important to this mission.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, M'lady, &quot;Vision said as Sally took her place at the table.
<br />
&quot;If y'all will take a seat, I'll begin by explaining who, and _what_ I
<br />
am...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, at Robotropolis, Dr. Ivo Robotnik was sitting in his chair 
<br />
at Central Command, deep in thought and looking very unamused.  &quot;Snively...&quot;
<br />
he said, &quot;My day isn't looking very bright right now... How is it that I
<br />
can find such a wonderful energy storage crystal, yet not be able to use
<br />
one _BIT_ of the energy stored within it???&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively turned away from his instrument panel and said, nervously,
<br />
&quot;W-we've been having trouble with the power extraction equipment, S-sir...
<br />
There seems to be a tremendous amount of phase...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, then...&quot; Robotnik interrupted, &quot;Perhaps we should _fix_ the
<br />
trouble...&quot; his eyes glowed a brighter red. &quot;...and _SOON_. Am I clear on
<br />
this, Snively??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively gulped visibly. &quot;Y-y-yes, S-sir... working on a routine I
<br />
created right now, Sir..&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good...&quot; Robotnik replied, and went back to his brooding, something
<br />
he seemed to do exceedingly well...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord Robotnik...&quot; A familiar voice spoke, interrupting his
<br />
brooding.  Robotnik spun his chair around to see Commander Packbell
<br />
standing before him, flanked by two SWATBots.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, my beloved Packbell...&quot; Robotnik said with a smile.  &quot;I take it
<br />
that that group of rebels in your care have been processed?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir, they've been roboticized. Sir...&quot; Packbell replied, &quot;I feel
<br />
it necessary for us to double security at the laboratory where our latest..
<br />
acquisition is located.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmm...&quot; Robotnik mused. &quot;Our current resources are somewhat short in
<br />
that department, thanks to that annoying blue rodent and his friends... Are
<br />
you sure this is necessary?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir...&quot; said Packbell. &quot;The potential that this crystal has
<br />
would most certainly attract unwanted attention.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Perhaps...&quot; Robotnik replied, &quot;Though I doubt those miserable rodents
<br />
will discover it until it's too late... Still, I admire your enthusiasm.
<br />
Permission granted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, sir. That is all,&quot; Packbell said, and turned around,
<br />
leaving the room. &quot;...You pathetic, bloated fool...&quot; he thought to himself,
<br />
&quot;You've no idea what you're dealing with...&quot;  He doubted that the base they
<br />
found the crystal in wasn't abandoned recently.  He also knew that the
<br />
crystal didn't originate from this world. He couldn't shake the feeling
<br />
that its original owners would soon come calling, somehow...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik resumed his brooding, only to be interrupted again. &quot;Dr.
<br />
Robotnik, sir! The latest results of our tests on the crystal have arrived!
<br />
They look quite promising, Sir!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik raised an eyebrow. &quot;On viewscreen, Snively...&quot; He read the
<br />
data that began to creep up the large screen in front of him, and an evil
<br />
smile crept up on his face. &quot;Very promising indeed... Yes, perhaps I _am_
<br />
having a good day, after all...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision recounted what he told Sonic and Sally with the rest of the
<br />
assembled group of Freedom Fighters, then helped them form an attack plan;
<br />
The goal being to retrieve the Ry'den Star if possible, to destroy it
<br />
otherwise.  Vision would be the one to destroy it, knowing the safest method
<br />
of rendering it unusable.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After forming a solid plan, everyone waited until dark, then went
<br />
outside to take off for Robotropolis.  Dulcy looked at the group.  &quot;I'm not
<br />
sure I can carry this many...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic smirked and put on his backpack.  &quot;I can juice over there with
<br />
Tails.&quot;  Tails gleefully hopped into the backpack in response.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision nodded and said, &quot;And as for me...&quot;  He glowed and changed into
<br />
a brown-furred bat.  &quot;I can provide my own transportation,&quot; he said with a
<br />
grin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally blinked at Vision's transformation, noting that she wasn't going
<br />
to get used to that for quite a while.  &quot;Well, that's settled.  Let's move.&quot;
<br />
With that, the group left for Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the way, Tails was talking to Sonic.  &quot;Aw, c'mon, Sonic, Vision's
<br />
kinda neat! A little weird, but neat.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I dunno, little bro',&quot; Sonic mused, &quot;I'm still not sure I trust him;
<br />
this could be some sorta trap... I mean, Robuttnik's had aliens helping him
<br />
before, and he...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, he has, has he?&quot; Vision interrupted, flying in closer to the two. 
<br />
&quot;Hmm... I've had my suspicions... This bears looking into.  Tell me, you
<br />
ever see any of these aliens?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked startledly, then nodded.  &quot;Yup.  It was on that Spy
<br />
Satellite that me n' Rotor took down.  It was uuuug-LY!  Looked like a big
<br />
brown furred ball, with yellow eyes, and these slimy lookin' tenticle-like
<br />
things coming out of it... It tried to wrap them around me, yuck!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision listened, musing, then made a face.  &quot;Bleah... Sounds like a
<br />
Tenadian Alley Dweller.. Nasty suckers, they like to feed off the blood of
<br />
sapients.  They usually take _days_ to feed off someone.  It prolly thought
<br />
you looked pretty tasty, Blue Boy.&quot;  He grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic blinked at that, then shuddered, nearly tripping as he ran. 
<br />
&quot;EEEEEEEEEEW!!  YUCK!!!  That thing TOUCHED me?!?! Ewwewweww!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision chuckled, and Sally shouted down, &quot;Keep quiet down there, we're
<br />
getting close...&quot;  The border of Robotropolis was in view as they made their
<br />
way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of Robotropolis' buildings didn't look any more cheerful
<br />
that the outsides did.  Drab hallways, cold grey walls, and dark rooms were
<br />
the rule, and this particular building on the outskirts of Robotropolis was
<br />
no exception.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one of the air vents, however, the color scheme was changed
<br />
slightly, as a bright orange glow began to form a large circle on one of
<br />
it's walls.  The circle completed itself, then a grey metallic arm punched
<br />
out the metal within the circle.  The metal was cooled by some device, and
<br />
the head of a tiger popped through the newly formed hole and said in a raspy
<br />
voice, &quot;Heeeeeeeere's JOHNNY!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of Vision's body climbed through the hole, followed by Sonic,
<br />
who's eyebrow was quirked as he said, &quot;Weird, man, weird...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the group filed through the hole, and Sally pulled out
<br />
Nicole. &quot;Nicole, are there any records of this building in your database?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Working, Sally...&quot; Nicole replied in her ever calm voice.  &quot;No mention
<br />
of this building exist in early Mobotropolian records.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally frowned.  &quot;He must've recently built it.  We're going to have to
<br />
play it by ear...&quot;  She looked at Vision. &quot;Where to now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, perhaps we should let Tails discern that.&quot;  He handed Tails the
<br />
datapad he had been using to track the Ry'den Star's energy pattern.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails looked at the datapad confusedly... &quot;I can't read all these
<br />
weird looking letters...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision chuckled.  &quot;You don't need to, just follow that big arrow on
<br />
there and your instincts and you'll do just fine. When that arrow starts
<br />
turning red, you'll know we're getting close.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails nodded and smiled. &quot;Ok. I can understand that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision pulled out another datapad, seemingly out of nowhere.  &quot;And I'll
<br />
be looking out for bots in the meantime.  Shall we?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded.  &quot;Lets. We haven't a moment to lose.&quot;  And the group made
<br />
their way through the vents, Tails leading the way.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made their way through the vents to a dim hallway.  Assured that
<br />
there were no SWATBots present, they made their way through.  They passed a
<br />
doorway, when Vision stopped them. &quot;Guys, hold up a bit...&quot;  He zipped into
<br />
the room stealthily as the others looked at each other in confusion.  After
<br />
a brief moment, he came back out.  &quot;A little toy I found. I'll explain
<br />
later.&quot;  Everyone shrugged and continued.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They made a turn, following Tails, when Vision stopped them again. &quot;Bots
<br />
coming at 3 and 9 o'clock, guys. Move towards the wall and stay put.&quot;
<br />
Everyone moved towards the nearest wall, then Vision began to change shape,
<br />
forming a metallic-like box around them. Antoine almost screamed at this, but
<br />
Sonic quickly slapped his hand over his mouth and whispered,  &quot;Cool your
<br />
jets, Ant, or we're all toast!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through a small hole Vision left, Sally could see two SWATBot patrols
<br />
walk by from both directions, apparently mistaking Vision for some machine
<br />
located in the hall.  After a moment, Vision reformed back into a tiger. 
<br />
&quot;Coast is clear, let's move.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They continued on, with Antoine shakily saying &quot;I would very much be
<br />
liking a warning before yeu try and serrigate us like that again...&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rolled her eyes.  &quot;That's 'suffocate', Antoine, and he was
<br />
disguising us from the SWATBots...&quot;  Antoine complained a bit more as they
<br />
continued, not noticing a shielded camera observing them from a hole in one
<br />
of the walls...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik was in the same building, in a large room, working on some
<br />
form of device.  Snively was there reading off data from a terminal, trying
<br />
to ignore various taunts from Packbell, who was overseeing security.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik rose from his device, removing his goggles.  &quot;There, that
<br />
should do it... Now, if only I had a suitable subject to test this...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was interrupted by a SWATBot.  &quot;PRIORITY ONE HEDGEHOG ALERT! FREEDOM
<br />
FIGHTERS LOCATED IN HALLWAY 13F! PRIORITY ONE HEDGEHOG ALERT!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell observed the monitors... &quot;Six of them located, Lord Robotnik.
<br />
One of them being the Hedgehog.  It appears they're heading towards this
<br />
room...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really? I was wondering if we'd see those annoying rodents traipsing
<br />
through here... Hmmm...&quot;  An evil smile crept up on Robotnik's face.  &quot;Let
<br />
them come, though not TOO easily... I have something to show them.&quot;  He
<br />
laughed as he made his way to a control panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell nodded, and ordered the SWATBots to comply.  He then looked at
<br />
the monitors again, and raised an eyebrow.. &quot;Those datapads the fox and the
<br />
tiger carry... The fox I've seen before, but the other one... Hrm...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* * *
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters continued on, dodging a few more SWATBot patrols. 
<br />
They entered another air duct, and soon came across a large room.  Tails
<br />
looked at the datapad he carried.. &quot;I think it's in here, guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vision nodded and checked his datapad... &quot;Just four bots outside the
<br />
door to this room... Think we should make our way in?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked out the vent, then nodded.  They opened the vent and made
<br />
their way into the room.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room was incredibly dark, with only a few small blinking lights
<br />
providing any light.  Everyone made their way around with some difficulty,
<br />
and Sonic looked around, saying.. &quot;Man... Someone should get the lights in
<br />
here...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Allow me, rodent...&quot; A familiar and malevolent voice said... The room
<br />
brightened, and a few metal boxes could be seen in the large room, as well
<br />
as a good amount of scaffolding.  There was a large, humming device in the
<br />
center of the room, with a glowing, bright yellow, multi-faceted starlike
<br />
crystal being suspended in the middle of it by some form of tractor beam. 
<br />
And, standing on a platform located in front of the device was Packbell,
<br />
Snively, and the large round shape of Dr. Robotnik.  &quot;Greetings, hedgehog...
<br />
So glad you could drop in...&quot; he said with an evil grin.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole group stood in their tracks, a few gasps coming from it. 
<br />
Sally looked at the device, and the crystal in the middle of it, and
<br />
silently mouthed the words &quot;Is that it?&quot; to Vision, who nodded in reply.
<br />
He had a bad feeling about things...
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic jumped forward and pointed at Robotnik.  &quot;You've got something
<br />
that doesn't belong to you, Robuttnik, and we're here to take it away!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, are you, now?&quot; Robotnik replied with a sneer.  &quot;And I suppose I
<br />
should just hand it over to you? No, I don't think that's going to happen at
<br />
all, rodent.  I'd much rather destroy you with it instead.&quot;  He grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HA!&quot; Sonic shouted. &quot;Yeah, right!  You can't even figure out how to
<br />
use that thing!&quot;  He advanced a step forward.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik smiled even more. &quot;Oh, on the contrary... I already have.
<br />
Snively?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively grinned evilly, and replied, &quot;Yes, Dr. Robotnik, Sir!&quot;  he
<br />
pushed a button on the machine's control panel.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Ry'den star glowed even brighter, and energy started arcing along
<br />
it's surface.  Suddenly, it discharged a large bolt of energy directly at
<br />
Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHOOOOA!&quot; Sonic yelped as he zipped backwards just in time. The bolt
<br />
slammed into the ground with explosive force, leaving a huge hole in the
<br />
floor.  The Freedom Fighters gasped at this near miss.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively grinned, and targetted the entire group, pressing the firing
<br />
button again. Robotnik laughed evilly as the Ry'den Star charged up again...
