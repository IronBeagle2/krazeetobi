<br />
for inclusion in FAQ File, usual SPOILER warnings apply:
<br />

<br />
#34  [May 1996]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spaziante cover.  Scott lets it be known, merely in passing,
<br />
that Spaziante has been the regular cover artist since #31.  Like
<br />
we couldn't have figured that out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To Bot Or Not To Bot&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo DeCesare; Art: Brian Thomas (debut)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story starts out with a jolt, as Uncle Chuck and Muttski
<br />
endure yet another failed attempt at being deroboticized. 
<br />
Meanwhile, the scene shifts to Robotropolis in a panel which (in
<br />
an echo of the opening credits of StH) reminds us that the city
<br />
is on the shore of a lake or bay.  Seems to me this is a useful
<br />
plot point, but anyway.  Robotnik has watched &quot;Patton&quot; once too
<br />
often and has assembled a troop of Combots, camouflaged soldier
<br />
bots with which he plans to attack the Great Forest.  Robotnik
<br />
loses the element of surprise, however, because Dulcy has
<br />
overheard his plans.  She doesn't repeat the message exactly
<br />
right but Sally gets the picture.  Sonic, Uncle Chuck and Muttski
<br />
return to Robotropolis to take out the Combots.  Once inside the
<br />
compound, however, Robotnik zaps Uncle Chuck and Muttski to bring
<br />
their minds back under his control.  Uncle Chuck arrests Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Tails, Bunnie and Antoine return from
<br />
patrol to report no sign of Sonic.  The three of them are wearing
<br />
the same black turtleneck sweater and knit stocking cap
<br />
combination they last wore in &quot;That's The Spirit!&quot; [Sonic #20] --
<br />
just the thing for late night commando operations or a casual
<br />
evening of stalking your ex-wife [Freedom Fighter outfits
<br />
provided by O.J.'s of Brentwood].  Sonic shows up soon enough --
<br />
lashed to the front of a tank Robotnik is driving at the head of
<br />
his Combots.  Very sadistic touch -- I LOVE IT!  Sally calls
<br />
retreat and has the freedom fighters abandon Knothole for an
<br />
underground shelter.  Unfortunately, Robotnik cuts them off. 
<br />
However, when Robotnik gives the Combots the order to flatten the
<br />
Great Forest, they malfunction by turning around and marching off
<br />
the nearest cliff.  At the same time Sonic has managed to escape
<br />
his bonds and has commandeered Robotnik's tank. Robotnik and
<br />
Snively beat a retreat in a hover craft driven by Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wha' hoppened?  Thanks to Rotor's exposition, we learn that
<br />
Rotor had fitted both Uncle Chuck and Muttski with neuro-
<br />
overriders -- the same electronic gizmos that DIDN'T work for
<br />
Sally in &quot;Steel Belted Sally&quot; [the infamous Sonic #29].  Amazing
<br />
what a drop of solder in the right place can do.  So while
<br />
pretending to be back under Robotnik's influence, Uncle Chuck was
<br />
able to reprogram the Combots and make sure that Sonic could
<br />
escape easily from being lashed to the tank.  It also helps
<br />
maintain his cover and gets him back in the spy business.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brian's artwork isn't seriously off-model, and his rendering
<br />
of Dulcy is especially dead-on.  Still, his rendering of the
<br />
Mobians (especially the females) has them looking a little too
<br />
cute.  No matter; welcome aboard, B.T.!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sense of History, Part I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders; Art: Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After months of two-page vamps, Kanterovich &amp; Penders start
<br />
into the 3-parter prelude to the next Knuckles miniseries.  It
<br />
begins with a recap of echidnoid civilization:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time, the echidnas were the top of the Mobian
<br />
heap in terms of having an advanced civilization centered in
<br />
Echidnapolis, an island city surrounded by the Great River (once
<br />
again, for all their advances, they do have a knack for taking
<br />
only one adjective, &quot;Great&quot;, and running it into the ground). 
<br />
Which would have been the fate of Echidnapolis if a couple
<br />
distant relatives of Knuckles hadn't determined that a white
<br />
comet was going to wipe out the city.  To avert this disaster,
<br />
the populace fanned out to gather together a dozen chaos emeralds
<br />
and place them in subterranean caverns beneath the city.  This
<br />
caused the island city to become a floating island, just in time.
<br />
Which was all well and good, according to Knuckles our narrator,
<br />
except that this somehow ties in with the creation of Mount Fate
<br />
and the appearance of a great menace.  To be continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it worth the wait?  For me it was, but then again I'm a
<br />
sucker for a good origins story.  You get an idea of how many
<br />
hair styles an echidna is capable of, and there's a VERY nice use
<br />
of close-up at the top of page 6.  Aside from the fact that the
<br />
situation reminded me a little too much of the fate of the planet
<br />
Krypton (in a &quot;What if...&quot; sort of way), Kanterovich &amp; Penders
<br />
have pulled it off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: I have a really hard time believing that kids
<br />
are writing to ask Scott Fulop to be a pen pal.  It's a little
<br />
like saying that, in the heyday of the New Yorker when they were
<br />
running cartoons by Thurber, that fan mail was coming in
<br />
addressed to Harold Ross!  Then again, recent communiques by Ken
<br />
Penders have spoken of Fulop almost as if he were the editor in
<br />
the past tense.  So perhaps the guard has changed and we haven't
<br />
been told yet.  Let's cut to the chase: Sonic #35 will attempt to
<br />
answer questions concerning Sonic and the power rings (the cover
<br />
art shows Sonic and what appear to be the masks of the Ancient
<br />
Walk-Ons...er, Walkers).  Bunnie fanboy alert: she's scheduled to
<br />
do a solo story in Sonic #37 (Rich Koslowski handling both script
<br />
and art) and will be a featured player in an upcoming two-parter
<br />
(script by Gallagher, art by Spaziante -- talk about your odd
<br />
couples!).  Espio will also be getting a solo shot.  Nathan Gropp
<br />
of Rochester, Indiana, wants to know if E.V.E. [Sonic #21] will
<br />
be coming back into the story; the response indicates that it all
<br />
depends on fan response.  OK, all you Fiona Fox fans out there,
<br />
you have your work cut out for you!
