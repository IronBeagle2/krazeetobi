&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other Sonics #1-- The Barbarian : Part Two
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Robert Haynie

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the Fourth
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Darker world, the ones called Magi suggest that there is
<br />
no such thing as coincidence, that the shattered fragments of the
<br />
beginning of all things strive to rejoin and thus pattern all
<br />
occurrences and happenings towards that end.  Maybe.  But whether
<br />
cosmic forces compel happenstance towards a great destiny, or
<br />
whether crap just happens, Milos was about to have his lifestyle
<br />
severely reorganized.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One would think that the prospect of such a thing would have
<br />
appealed to the street-thief.  But Tails knew his life, his
<br />
patterns of destiny, and was comfortable in them-- not from a
<br />
physical viewpoint, to be sure, but from an unstated spiritual one.
<br />
He knew his place in the world, as did his four charges, as did the
<br />
hedgehog and the princess and the swordbunny and the mage and the
<br />
spy, and especially the two thaumaturges.  For those who follow the
<br />
paths arcane know better than any how fragile a place is, how
<br />
mutable it can be... and Antos of Mobius and Roboth-Amon of the
<br />
Eastrealm knew instinctively that changes in places were coming.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antos' hope was to keep such changes from over-running the
<br />
kingdom and the princess he was bound to protect.  He hoped to
<br />
guide the princess, and through her the king (who was not fond of
<br />
magick) into paths that would allow the people to weather them with
<br />
the least amount of suffering and confusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roboth-amon, on the other hand, planned to ride the upcoming
<br />
changes, to mold them and all the world into a new reality-- one
<br />
where he would be like unto a god-- perhaps a god in fact,
<br />
immortal, invincible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the two-tailed fox, knowing squat about these lofty,
<br />
eldritch, and arcane matters, hoped to con a kitchen-helper out of
<br />
some spare breadcrusts.  Well, we can't all be beings of great
<br />
insight and occult knowledge.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antos crouched in his chambers, his robe tossed aside, now
<br />
clad in a simple white loincloth and a chain about his neck, with
<br />
a single, rather unimpressive blue stone in the setting.  More than
<br />
one had wondered how one as young as he could perform the mage-
<br />
feats he had, and were they to see that, they would know.  After
<br />
all, there was power in a Chaos Emerald, even those which were not
<br />
the true green.  Add to that a naturally fastidious nature (which
<br />
helps in organizing the mind), native magickal talent (without
<br />
which no magery is possible), and a peculiar streak of sheer
<br />
bloody-mindedness (which is paramount in harnessing energies that
<br />
no-one in their right mind would even consider dealing with unless
<br />
they were magi), and you had one surprisingly capable sorcerer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not an overconfident one, though.  Antos knew full well that if
<br />
it came to a open battle arcane between himself and the Dark
<br />
wizard, the result would be Dark Wizard:1, Antos:Immolation.  It
<br />
was only great distance and a natural talent for wards that had
<br />
kept the palace safe, and that could change any time.  That, and
<br />
constant vigilance...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, as he did each evening, Antos meditated, allowing his
<br />
senses to range out, attuning himself again to wards and charms he
<br />
had placed to alert him to any eldritch threat.  And, just as the
<br />
afternoon's audience had done, the gleam of power radiated from the
<br />
axe wielded by the barbarian, now ensconced in one of the guest-
<br />
chambers.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A soft foot-step from behind Antos intruded on his
<br />
meditations, and he turned his head.  The guard-captain stood
<br />
behind him, frowning.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Few would entair un sorcerer's rooms without ze invitation,
<br />
Mon Capitaine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The frown was replaced by a smile, and Bunnie sat down next to
<br />
the fox.  &quot;Ah didn't think Ah needed an invite, Antos,&quot; she
<br />
murmured, allowing herself to slip back to the dialect of her
<br />
southlands childhood.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A half-smile crossed Antos' muzzle as the rabbit drew him into
<br />
a quick, but fierce, embrace.  &quot;No, you are not needing one, mon
<br />
cher...  but still, it hardly seems proper for ze Captain of ze
<br />
Princess' Guard to be entering ze apartments of ze Sorcerair of
<br />
said Princess, nest pas'?  Zhere are always those whould suggest
<br />
plots et plans.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let'em.  Ah just wanna snuggle a bit.&quot;  Bunnie sighed, and in
<br />
a wistful tone, added, &quot;Ah just wish we could be open about us...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mais Non, Cher capitaine.  There are far to many in ze courts
<br />
zat play the game of the politics, and any sign of weakness would
<br />
call ze hunt down upon us.  And if either of us were to be
<br />
discredited, zen zat is but one more opening to ze Princess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie sighed.  &quot;Ah know.  Speaking of threats, that
<br />
hedgehog--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am sensing no evil in him, Bunnie.  He is-- how is it
<br />
said?-- too clued to be a threat.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie blinked.  &quot;Too what?&quot; she asked, drawing back in
<br />
confusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Too clued.  He is not subtle at all, he is not hiding
<br />
anything--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, y'all mean too CRUDE. Honestly, Antos, I may love that
<br />
accent of yours, but sometimes...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie rose, and left, then, to leave the sorcerer to his
<br />
work.  As she walked out, Antos mumbled, &quot;I am having an accent?
<br />
Why is everyone telling me that I am having an accent?&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Fire.  Speed, speed, and more speed, rippling though
<br />
his corpus until he thinks he will shred from the strain, and still
<br />
the fire rages.  Seven stones, golden fire...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As always, Son-Ak jerked awake just before the dream that had
<br />
haunted him since he was a child began to seem to make sense.  His
<br />
father's brother, tChak, a shaman of considerable wisdom (or so
<br />
the elders held him to be) claimed that the dreams could not--
<br />
would not be explained in the safe lands of his herding tribe.
<br />
Most people outside the northlands assumed that all the barbarian
<br />
tribes were filled with berserk warriors.  In actuality, the
<br />
berserkers were few and far between, but they did tend to be the
<br />
kind that the 'civilized' folk met.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak was no berserker, but he was a warrior of great skill
<br />
(As he would readily inform anyone who asked and most who did not)
<br />
and speed.  He was braver than most, he knew, and feared no man,
<br />
beast, or even demon-spawned sorcery (Well, he would not admit to
<br />
fearing the latter, at any rate).  Perhaps that is why the terror
<br />
that the recurring dream caused him upset him so.  It seemed
<br />
childish for a warrior of his stature and skill to wake up
<br />
sweating, shaking, barely repressing a scream of panic at the
<br />
recurring visions of gold fire-- or perhaps of rage at being
<br />
awakened just before some half-sensed revelation was to come to
<br />
pass...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as he was about to return to a fitful sleep,  a scream
<br />
DID erupt-- but not from him.  The barbarian snapped upright as a
<br />
howl of terror came forth from somewhere else in the palace.  Even
<br />
as he grabbed his battleaxe, and stepped towards the door, a
<br />
guardsman slammed it open, crying &quot;Hey, you--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I heard,&quot; replied Son-Ak.  &quot;Lead me there.&quot;
<br />
