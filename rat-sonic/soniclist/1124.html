<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;         Ok,  I couldn't help it any longer.  Your polite argument has
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; gained my attention.  Sally is a fox!!!! Her father is a fox, and her
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nephew Tails is a fox. To Chris Bajrd, yes Sally lackes the fur colour and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; markings, but so are Tails and her father. They both have the large tails,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; and the right colour, but admit it, Sally would look terrible with a huge
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tail. If you continue to call Sally anything but a fox, you're making a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; comparison not unlike calling Sonic a warthog even though Uncle Chuck is a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; hedgehog. : p
</em><br />
Ummm...as somebody pointed out a long time ago, Sally is *not* Tails' aunt.
<br />
Remember that in the cartoon series, he also called Bunnie &quot;Aunt Bunnie&quot;,
<br />
and everybody called Sir Charles &quot;Uncle Chuck.&quot;  And, as somebody else pointed
<br />
out a while back, the Archie people themselves have said that she is a
<br />
squirrel.  Now, I know that doesn't hold water with many people :), but they
<br />
are the ones who write and draw her, so their's is a strong opinion, at any
<br />
rate.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as stated in the above paragraph, there are too many odvious
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; features showing she is a fox.
</em><br />
And there's too many features that make her a squirrel as well!  The shape
<br />
of her face and head being the biggest one of all.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;           I can't beleive Antoine is a fox, it can't be possible. How could
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they insult foxes so? Of course he could be, but I think a poodle suits
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; him. Is there any one out there that likes him?
</em><br />
Ahem...ze ansahr being yez.  There's a lot to Antoine I think that we never
<br />
see since he is only used for comic relief most of the time.  But think about
<br />
it:  He has a hopeless crush on Sally, is always trying to prove himself to
<br />
her and the rest of the Freedom Fighters, and is still always coming up short
<br />
and feeling ashamed because of it.  With what I've seen in my life, I can
<br />
certainly relate to that.  As for being an insult to his species...I don't
<br />
think so.  You could say Tails is also (foxes flying??  HA! [not my true
<br />
opinion]) or even the mascot for the Fox Kids Network (that goofy little
<br />
thing?? HA! [again, not my true opinion]), but really I don't see how you
<br />
can say any person, real or ficticious, is an insult to their species,
<br />
even tho' some people do admittedly come close. :)
