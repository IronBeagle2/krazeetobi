<br />
Hello, this is MilesProw, the head operator on #sonic. I am not currently in
<br />
the greatest of moods, as I had hoped to avoid having to make an
<br />
announcement like this one. If you are a #sonic channel visitor, or ever
<br />
plan to visit in the future, then READ THIS NOTICE.
<br />

<br />
In recent nights, we have had numerous problems on #sonic. I am not speaking
<br />
of technical problems, but more of problems with some of you, the users.
<br />

<br />
I have had SEVERAL people come to the channel claiming to be me, who have
<br />
attempted to get op status. I've already dealt with several of the
<br />
perpetrators personally, and I think I have been much more than fair in this
<br />
regard. However, I'm getting sick of it. In the future, if anyone claims to
<br />
be me, you will be banned from the channel at all times while I am there. I
<br />
don't care if you were intending to take the channel over or just wanted to
<br />
say to your pals, &quot;Hey, I had op status last night!&quot; Claiming to be me(Or
<br />
any of the other ops) will be treated as a very serious offense, no matter
<br />
what you intended to do once someone else opped you. No more cutesy-poo
<br />
warnings and second chances. I suggest you don't screw up the first time
<br />
around from now on.
<br />

<br />
There have also been problems with takeover attempts, some of them
<br />
successful, on #sonic. This is due to the fact that, despite my warnings on
<br />
the Sonic IRC pages, everyone is being opped. As I said in the Web pages,
<br />
opping everybody, including people you don't even KNOW is a very bad idea,
<br />
as takeovers, bans, and general chaos are usually the result. As I said in
<br />
the Web pages, (Notice I keep saying this. Some of you obviously haven't
<br />
read them contrary to my advice to do so.) no one is to be opped except for
<br />
the channel operators, which include Mighty, Jaybird, ^Speed^, and
<br />
myself(MilesProw). If you get to the channel first and gain op status, then
<br />
wait until one of the operators arrives and op them. Do not op anyone else,
<br />
even if you know them. (More on this later.) Your op status will be revoked
<br />
once one of the operators has arrived, without any need for explanation, as
<br />
you are not entitled to it simply because you were there first. Handing over
<br />
control of the channel without question will reflect favorably upon you.
<br />

<br />
About opping people, don't ever op on Nickname alone. You MUST view
<br />
someone's User_at_Host information by doing a /whois on them, by using mIRC's
<br />
UCentral function, or by viewing the gobblediegook that appears next to a
<br />
person's name when they enter the channel. This information is very
<br />
difficult to fake (For most people), and should be used to determine if
<br />
someone is actually who they claim to be. For example, Jaybird's User_at_host
<br />
information reads: sonic2_at_cs1-02.lfd.ptd.net at least some of the time. (The
<br />
part that reads csl-02 usually changes from session to session.) But the
<br />
.lfd.ptd.net remains constant, as does the sonic2 (This is user defined and
<br />
can be changed easily. Don't rely on this alone.) Become familiar with the
<br />
operators' User_at_Host information when you use IRC and be ready to recognize it.
<br />

<br />
One other problem that I have noticed recently is that some people seem to
<br />
find it amusing to annoy other #sonic users. Naturally, having somebody piss
<br />
you off while you're trying to relax detracts from your enjoyment. So, as
<br />
blatantly obvious as this may seem to some of you, I have to tell others to
<br />
try to act like a civil individual while they're using chat. (I find it hard
<br />
to believe that you act this way when you're talking to somebody face to
<br />
face. I guess I shouldn't be surprised.) If I tell you to stop doing
<br />
something, you do it. This holds true with all of the other operators as
<br />
well. Harassing other users, especially after I tell you to stop, is another
<br />
SERIOUS offense, and you will be kick/banned. The ban will remain in effect
<br />
for as long as the operators see fit.
<br />

<br />
Another problem: People have been asking for ops. Let me put this to all of
<br />
you plain and simple. I am not interested in having any more channel
<br />
operators at this time. All of the operators are people that I implicitly
<br />
trust. However, it does not work both ways. Even though I may trust you, it
<br />
does not mean I will op you. It is not some personal thing, so don't think I
<br />
hate you or anything like that. It is this way for EVERYONE.
<br />

<br />
If I have to speak with you in private about a disruption that you might be
<br />
causing, don't think that I don't trust you and I'll hate you forever or
<br />
some other ridiculous thing like that. I will attempt to setlle all problems
<br />
in a mature, civil manner the first time around. If you screw up again, then
<br />
I'll be pissed off. Believe me, if you piss me off, I will let you know in
<br />
the form of a kick, or maybe even a flood that will break your connection
<br />
with your IRC server. (You can get back on again, but I don't think you'd
<br />
want to deal with me when you get back. I suggest you wait at least a day
<br />
for me to cool off.)
<br />

<br />
If anyone has any concerns about what goes on #sonic, by all means, let me
<br />
know. If I'm not there and some catastrophe happens, then E-mail me and tell
<br />
me about it. If you are being annoyed by another user, let me know,
<br />
especially if I'm there with you. If it happens when I'm not there, then try
<br />
to get that person's E-mail address by FINGERing them. (It's under CTCP for
<br />
you mIRC users.) If you don't get any information by doing this, make note
<br />
of their user_at_host information and their nick. Then, send me an e-mail
<br />
telling me what happened, including their nick and user_at_host. (An e-mail
<br />
address would be most helpful, if you can get it.)
<br />

<br />
As mad as I am about these problems, I should also say that the majority of
<br />
you that come on the channel really make my day. Many of you have been great
<br />
on the channel. It makes my job worthwhile, and I've even forged some new
<br />
friendships. Keep it up, all of you!
<br />

<br />
Please notice that I did not name any names in this post. That's because
<br />
there have been several people responsible for everything that I've
<br />
mentioned. If you're responsible for something that I've mentioned, knock it
<br />
off and act semi-normal when you come to #sonic. 
<br />

<br />
I apologize for making such a LENGTHY post, but this seemed to be the best
<br />
way to get everybody's attention. If you have not read the WWW pages, then
<br />
GO DO IT. Looks Like I'll be making more updates shortly to include some of
<br />
the stuff that I've mentioned in this post.
<br />

<br />
As always, I am open to feedback. DO NOT DISCUSS THIS ON THE MAILING LIST,
<br />
PLEASE. Any concerns should be directed to me privately. My e-mail address
<br />
is in my signature.
