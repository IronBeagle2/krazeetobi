<br />
Return from the future, to the present at 0800 hours...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik and Packbell arrived at the crash site in Robotnik's
<br />
personal Hover Unit.  They had retrieved not only the
<br />
linguistics program, they also selected WorkerBots for a small
<br />
squad.  WorkerBots were much more adept at performing the
<br />
required delicate work on the probe and its cargo than the
<br />
SWATBots were constructed and programmed to exercise.  Packbell
<br />
personally took responsibility for dispatching the WorkerBots
<br />
and assigning them to their required duties.  Robotnik remained
<br />
in his command chair, watching them disperse to their positions.
<br />
&nbsp;He reveled in the absolute beauty in the weapon, even though he
<br />
had no knowledge of what specific function it had.  He didn't
<br />
concern himself with what the weapon was utilized for, as long
<br />
as it would aid him in turning the tide of the war in his favor.
<br />
&nbsp;Today could very well become a rather productive day after all.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without any provocation that was visible to Robotnik, an
<br />
explosion occurred somewhere outside to the west of his personal
<br />
Hover Unit.  It was very loud, and somewhat familiar, but he was
<br />
unable to identify who or what could generate that level of
<br />
thundering out of nowhere.  The answer struck him when the
<br />
windshield shattered about a second later from the massive wind
<br />
shear.  There was no other explanation;  it had to be a certain
<br />
blue spiny Freedom Fighter that Robotnik had learned to despise
<br />
and fear in the past eleven years.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sonic, and more specifically, the shock wave generated
<br />
by him that gave Robotnik the first and final warning.  After
<br />
departing from the temporal displacement singularity, Sonic
<br />
sustained his entry velocity, due to the fact that his inertia
<br />
was too high for him to decelerate immediately.  To allow
<br />
himself to do so, Sonic circled the probe's position at a radius
<br />
of three km.  Even from that distance, the hedgehog could view
<br />
the evidence that his warped air cone was wrecking havoc all
<br />
over the probe site.  Hover Units were under take-off condition,
<br />
and then spun around erratically during and after the wave
<br />
impacted with their hulls.  Some SWATBots were vacuumed into the
<br />
air, eventually bashing into other SWATBots or Hover Units.
<br />
Windows shattered, and electrical explosions emitted from
<br />
over-stressed hardware.  Fortunately, WorkerBots weren't present
<br />
in the metallic storm.  Decelerating to a sufficient pace, he
<br />
moved in for the fatal strike, like a Terran lion on the final
<br />
assault for disoriented prey.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic darted toward his general target area, and reached the
<br />
outer rim of Hover Units in about five seconds.  Sally had
<br />
managed to retain her life-grip on Sonic, using every bit of
<br />
energy she had available in her body to prevent her from
<br />
becoming an abandoned piece of debris in the hedgehog's warped
<br />
air cone.  Sonic located and halted in front of Robotnik's Hover
<br />
Unit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Robuttnik,&quot; he said observantly, &quot;nice looking windshield.
<br />
&nbsp;Must be part of your latest stealth technology.&quot;  Looking past
<br />
the remains of the windshield, he said, &quot;Ooohhh, mando cool look
<br />
on the insides.  Are fried control boards and circuits in?&quot;  To
<br />
Sally, he ordered in a whisper, &quot;You can get off now, Sal.
<br />
Hedgehog Express has stopped.&quot;  She released her grip and moved
<br />
to stand by him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik could only stare at the two Freedom Fighters with an
<br />
expression full of anger, bafflement, and fear simultaneously
<br />
displayed.  Observing their condition after a few seconds,
<br />
Robotnik regained a small degree of his own macabre humor at the
<br />
sight of something that looked like it was a costume for a mud
<br />
monster movie.  His evil grin came out of his shocked face, but
<br />
only a little.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Hedgehog,&quot; he dictated in a voice that attempted to
<br />
sound authoritative and failed, &quot;been playing in the mud have
<br />
you?  I thought that was below you;  I guess I was mistaken.
<br />
Where have you been?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog retaliated with a confident strike, &quot;Oh, just
<br />
tromping across a mud pit that doesn't exist yet.&quot;  He chuckled
<br />
at the thought, knowing that Robotnik would have no such memory
<br />
of the incident.  In the technicalities of temporal physics, it
<br />
had not occurred yet in this time period.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik nearly resumed his multispectrum stare, but caught
<br />
himself before he became victim to his shock.  He sank into his
<br />
dark and devious regard that notoriously struck instant fear
<br />
into Freedom Fighters.  &quot;Never mind that,&quot; his voice all gravel
<br />
and almost unnoticeable.  He amplified his voice, maintaining
<br />
the same tone, to say, &quot;SWATBots!  Get that hedgehog!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the remaining SWATBots came out of their stealthy positions
<br />
and moved toward Sonic and Sally.  Sonic quickly scanned the
<br />
immediate area, not exactly pleased with the odds.  Robotnik
<br />
transformed his dangerous frown into a lethal grin as the
<br />
SWATBots gradually decreased the distance to their quarry.
<br />
Sonic and Sally huddled, backs together, looking for an opening
<br />
in the circle of SWATBots.  They found no such escape route.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doesn't look good, Sal,&quot; the hedgehog observed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right about that.  Got any ideas?&quot; Sally queried.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly searched his memory regarding how to handle the
<br />
situation.  He snapped his fingers, with what little snapping he
<br />
could do due to the mud on his fingers.  &quot;As a matter of fact,&quot;
<br />
he confirmed, &quot;I do.  Hold tight, these 'bots are gonna be
<br />
hittin' the rocks.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a second, Sonic created a twenty-meter high blue tornado
<br />
around Sally, providing refuge for her.  Everything outside the
<br />
eye of this storm however, was not so fortunate.  Sonic finished
<br />
off the rest of the SWATBots and Hover Units, turning them into
<br />
scrap metal and plastics, while leaving the probe and Robotnik's
<br />
Hover Unit undamaged.  Satisfied with his work, he revectered
<br />
himself in the opposite direction to quiet the whirlwind that he
<br />
formed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After returning to his position by Sally, Sonic directed an
<br />
evil grin at Robotnik and said, &quot;Need any more convincing,
<br />
Robotnik?  Or do I need to really get serious?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik wasn't taking the hedgehog seriously, however.
<br />
&quot;You're going to have to do better than that, Hedgehog,&quot; he
<br />
sneered with all the intensity he could provide.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Sally, he said with a note of derision and superiority
<br />
directed to Robotnik, &quot;Doesn't he ever get tired?&quot;  Sally could
<br />
only smile and shrug with an &quot;I don't know&quot; motion.  &quot;Well, I
<br />
do,&quot; he continued, &quot;and if this doesn't convince him, I don't
<br />
know what will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that said, he generated another vortex, only this time
<br />
directed toward the WorkerBots and Packbell located in the
<br />
probe.  After finding a suitable opening in the probe, Sonic
<br />
vacuumed up and transferred the robots from the probe to
<br />
Robotnik's personal Hover Unit.  With that done, his disengaged
<br />
his artificial vortex and returned to his position by Sally for
<br />
a second time.  He crossed his arms defiantly, glared at
<br />
Robotnik, and waited for a response.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No further verbal exchange or demonstration of will was
<br />
necessary between the two adversaries.  Sonic was clearly the
<br />
victor in this case, and Robotnik had no way to regain control.
<br />
He had lost yet again to the teenage blue hedgehog.  His Hover
<br />
Unit promptly made an unfashionable retreat, with all available
<br />
power utilized for propulsion, should the hedgehog decide to
<br />
make his unspoken threat a reality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Robotnik's departure, Sonic felt all his energy supplied
<br />
from the adrenaline pour out of him like water from a waterfall.
<br />
&nbsp;Without any power to even support his balance, Sonic tilted and
<br />
fell like a freshly cut tree.  Sally saw his travel to the
<br />
ground and managed to catch him before he impacted with the
<br />
solid granite.  She looked into his eyes, her face filled with
<br />
concern.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic opened his eyes, and saw his friend's worried mask
<br />
through the mud that covered it.  &quot;I'm OK, Sal,&quot; he said weakly,
<br />
&quot;Going after old 'Buttnik like that wore me out more than I
<br />
thought.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not totally convinced, she helped him regain his standing
<br />
position, still providing as much physical and psychological
<br />
support as possible.  She was surprised that he had been able to
<br />
expend that much power for so long.  Anyone else would have more
<br />
than likely dropped dead with the extreme exhaustion.  Then
<br />
again, Sonic wasn't an average hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you've got to stop and rest for a while,&quot; she advised
<br />
him.  &quot;You haven't eaten anything for a long time.  I'll see if
<br />
I can dig something up out of my ration pack.  There has to be
<br />
something in there somewhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No bravado response from the hedgehog for that statement.
<br />
Sonic was the prime example of someone serious, and wasn't
<br />
inclined to engage in his usual cavorting attitude.  This meant
<br />
that something was REALLY wrong with her friend.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No time,&quot; he responded, with the sobriety of voice and mind as
<br />
stable as hydrogen gas at absolute zero.  &quot;We've got to destroy
<br />
that machine, now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic gradually regained a small degree of strength, then
<br />
gently pushed Sally away, making his intentions clear with his
<br />
body language that his words and judgment were the end of any
<br />
further argument over delaying the mission plans.  He had every
<br />
intention to destroy the temporal displacement device, even if
<br />
the effort killed him.  Mobius would be saved, no matter what
<br />
condition Sonic was in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He slowly advanced toward the device that was (or in this case
<br />
of time, would be) the cause of all their problems.  Sally
<br />
walked beside him, keeping her pace equal to his in case he
<br />
should fall again.  He maintained his balance the entire ten
<br />
meters to the probe, and the remaining five meters to the
<br />
weapon's protective shield control panel.  The hedgehog was
<br />
beleaguered, but not out yet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally,&quot; he said finally, with an infinitely tired but
<br />
determined voice, &quot;does Nicole understand the circuits under
<br />
this control panel?&quot;  After receiving an affirmative nod from
<br />
his friend, he carefully retrieved Nicole from her and focused
<br />
all his attention on the little computer.  &quot;Nicole,&quot; he
<br />
commanded, getting some of his more jovial voice back, &quot;pull
<br />
that shield off.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Accessing circuit pathways,&quot; Nicole replied.  She emitted a
<br />
tone afterwards, and said, &quot;Circuits inoperative.  Power
<br />
required to engage the necessary hardware and software.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's face did not alter its form with that statement.  He
<br />
searched his mind for what he knew about power supplies.  'So
<br />
that's it,' he thought, 'Robotnik must have had some portable
<br />
power cells around while he was using the computers.  The
<br />
probe's power supply must be down.'  He searched the immediate
<br />
area for a clue, and found a suspiciously large conduit along
<br />
the left (relative to his position) wall.  The conduit connected
<br />
to a metallic sphere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's this, Nicole?&quot; he asked the small computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is an impulse power unit, utilized for the probe's
<br />
propulsion or for auxiliary power.&quot; she responded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do we get it working again?&quot; queried the serious and
<br />
interested hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The impulse power unit requires matter/antimatter reactants as
<br />
a power source.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's heart sank with that statement.  To come all this way,
<br />
only to be beaten by advanced and specialized hardware!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;However,&quot; Nicole continued, &quot;the unit may be able to utilize a
<br />
power ring if the level input is controlled and monitored.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having no words of his own to contribute, Sonic opened the
<br />
impulse power unit and inserted his power ring.  He kept his
<br />
hands in contact with the power ring, to provide input
<br />
regulation and avoid destroying the hardware from uncontrolled
<br />
levels of energy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally,&quot; Sonic called to his friend, &quot;take it from here.  I'm
<br />
going to take care of the power supply.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally ran over to Nicole, picked her up, and returned to the
<br />
control panel.  After taking her position, she gave her friend a
<br />
&quot;go ahead&quot; signal.  The hedgehog confirmed his by concentrating
<br />
on the power ring.  The energy input began as a minuscule spark
<br />
at first, and then gradually gained strength with every passing
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally remotely monitored the energy input into the computers.
<br />
When the power reached the required minimum level, she called to
<br />
her comrade, &quot;Keep it there, Sonic.&quot;  She noticed that Sonic was
<br />
straining to keep the power level stable, but he contributed no
<br />
complaints in regard to his welfare.  To Nicole, she said,
<br />
&quot;Nicole, remove the shield.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Accessing, Sally,&quot; Nicole replied.  &quot;Circuit pathways
<br />
connected.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that confirmation came the nearly quiet action of
<br />
electromagnetic repulsors slowly removing the protective shield
<br />
from the temporal displacement device's haven.  Once the shield
<br />
had retracted completely, the computers disengaged the power
<br />
supplied to the subunits controlling the shield placement
<br />
system.  The device was now exposed for its atrocity, and would
<br />
return payment with its destruction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic disabled his power transfer and slowly trudged over to
<br />
Sally's position.  He glared at the large object ahead of him
<br />
with malignance, and said to her, &quot;This thing goes down, today.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute, Sonic,&quot; as she checked over the device's
<br />
ambient power levels.  &quot;We have to discharge the energy cells
<br />
that power the particle controls.  If we destroy it now, the
<br />
explosion could do the same to Mobius.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where's the energy cells?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally checked the schematics for them.  &quot;They're under the
<br />
case, located in the center of the top circuit board.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can I cut through that metal, Sally?&quot; the hedgehog asked, for
<br />
he noticed that the metal was unlike anything he had ever seen
<br />
before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She analyzed the case's composition, and confirmed his request.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;No problem, Sonic.  Are you sure you want to do this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He replied with a question of his own.  &quot;Is there another way?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She checked for anything that might assist in opening the
<br />
protective case, for repair points, places for hardware
<br />
upgrades, and other possible openings.  Finding none, she shook
<br />
her head as if to say &quot;no&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that confirmation, Sonic raised his power ring and
<br />
concentrated on transferring its energy to his body.  At his low
<br />
organic power state, the power ring and what he wanted to
<br />
destroy became the only existing objects besides him in his
<br />
personal universe.  The power ring now supplied nearly all of
<br />
Sonic's energy;  without it, he would be little more than a
<br />
vegetable.  He rolled into a ball, and let his spiny back
<br />
perform the task for him.  With part of the case shredded off,
<br />
he leaped to the center of the top circuit board, where the
<br />
energy cells were located.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A faint, familiar voice called out to him from the darkness.
<br />
&quot;Look for the two largest wires in front of you.  Short them
<br />
together.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic found a black and red wire.  He pulled them with what
<br />
strength he had left from their sockets.  Finding the bare,
<br />
uninsulated copper, he shorted the connections.  The energy
<br />
cells responded with a hum, which steadily increased in volume
<br />
with every second.  Not the desired effect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The familiar voice called to him again, now screaming.  &quot;It's
<br />
going to explode!  Get away from there, Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's mind raced, thinking of ways to avert the imminent
<br />
explosion that would take place.  One solution came to mind.
<br />
The only alternative to the destruction of Mobius.  He raised
<br />
his power ring above him, positioning it perpendicular to the
<br />
ground.  He concentrated once again on the power ring as his
<br />
other hand wrapped around the improvised shorted connection he
<br />
made a few seconds before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blinding flash of light emanated from the power ring.  Sally
<br />
shielded her eyes as she attempted to see what act the hedgehog
<br />
was performing.  He was using himself and the power ring as a
<br />
power transfer point, venting all the energy from the energy
<br />
cells to space.  The immense power that surged through him and
<br />
the strain to dissipate that energy nearly threw him away from
<br />
the circuits, as if the temporal displacement device wanted to
<br />
live.  Sonic maintained a firm hold on the wires, not allowing
<br />
himself to be subdued by the power that would otherwise advance
<br />
toward a catastrophic explosion.  The power ring provided some
<br />
protection, but it didn't provide immunity to the device's
<br />
retaliation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When all the power was drained from the energy cells, Sonic
<br />
began the next phase of the operation.  Still clinging to his
<br />
power ring, the hedgehog reached his other hand into his
<br />
backpack, and it produced three timed-explosive charges.  There
<br />
would be more than enough energy unleashed to destroy the device
<br />
and the probe, if they were positioned correctly.  He activated
<br />
them all simultaneously, then dropped to the floor of the probe
<br />
and placed them where they would insure the total fragmentation
<br />
of the machine that would have caused so much trouble for
<br />
Mobius.  After retrieving Sally for the escape from the
<br />
near-future blast radius, he raised his power ring for the last
<br />
time, then dashed away into the distance.  Five seconds later,
<br />
the probe and its cargo no longer existed on Mobius.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Knothole Freedom Fighters saw the explosion from about
<br />
three km away from ground zero.  Mobius was safe again, for at
<br />
least one more day.  It had been the first assault from space,
<br />
and it was successfully deterred.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there was one war that day which would claim a life.
<br />
Sonic was near death, his power ring almost dimmed from the
<br />
extensive energy demands that the hedgehog made from it.  He was
<br />
surprised that it had lasted for so long, but Charles Hedgehog
<br />
had designed them well.  Their life was also his life;  just as
<br />
their death was also a mutual demise.  He took one last look at
<br />
the carnage that destroyed their ultimate adversary of the day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally noticed that the power ring was dimming, synchronous with
<br />
Sonic's life force which was slowly slipping away.  She knew
<br />
what was happening, and was unable to ease her friend's pain or
<br />
prevent the shadow of death receiving final payment.  She held
<br />
him, looked into his eyes, and kissed him passionately.  They
<br />
both knew that this was the last time in this universe that this
<br />
particular pair of Freedom Fighters would have the opportunity
<br />
to be together.  Their counterparts, the Sonic and Sally
<br />
synchronous with time, would never know what happened.  The
<br />
mission was a success, but a price had to be paid.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the payment was extracted, with no concern for emotion.
<br />
Sonic's payment came a few seconds after their last
<br />
demonstration of affection.  Sally felt his body turn cold, and
<br />
saw his eyes permanently close.  Sally gently lowered Sonic to
<br />
the ground, weeping for both of them.  Sonic had met his death,
<br />
but he went down fighting every step of the way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She buried the savior of Mobius in the best way she knew how,
<br />
with the limited materials available in the Great Unknown.  She
<br />
regarded his grave, knowing that with time, she too would cease
<br />
to exist in this universe.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Sonic's talk with Dulcy, and receiving a demonstration of
<br />
her unflagging humor, he and Sally rushed off to the probe's
<br />
crash site.  The arrived without incident, but noticed that
<br />
something was not there to greet their eyes.  The only evidence
<br />
that the probe and the cargo it carried existed was a large
<br />
black circular mark on the rock where it landed.  There was no
<br />
evidence that Robotnik had ever been there, since the remains of
<br />
the SWATBots and Hover Units had been vaporized in the blast
<br />
zone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What d'ya suppose happened, Sal?&quot; queried the totally baffled
<br />
hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hard to say, Sonic,&quot; was her only reply, for she was as much
<br />
at a loss for words as Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, so much for another wartoy that old 'Buttnik could've
<br />
used.  Sure would've liked to know what it was though,&quot; Sonic
<br />
said, trying to solve the mystery of the day and failing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So would have I,&quot; said Sally.  &quot;But I guess some things are
<br />
better left in the past.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic signaled to Dulcy for a retrieval.  The pair would never
<br />
know how much truth there was to Sally's last philosophical
<br />
statement.
