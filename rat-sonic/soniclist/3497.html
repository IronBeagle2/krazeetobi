Subject: Thank-you's and what-not
<br />

<br />
Well, following Matt's cue, I think I'm going to HAVE to thank everyone
<br />
who's made my participation in this wonderful world worth my time.  So,
<br />
here they are, in no particular order:
<br />

<br />
Dan Drazen: You're the best author ever to grace Sonicdom.  Keep 'em
<br />
comin'!  I look forward (well, actually BACKWARD, as my issues come fairly
<br />
late) to your monthly critiques of the Archie comic.
<br />

<br />
Ken Penders: Thanks for your thoughtful comments on our comic discussions,
<br />
and also for keeping me from cancelling my subscription with your art and
<br />
co-authorship on the monthly Knuckles mini-series preludes.
<br />

<br />
Eric Goodwin: Your contribution to Sonic '94-'96 was quite appreciated.
<br />
Thanks for the utmost flattery in asking for my opinions while you worked
<br />
on Sir Kain's Story.  Plus (no pun intended), you were the ONLY ONE who
<br />
listened to me when I said to get the BBNM; thus YOUR Prodigy account,
<br />
unlike the others', was terminated by choice, not due to fees.
<br />

<br />
Simon Howes: You made me re-examine my approach to stories (well...okay, so
<br />
you sorta just made me MAD, but I felt like saying that anyway).  Besides
<br />
that, it was VERY generous of you to let ME be the one to save Mobius in
<br />
Mobian GPF.  (BTW...How DID you know so much about me in that story?!  You
<br />
had my brother's character PERFECT, and it SEEMS like you knew that Dave
<br />
lives relatively close to me, so I WOULD be the most logical choice to send
<br />
the frozen Jell-O cube to...)
<br />

<br />
Dave Pistone: Thanks for providing a haven for everybody's fanfic.  Of all
<br />
the WWW pages I've seen, yours is by far my favorite.  Also, thanks for not
<br />
complaining when I took your character and wrote an origin story for him
<br />
that was somewhat contradictory to what you'd set down &lt;glares at Brent
<br />
Roberts&gt;...finally, thanks for correcting the minor errors you made in your
<br />
presentation of The Hunt Begins.  When Prodigy gets Telnet (they're working
<br />
on it as I type this), I'll be sure to check out your BBS...I wish I could
<br />
go there with just a normal comm prog, but oh well...
<br />

<br />
Doug LoConti: Thanks for bein' such a help in Mettle...sorry I haven't
<br />
really helped, despite being on the team.  BTW, *I* was going to create a
<br />
character profiles page, but you beat me to it...great minds think alike.  8)
<br />

<br />
Matt Penna: Thanks for almost seven years (well, I guess about five, as you
<br />
said, when you take away the two I was gone) of friendship.  When Prod gets
<br />
IRC, I'll see you there.  8)  Keep in touch, ol' buddy.
<br />

<br />
Brent Roberts: Thank you SO much for not being on the list!!!
<br />

<br />
Erich: Thanks for puttin' up with the lot of us.
<br />

<br />
Ratman: You gave us this virtual community...thank you from the bottom of
<br />
my heart.
<br />

<br />
Lindsay Cibos: You're not a subscriber anymore, but you STILL deserve to be
<br />
recognized by everyone who IS.  You introduced me to this whole thing, and
<br />
you were ALSO the first to join me as a Chrono Trigger fanatic...&lt;VBG&gt;
<br />

<br />
Everyone who's written fanfic: You've given me hours of enjoyment, and also
<br />
insight to my own stories.
<br />

<br />
Anyone I haven't mentioned: You've all contributed to making this a
<br />
wonderful environment...thanks SO much.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Thank you all.  It's been real!
<br />
