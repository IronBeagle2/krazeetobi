Some person subject to &lt;persuasion&gt; dared to insult our blue, leader, his 
<br />
text has been &lt;removed&gt; as he too will be. hehehe &lt;selected&gt;
<br />

<br />

<br />
I Don't believe it.. *I* said this is repsonse:
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Q. Has anyone ever seen Captain-N.. It's kinda odd really though, and this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;has to be said. That way before Sonic.. there was a storyline about some
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;princess who's father was sent to another world, a hero rocks up.. and we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;meet all sorts of characters... a buffoon, a clever and strong hero, a young
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;kid with the ability to fly.. heheh. well you get the idea..    Mmmmm.. I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;always did wonder that.. but don't flame me.. I personally prefer the Sonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;storyline..
</em><br />

<br />
And Matt,(The guy with the 'plushies' responded)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This guy is a whacko. I gave up on this kind of negativism a long time ago.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It's pointless and only creates enemies. Hopefully we won't be hearing from
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;Clarkmeister&quot; again anytime soon. 
</em><br />

<br />
Hmm.. I have his email adress and perhaps I will do something to him, after all,
<br />
I do have a lot of good software to try out. No virus's though, stuff like
<br />
hypnotizers (trying to control my family), and some other great mind-mashers.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;By the way, Ablater, I remember that show. It wasn't bad, but you're right;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;those are interesting parallels.....but who knows? Everything's stolen
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nowadays, anyway. Either that, or things are just heavily borrowed from.
</em><br />

<br />
Here's an interesting idea, imagine the N-Team goes to Mobius, or perhaps Sonic
<br />
rocks up in Videoland.. Of course it would have to been fanfic to survive (C)
<br />
but it could be real cool. (Imagine Robotnik meating Mother Brain!)
<br />
Or perhaps Simon (Belmond not Howes) meating Antoine, 
<br />
Sonic and Kevin showing off, 
<br />
the princess's,
<br />
Rotor and Megaman,
<br />
Tails and Kid Icarus... Hmmm.. Snively and Dr Wiley... WOW!
<br />

<br />
So anyone want to write it.. Actually I have already written a story like
<br />
this, but it was a satire, David Pistone ends up in Mobius after he escapes the 
<br />
'M-Team' (Who are ticked that he wears a STH shirt) Well.. I guess you should
<br />
read it.. but it's kinda weird, that's the reason why it's only 90% complete,
<br />
if someone requests it, I will finish it.. Oh yeah, sorry for ripping you off
<br />
Bookshire.. hehehe.. I expect to recieve a message to you.. Ohya.. while yer
<br />
at it.. what happened to the stories I posted you.. [WAAAAA!]
<br />

<br />
Now about &quot;Clarkmeister&quot; perhaps he's only seen the Syndicated series, after all
<br />
I was kinda like him.. And I'm not a nutcase-- Oh shit.. forgot I am.. well,
<br />
perhaps if he knew the storyline he might become a nice guy.. or at least
<br />
chance his positioning.. if not then we simply lock my moron mailer on him
<br />
and send 
<br />
pointless messages for eternity. Ohya. If anyone wants I send you my Sonic Doom 
<br />
patch, it'll turn troopers into Tails, and Imps into Sonic. 
<br />
(I still find it funny, even after becoming a sympathiser..) 
<br />
Ohya as the CyberDemon I put myself in.. it looks real cool.. I think nothing
<br />
compares to the rush of shooting your evil clone to death!
<br />

<br />
Imagine K. Acorn and that Nintendo King dude playing chess in the void!
<br />

<br />
Cheers
<br />
Ablater
