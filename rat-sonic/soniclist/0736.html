<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams was sitting in his chair, looking through some files when his
<br />
train of thought was broken by his computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Incoming visual transmission,&quot; it reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would anybody contact him?  The only person who knows he's here is
<br />
Sonic, but why now?  The only other person who could contact him was...Adam!
<br />
&quot;Computer, answer it!&quot;  A hologram of a very familiar numbat appeared before
<br />
him.  &quot;Adam!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It seems you ARE alive,&quot; noticed Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What happened?  Why didn't you contact me before?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a long story.  Why didn't YOU contact me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I tried.  You never answered.  I assumed you were roboticized but
<br />
couldn't find you.  That left but one alternative: death.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I kinda had my computer 'confiscated.'  But, obviously, I got it
<br />
back.  You have NO idea what we went through to get out of this mess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WE?  You mean--&quot;  A familiar paca stepped into the display.  &quot;Kristen!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm so happy to finally see you again!&quot; she exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine now.  At one point I fell out of air duct.  I don't remember
<br />
exactly what happened, but Adam says I broke my leg.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You should've seen it!&quot;  Adam tried to describe the situation.  &quot;Thirty
<br />
or forty foot drop, knocked unconscious, leg broken right in half, blood
<br />
everywhere.  We were being chased so I--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chased?&quot;  Williams thought that to be strange.  &quot;By who?  I though
<br />
Robotnik was gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Apparently some Swat-bots are still here.  Anyway, we were being chased
<br />
so I had to climb down and get her out of there.  By the time I got there,
<br />
the bleeding stopped.  I picked her up and brought her to the safest place I
<br />
could find.  I just stuck the leg back in place and within two hours the
<br />
entire thing was healed!  Not even a scar!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure you have many more stories that can wait.  Where are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've set up camp outside of Robotropolis, or what's left.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be right there.  Just send me the--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, we'll meet you in Wespero.  It'll be good to be back home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, but hurry.&quot;  The transmission was discontinued.  Williams
<br />
continued his work as he waited.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door burst open and Kristen came running in.  Williams barely had
<br />
enough time to get out of his chair before she pounced on him.  They fell
<br />
to the ground and Williams got a minor bump on his head, but he couldn't
<br />
feel it--he was too busy being kissed by Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm so glad to see you!&quot; she finally stopped and got up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can tell,&quot; noticed Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adam helped him up and they hugged each other as tight as ever.  He
<br />
patted Williams on the back.  &quot;You're alive.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams sat back down.  &quot;Yes, we've established that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;After Robotnik singled you out, I though that was the end of you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nah, he just wanted to interrogate me.  Nothing I couldn't handle.
<br />
What's your story?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The rest of us were either executed or roboticized, depending on how
<br />
well we behaved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They shot my mother,&quot; Kristen told him.  &quot;Right there, right in front of
<br />
me.  They just shot her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams knew what this meant.  &quot;Kristen?  You okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot; She broke into tears.  &quot;They shot her!&quot;  She needed a shoulder to
<br />
cry on and Williams was there for her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What happened?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Swat-bot ordered her to cooperate, but she didn't.&quot;  Adam explained it
<br />
for Kristen.  &quot;She fought it, but lost.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams started to laugh.  He was the only one laughing.  &quot;I can't
<br />
imagine Helen going up against a Swat-bot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen always wondered how he could just shake these things off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Kristen.&quot;  Williams tried to remedy the situation.  &quot;Best friends
<br />
are reunited after each one thought the other was dead.  We're supposed to
<br />
laugh at each other's anecdotes, not dwell on the morbid aspects of our
<br />
adventures.  Don't you see?  WE are what's left of this village, WE
<br />
survived, WE won.  Don't you feel...special?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took a while, but she eventually calmed down.  &quot;I guess you're right.
<br />
You know, one time--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm sure it's a great story, but there's no time.  We're off to the
<br />
Great Unknown.&quot;  Williams began to pack up his things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But we just got here,&quot; complained Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams ignored him.  &quot;I've found a way to open the void.  We're going
<br />
to test my theory.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why in the Great Unknown?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In case anything goes wrong, nothing important will be sucked in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're always so optimistic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You coming?&quot;  Williams directed his question to Kristen who was sitting
<br />
on his bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I--&quot; she sniffled, &quot;I'll stay here.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; inquired Adam, &quot;what now?&quot;  They were in the middle of nowhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; ordered Williams, &quot;open 'the void' about four hundred feet in
<br />
front of me.&quot;  It took a while, but soon a bright yellow and purple helix
<br />
appeared in front of him.  &quot;You want to go in first?&quot; he gave Adam the
<br />
honor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's okay.  You opened it, you go in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I'll send some nanites in first.&quot;  Before he could instruct his
<br />
computer to do anything, a scaly, six legged, thirty foot tall, six inch
<br />
teeth, razor sharp clawed, insect-like animal came out of the void first.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, now you've done it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe it's friendly.&quot;  Williams started to walk toward it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It noticed the two appetizers and let out a roar in their direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Or not.  Computer, close 'the void.'&quot;  It did.  &quot;Hellooooo!&quot; he called.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It roared back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Doesn't seem to be all that intelligent,&quot; noticed Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; ordered Williams, &quot;send out some nanites to stun
<br />
the...uh...the creature and give me a progress report.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nanites released,&quot; reported his computer.  About a minute later,
<br />
&quot;Nanites have infected host.&quot;  A few seconds later, &quot;Nanites have been
<br />
destroyed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It started to walk toward them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Adam, I suggest we make a strategic retreat to Wespero.&quot;  They both took
<br />
off running.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature chased after them.  Although it could run fast (compared to
<br />
most Mobian animals), it got tired quickly.  There was too little carbon
<br />
dioxide in the air.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're never going to believe what happened,&quot; Williams said as he sat
<br />
down on his bed.  &quot;A, uh, creature came through the void.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A 'creature?'&quot;  Kristen looked to Adam for some sort of confirmation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't look at me.  I'm not the one who conjured it up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does it look like?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I'd say it's a cross between a dragon and an ant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it was hungry,&quot; added Williams, &quot;it started to chase us.  I
<br />
tried to stun it with some nanites, but they were all destroyed before they
<br />
could do anything.  It must have a super immune system.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where is it now?&quot; asked Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good question.  Computer, where is the creature?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Near the Great Forest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Probably found something to eat,&quot; said Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Considering the size of its teeth, I think it's carnivorous,&quot; stated
<br />
Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Could be omnivorous,&quot; contributed Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever the case, it's not supposed to be here.  We need to find a way
<br />
to send it back or kill it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's not a computer, you can't control it.  Nanites are useless, you
<br />
can't kill it.  This isn't going to be easy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then we get some help.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was on lookout, sweeping the horizon with his binoculars.  He
<br />
stopped and backed up, something caught his eye.  It was far, far away.
<br />
He switched to a higher magnification to take a closer look.  There was a
<br />
big rock sitting at the edge of the forest.  It was strange to see a rock
<br />
that was never there before, but even more strange to see it move.  His eyes
<br />
were not deceiving him--the rock moved.  From past experience, he knew that
<br />
rocks did not move on their own.  He kept observing it.  A head popped up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sooooonic!  SOOOOONIC!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic came racing up to meet him.  &quot;What is it, big guy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails handed him the binoculars and pointed in the rock's general
<br />
direction.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saw what Tails had seen.  &quot;What's THAT?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Keep watching.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic observed the rock a bit more and saw the head pop up for a moment,
<br />
then back down.  &quot;I'm gonna check it out.&quot;  And he did.  In under ten
<br />
seconds, he was standing in front of the rock.  &quot;Mondo weird.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature heard him coming and turned to look at the tiny, blue
<br />
animal.  Its target was in range and it spit at him.  Direct hit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!&quot;  Sonic was covered in a cloudy, sticky substance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creature, however, was confused.  Usually when it hits another
<br />
animal, the animal gets stunned instantly, ready to eat.  It roared at him.
<br />
Sonic could see a vast array of sharp teeth.  For a moment, he stood
<br />
motionless.  The creature snapped at him.  Sonic jumped out of the way and
<br />
left for Knothole.  He had seen enough.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal!&quot;  He ran up in front of her.  &quot;Sal, there's something--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A monster in the forest?  Tails already told me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It spit on me!&quot;  He wiped some off.  &quot;What is this stuff, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally reached down and detached Nicole from her boot.  &quot;Nicole,&quot; Sally
<br />
flipped her open, &quot;what is the substance that Sonic is covered in?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sugar saturated water.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What kind of an animal is this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A big one,&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd like to go see it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you crazy!?!  That thing's dangerous!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, it spits sugar.  How dangerous can it be?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic shook himself off and took Sally to see the creature.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She found out just how dangerous it could be when she was standing in
<br />
front of it.  She saw for herself how big its teeth and claws were. &quot;Nicole,
<br />
full scan on the creature.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scanning...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Keep it busy until Nicole's done,&quot; she told Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic ran around to the creature's head.  It spat at him.  He ran
<br />
underneath it to its tail.  It slashed at him with one of its feet.  He ran
<br />
around to its side.  It turned to face him and snapped at him.  Again he
<br />
ran to one side.  This time the creature, realizing what was going on,
<br />
whacked Sally against a tree with its tail.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blow from the tail broke a couple of ribs and punctured a lung in the
<br />
process.  The tree gave her a nice-sized concussion, shattered a shoulder
<br />
blade, and fractured a vertebra or two.  Sonic immediately ran over,
<br />
gathered up Sally and Nicole (which just made things worse for Sally, but
<br />
was better than being eaten), and took off for Knothole.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic put Sally down on her bed and went to get Bookshire.  He was in his
<br />
hut.  &quot;Bookshire!  Sally's hurt!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The tone of Sonic's voice was the most obvious signal that something was
<br />
very wrong.  The blood on him was a close second.  He barely had enough time
<br />
to grab his first aid kit before Sonic grabbed him and took him back to
<br />
Sally's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, boy.&quot;  This was a much bigger problem than Sonic led him to believe.
<br />
He panicked, slightly, but remembered to stay calm.  &quot;There's a, uh, box of
<br />
stuff on the table in the, um, far corner of my hut.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was gone and in a few seconds came back with the box.  Bookshire
<br />
took it from him and put it down next to the bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get someone to guard the door,&quot; ordered Bookshire as he removed certain
<br />
items from his first aid kit and his box.  &quot;No one disturbs us until I say
<br />
so.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was gone again.  It took him a little longer this time, but only
<br />
because he had to explain to Rotor, the closest person, what was going on.
<br />
Sonic came back in and closed the door behind him.  He and Bookshire worked
<br />
as fast as they could to keep Sally alive.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Williams and company were now in the Great Forest, on their way to
<br />
Knothole Village.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's so special about this village?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He remembered what happened the last time he was there, &quot;I have...friends
<br />
there.  They might be able to help.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were walking, Sandra stepped out of nowhere and blocked their
<br />
path.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You again,&quot; greeted Williams.  &quot;Who wants me now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No one.  I need your help.  I take it you've noticed the creature?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; answered Kristen.  &quot;Who is this?&quot;  She sounded jealous.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are...old acquaintances.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, we're more than acquaintances.&quot;  Williams smiled at her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She grabbed him by the neck and held him up to her face, &quot;Will you help
<br />
me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm already on my way to Knothole to find some help of my own.&quot;  It was
<br />
hard to talk, his voice was scratchy.  &quot;You're welcome to tag along.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, Sandra would not &quot;tag along&quot; with anybody, but this was
<br />
different.  She dropped him on the ground, &quot;Lead the way.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails had resumed his scan of the horizon before Sonic and Sally left to
<br />
see the creature and was oblivious to the whole &quot;Sally&quot; incident.  He was,
<br />
however, the only one who could see Williams and his band of adventurers
<br />
coming towards Knothole.  He decided to meet them and escort them the rest
<br />
of the way.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Williams!&quot; called Tails.  He landed in front of them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  Look who it is!&quot; replied Williams.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A kid?&quot; asked Adam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't underestimate him.  He just might be able to beat you in a
<br />
net-war.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!?!  No way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I remember correctly, Packbell once referred to him as the 'Supreme
<br />
Emperor of All Time and Space.'  After we take care of this creature, we
<br />
might have a chance to find out who's better.&quot;  Turning to Tails, &quot;Anyway,
<br />
where's the princess?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU know the princess?&quot; asked Kristen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but she hates me.&quot;  Back to Tails, &quot;So where is she?&quot;
<br />
