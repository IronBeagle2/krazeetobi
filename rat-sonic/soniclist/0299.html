OK. Here's what I want out of a Sonic game. First, let me give you a 
<br />
little background. My addiction to the Blue one started with the ABC 
<br />
cartoon when it premiered last year. I absolutely fell in love with the 
<br />
storyline and it's what prompted me into buying a Sega. I own Sonic 2, 
<br />
Sonic Spinball, Sonic 3, and have rented Sonic and Knuckles (hope to buy 
<br />
sooner or later). I have also become a fan of the Archie comic.
<br />
Well anyway, here's what I have liked about the Sonic games that I have 
<br />
played:
<br />

<br />
I like the ease of play of all the Sonics. By just using one button, the 
<br />
game can move a a faster pace without being difficult.
<br />

<br />
I like the multiple routes through the levels and the hidden areas. In 
<br />
particular, the Chemical Plant and Oil Ocean zones of Sonic 2 and the 
<br />
Marble Garden and Carnival Night zones of Sonic 3.
<br />

<br />
I like the continual increase in quality of the Sonic games. There is a 
<br />
noticeable improvement in the physics of the game. (In Sonic 2, Sonic 
<br />
would jump straight up, even on a slanted surface, while in Sonic 3 and 
<br />
later, he would jump perpendicular to the surface) Also the improvement 
<br />
in graphics has been well appreciated. (I didn't think that anything 
<br />
could be better than Sonic 3, but Sonic and Knuckles BLEW ME AWAY.)
<br />

<br />
The various shields that were added to the game increased options for 
<br />
game play and stratagy building.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Spinball was a definite change of pace. I am a bit of a pinball 
<br />
fanatic, so I really enjoyed it. I also loved the fact that you did 
<br />
include the characters from the Archie comics, at least in the bonus 
<br />
levels and the game story (I would have loved it more had it been based 
<br />
on the Saturday morning cartoon, but more on that later.)
<br />

<br />
The save game feature is a major plus. pleas include it in future games.
<br />

<br />
And, I love trying to find the debug codes (I know programers don't like 
<br />
to hear that gamers go mucking about in the debug mode, but hey, it's fun)
<br />
I think that the debug code for Sonic 3 was entirely too hard. (Up, Up, 
<br />
Down, Down, Up, Up, Up, Up, in a one second window of time? geez, what 
<br />
did you do, use a programable controler?) I was most satisfied when I 
<br />
finally finished the hidden special stage on Sonic 3 (the blue one that 
<br />
spirals inwards). 
<br />

<br />
I did not like the electric special stage of Sonic and Knuckles. I just 
<br />
couldn't get the knack for it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Now for things that I would really want in the next Sonic game:
<br />

<br />
Fully incorporate the characters from the Saturday Morning cartoon. 
<br />
Possibly have Princess Sally as a playable character. (Make sure that 
<br />
it's the Princess Sally who's coloring matches the Saturday Morning 
<br />
cartoon and the most recent issues of the Archie comic, and not Amy Rose 
<br />
renamed from Sonic CD)
<br />

<br />
Make the game less linear. Give us some freedom to chose different paths, 
<br />
with different levels to play. You've allready taken some steps in that 
<br />
direction with the three different characters that you can play with 
<br />
Sonic 3 locked on to Sonic and Knuckles (Major kudos for that advancement 
<br />
BTW). Depending on if you played Sonic, Tails, or Knuckles, you took 
<br />
different routes through the levels. Just give us the ability to take 
<br />
different levels entirely.
<br />

<br />
Finally, the sugestion that I hear most, from fans and non-fans alike......
<br />

<br />
GIVE TAILS HIS OWN GAME!!!!!!!!
<br />
PLEASE!
<br />

<br />

<br />
I'd like to thank the mailing list for indulging me in posting this for 
<br />
everyone... I did it that way so you could respond to my points about the 
<br />
games. I know not all of you play them that much, and that we never 
<br />
intended for this to be a list about the games, but the games are what's 
<br />
driving the fiction, so we should do our best to make sure that the games 
<br />
are the best that they can be.
<br />
