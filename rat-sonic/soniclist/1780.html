#30 [Jan 1996]
<br />
&quot;The Return of Uncle Chuck&quot;
<br />
Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After two pages of Sonic's reminiscing about Uncle Chuck, we
<br />
dive into the plot.  Robotnik and Snively are preparing to test a
<br />
&quot;transdimensional transporter&quot; [hereinafter &quot;T2&quot;], and are about to
<br />
use Uncle Chuck as a test subject.  Something goes wrong (though
<br />
John Johnston suggests in his review that Snively had this planned
<br />
all along) and Robotnik ends up trapped in the Void.  While Snively
<br />
goes off to show Robotnik how to properly crush a rebellion, there
<br />
is an unforseen consequence of the accident: Uncle Chuck regains
<br />
his consciousness and will.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quick cut to Uncle Chuck's deserted chili dog stand where
<br />
Sonic just happens to be mooning about Uncle Chuck, and where Uncle
<br />
Chuck just happens to pop up.  Before there can be a tearful
<br />
reunion, quick cut to Knothole some time later where Uncle Chuck
<br />
could apparently think of nothing better to do than whomp up a
<br />
batch of chili dogs for the gang before warning them about Snively. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck returns to Robotropolis, where he steals plans Snively
<br />
has drawn up to mount a T2 on the nose of an aircraft.  Sonic and
<br />
Uncle Chuck go after the plane, but Sonic is (for lack of a better
<br />
word) voided.  Snively, with Sonic held as a captive audience, then
<br />
wastes a sizable chunk of the Great Forest before he's shot at from
<br />
another aircraft, this one piloted by Uncle Chuck.  Snively is all
<br />
set to destroy the entire planet out of either spite or bad writing
<br />
when Robotnik drops in on him...literally.  Seems Uncle Chuck got
<br />
him out of the Void in some unspecified way [Can you say &quot;Deus ex
<br />
machina?&quot; I knew you could], and returned him to Mobius on
<br />
condition that Robotnik not harm the freedom fighters.  The cookout
<br />
resumes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This little story has some BIG problems, especially when
<br />
compared with the &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; episode.  In the latter, Uncle
<br />
Chuck's &quot;restoration&quot; is not just an accident or the byproduct of
<br />
an accident.  His building of the holographic diarama of Mobius
<br />
helped establish his scientific credentials; in this story (as well
<br />
as the comics in general) he almost comes off as a glorified short-
<br />
order cook.  Worst of all, there is NO SPACE AT ALL devoted to
<br />
Sonic and Uncle Chuck's reunion despite so much set-up.  Any
<br />
emotional impact has been totally sacrificed.  IMHO, a comic
<br />
adaptation of &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; would have been preferable; it
<br />
would have also given Mawhinney a chance to draw &quot;the Bunnie bod&quot;
<br />
in its entirety, though showing Bunnie in profile at the top of
<br />
page 8 is less than flattering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who Keeps Stealing My Chaos Emeralds?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Paul Castiglia; Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to further safeguard some Chaos Emeralds from a
<br />
thieving &quot;anteater&quot;, Robotnik sends Coconuts to set some traps on
<br />
an island base.  The traps are pure Chuck Jones-Roadrunner stuff
<br />
(and Castiglia does nothing to hide the allusion) and Coconuts
<br />
comes off worse than the shadowy biped &quot;anteater&quot; who (it is
<br />
revealed in the last panel) is Bunnie, making her first appearance
<br />
as a Spaziante subject.  Except for some severe foreshortening of
<br />
her left arm, her depiction should please her fanboys; as for
<br />
keeping her &quot;on model&quot; [see discussion of #29], Spaziante literally
<br />
skirts the issue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic Art
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles' Chaotix Sneak Peek: 2-page splash/tease.  Haven't
<br />
played the game, but I seriously question the existence of Renfield
<br />
the Rodent (who looks too much like a Chicago alderman to suit me).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic Grams: Different artist [Freddy Mendez], same lame
<br />
office humor.  One page of plugs, which includes the information
<br />
that Geoffrey St. John will resurface in Sonic #31, and the return
<br />
of Mecha Sonic as part of the Chaotix special issue.  Also, in
<br />
answer to several questions in a letter, the news that Amy Rose
<br />
will be reappearing at some point.
<br />
