<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: hk512_at_cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Joseph Delacroix)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;To: sonic_at_bort.mv.net
</em><br />
<br />What happened to &quot;sard.mv.net&quot;?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hello there. I'm Joseph from FurToonia, and I've recently discovered this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mailing list.  I'm a rather large Sonic fan, so I was rather dismayed when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I finally realized ABC wasn't carryin StH anymore.  So...
</em><br />
<br />Took you this long, did it?  :^)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;I wrote this message on the bulletin board on FurToonia.  I'm sending it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in a slightly altered form, to this list in hopes of arousing your interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in my plan.
</em><br />
<br />(most of message deleted)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;1.  The final episode.  If the last episode of Sonic the Hedgehog was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    the most extreme cliffhanger in the history of all Saturday morning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    cartoons, I'm not orange.  
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^
<br />
Just what flavor of furry are you? :^)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    Even the SWAT Kats ended with a modicum of closure; all of THEIR bad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    guys were DEAD.  
</em><br />
<br />Interesting; I didn't know that (I gave up on SK since all I was doing was 
<br />
drooling over Callie and Felina, and that's not good for me...)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   What of Snively, and the mysterious eyes behind him?  What happened to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Robotnik?  What about the King?  (Talk about your cartoonus interruptus...) 
</em><br />
<br />Heh!
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2.  This was a *good* show.  It gave all SORTS of good messages.  It was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    pro-environment (the good guys live in peace with nature, badniks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    destroy it), anti-pollution (ditto), 
</em><br />
<br />But it was fairly subtle about it, unlike, say, Captain Planet...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;3.  It was also a &quot;good&quot; show in the respect that it was well-written and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    animated.  Very rarely does such a quality show end up on ABC, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    especially during the SatAM merchandising-block.  It had drama.  Pathos.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    And it was *funny* sometimes, too.  It was a show that anyone of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    age could watch and appreciate on some level.  
</em><br />
<br />The only other one that comes to mind was the first season of Ewoks.
<br />
But actually Reboot has many of the same elements, but it's such a 
<br />
different show that I'm not sure the comparison is valid.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;    And I'm sure these people would gladly buy any products that any sponsor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    of the show would produce, and recommend X product to their friends.
</em><br />
<br />Depends on the product - I don't know about Sonic underwear, cereal, or 
<br />
canned pasta product with imitation cheese :^)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now, here's what I'm thinking here...basically, all we do are these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;three things:
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;2.  Then, a letter should immediately follow the previous message that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    could send to (our main enemy) Sega.  
</em><br />
<br />It has yet to be determined just who the &quot;enemy&quot; is here; Sega, DIC, or ABC.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;   It would be pretty similar to the thesis about why the show is good; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   it would explain why we want Sega to give permission back to DiC to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   StH episodes, and our willingness to fully support them if they do.  (If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   we need to write a 2nd letter, this will be slightly more threatening.)
</em><br />
<br />Here's where I have a problem; &quot;threats&quot; never work, especially when 
<br />
they're idle ones; just _how_ would you &quot;threaten&quot; them?  There's nothing 
<br />
to boycott, which is all they care about.  The only possible exception is 
<br />
the video games, and let's face it, most fans of the show and/or comic 
<br />
either have already bought all the video games they're going to, or they 
<br />
don't buy them in the first place (I'm in the latter category).
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;least make enough noise to make them notice us.  
</em><br />
<br />I think that while it would be nice to have Sonic back, it would also be 
<br />
nice to have new Tiny Toons too; given the current marketing/programming 
<br />
situation, I don't expect to see either again.  All we can do is keep the 
<br />
memories alive via the list, Usenet, and fan-fic, and/or move on to 
<br />
whatever replaces them (unfortunately, none of the replacements (for Sonic 
<br />
_or_ TTA) are nearly as good).
