<br />
Get comfortable fans of Mobius..this is a something of a lengthy but
<br />
worthwhile post. :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What is the actual scientific porcess for (sp?)robotazation?
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Debatable.  Some seem to favor a nanite-based technology while I prefer
</em><br />
to think of it in terms of a biomechanical synthesis.  And if I have to
<br />
explain any of this further, you may be in over your head ;-).
<br />

<br />
I've been a subscriber to this list for quite sometime, and a very occasional
<br />
poster, and since I don't always have the time to read every message, I was
<br />
wondering if the following hypothesis was ever introduced and just slipped by
<br />
me in some quick scanning and deletions of unread mail. That said hypothesis
<br />
being thus: The scientific process for robotization being based upon neither
<br />
nanites or biomechanical synthesis, (unless I'm misinterpreting what is meant
<br />
by that) but upon *other dimension energy conversion*. Consider the following
<br />
facts that we know from the ABC show (which in my own humble opinion, seem to
<br />
offer the most logic that I would take it for the most part to be canon over
<br />
the comic for specific points, like UC operating a Chili dog stand. Yeesh.
<br />
&lt;G&gt;) : 1) We learned that Uncle Chuck was the inventor of the Robotisizor,
<br />
having invented it with the noble goal of using it to help Mobians live
<br />
longer. More than likely, this goal was something of a parallel to
<br />
&quot;cryogenics&quot; over here, wherin as people grow older and are more susceptable
<br />
to disease and frailty, (or even with younger people, infants, children etc
<br />
who are unfortunately afflicted) such frailty and disease could be &quot;frozen&quot;
<br />
by the conversion, until a cure could be found for such dibilitating ailments
<br />
wherein the subject would then be derobotisized and treated. A definate
<br />
improvement over such an idea as cryogenics since one isn't &quot;asleep&quot; all that
<br />
time. 
<br />

<br />
The problem though, as UC found, was the treatment took away the subject's
<br />
free will so that either the subject was either nothing more than a mindless
<br />
zombie (unknowing most probably that the &quot;test subjects&quot;,-most probably lab
<br />
animals of somesort, despite  the anthromorphic nature of most beings on
<br />
Mobius. The process would have to be tested on creatures with measurable
<br />
intelligence-were, as he later discovered from his own first hand experience,
<br />
awake and alert but just unable to interact), a &quot;vegetable&quot; of sorts where
<br />
the subject was for all measurable respects &quot;dead&quot;, or a different type of
<br />
mindless zombie yet one that like a person under hypnosis, would do any
<br />
instruction that was asked of him or her. As a scientist and compassionate
<br />
hedgehog who respects the mind, which is in effect, the *life* of any
<br />
sentient creature, to put any subject under such a treatment until a cure can
<br />
be found for whatever ailment they have, even for a short time, is an
<br />
abomination of an idea to UC and the project was either scrapped or tabled
<br />
indefinately until such bugs in the system could be fixed (I know this is all
<br />
common knoledge thus far, but there's a point to it which will follow in a
<br />
moment. Please bear with me). 
<br />

<br />
Now as to *how* Robotization works, that I believe comes from a critical clue
<br />
that we got from the episode &quot;The Void&quot;. Fact 1) We know that again, UC is a
<br />
scientist and a great inventor. He was the one that invented the power ring
<br />
generator for Sonic to use (and which *only* the blue blur can use. I have
<br />
developed a working theory on why this is as well, but I don't want to use
<br />
this to take *too* long, so I'll cut to the chase. Interested parties about
<br />
my musings may e-mail me directly). Now, the Powerstone which is what
<br />
actually creates the Power Rings, we know, is very similar in its energy
<br />
configuration to that of the Deep Power Stones which caused Robotnik's defeat
<br />
in &quot;The Doomsday Project&quot;. Therefore, for UC to have discovered how to adapt
<br />
this power source (which falls in again with my unsaid working theory there)
<br />
for use, and the fact that he created the Robotisizor, one could conclude
<br />
that UC is very knoledgable in the workings of wave field energy. Using this
<br />
conclusion, I have hypothesized thusly: 
<br />

<br />
1) We know that there are other dimensions than the one Mobius is in, like
<br />
the Void, that can be accessed via either science or sorcery. 2) Taking a
<br />
look at The Void, we saw that an unfortunate side effect from prolonged
<br />
exposure, upon subjecting a person from that unstudied dimension to another
<br />
dimension, his or her home dimension or another (King Acorn for ex:, who went
<br />
from The Void, back over to Mobius) was the transmutation of living matter
<br />
into perhaps an unliving state of matter, or perhaps a living state of
<br />
matter, but an unmobile one. (Being that we as well as Sonic and co, do not
<br />
know even the slightest bit about the workings of the Void, save that it can
<br />
be manipulated through magic, one could not really jump to the conclusion
<br />
that were Nagus and King Acorn's transmutation allowed to take place fully,
<br />
that their crystalline state would be a dead form of matter. After all, as it
<br />
is hypothisized that *silicon* based life forms could exist on other planets,
<br />
why not crystalline lifeforms from another dimension? Now, jumping right back
<br />
to that idea of silicon based life, seeing that exposure to another dimension
<br />
could in effect, &quot;infuse&quot; a subject with the energies inherit in that
<br />
dimension, a process that would only be noticeable, or perhaps just more
<br />
*quickly* noticable by passage *from* that dimension, why could not the same
<br />
be said for the process of the Robotisizor? 
<br />
What I believe happened, is that UC, in his studies of other wave field
<br />
energies that existed in other dimensions (through an again much longer
<br />
synopsis of how these events took place sequentially), saw that the energies
<br />
in shall we say Dimension R (for Robotization, natch) was able to transmute
<br />
all living matter into its silicon and metal equivilant (One could wager a
<br />
guess that perhaps silicon based life was the prominent or only life form
<br />
present in that dimension, if sentient life was present at all). After all,
<br />
matter, living or non, is simply *energy*, and as has been hypothesized by
<br />
Gene Roddenbery and others, if a way could be found to turn matter into
<br />
energy and back again (Transporter Technology) in Star Trek, then its
<br />
entirely plausible that from exposure to another dimension, the energy of
<br />
one's body could be infused for &quot;adaptation&quot;, and transmuted, so that the
<br />
body of the subject would be able to survive in any given medium. 
<br />
In The Void and Dimension R, this effect would not be redilly noticable as
<br />
infusion is enough of an adaptation since the energy of the dimension is all
<br />
about the subject. However, *remove* that subject from all that available
<br />
energy, (bringing Nagus and Acorn to Mobius) and what energy (perhaps both
<br />
the Void and Dimension R energies are *sentient* energies of some sort,) is
<br />
inherent in the subject, is either forced to quickly adapt to maintain its
<br />
survival by overwhelming and transmutating the living matter it has entered
<br />
(sort of like the Vaccum effect in nature. There was no Void energy in Nagus
<br />
and Acorn when they entered the dimension, so nature sought to &quot;fill&quot; that
<br />
vaccum) and/or it could be that as Nagus suppossed, (since even he knew very
<br />
little about The Void) in the Void only his magics kept the transformation in
<br />
check, and that outside of &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, even with his magic, that Void energy
<br />
was powerful enough to run amok and transform them, the Void energy going
<br />
from something of a symbiotic nature (since Naugus could control it in The
<br />
Void) to a parasitic nature on Mobius where it was too powerful for him. 
<br />

<br />
A very close movie parallel could be seen in either version of &quot;The Fly&quot;
<br />
wherin the scientist's DNA was simply &quot;written over&quot;. Recent examples in Star
<br />
Trek Voyager could be given as well when Tom Paris entered that place (which
<br />
perhaps could be seen as another dimension, after all, isn't subspace in a
<br />
sense?) beyond Warp 9.999etc and had *his* dna written over as well. 
<br />
Now, that covers my ideas on Robotization, but getting back to the point a
<br />
few paragraphs previous with Uncle Chuck and his scrapping the project since
<br />
it took away a subject's free will, there's one more important point to
<br />
hypothysize upon. If the subject's free will was taken away, to the point
<br />
that the subject would do anything asked of him/her, which is the only
<br />
logical conclusion, since that &quot;vegetable&quot; bit UC found out to be untrue as
<br />
he was the first one changed, then why is it that only Robotnik is able to
<br />
control those Robotisized? Simple (sort of). As we know, Robotnik &quot;stole&quot; the
<br />
plans for the Robotisizor. Beyond being in charge of the Military (Again, a
<br />
timeline has been set up through the pondering of myself and some friends,
<br />
that explains the connection this has with his being a scientist), we know
<br />
that Robotnik is a brilliant scientist and inventor. We know that he knew
<br />
about other dimensions as well, since he worked with Naugus in studying The
<br />
Void before Naugus decided to go through to see what was there firsthand.
<br />
Now, knowing a great deal about Robotics, and electronic pathways, ie:
<br />
artificial intelligence shown in his Swat Bots and other bots, then what I
<br />
believe he did was after studying the Robotisizor, all that he saw he had to
<br />
do was to develop a program which as the subject was robotisized, would
<br />
program one simple order into the subject's now electronic pathway laid
<br />
&quot;brain&quot;. That order being:, &quot;Obey only him and Snivley&quot;, (though *him* first
<br />
and foremost should Snively try a coup) Again, sort of like hypnotizing a
<br />
person and putting a &quot;conditioned reflex&quot; into them, one that they could not
<br />
resist no matter what. The rest of the orders as they came up, &quot;Freedom
<br />
Fighters are the enemy, No 1 Priority Hedgehog&quot; and such, would be a simple
<br />
matter to &quot;install&quot; since having told them to &quot;obey&quot; his every whim, all he
<br />
would have to do is broadcast his desire, ie: Attack FF on sight&quot; or whoever,
<br />
even if they were members of the subjects own family, and that conditioned
<br />
reflex would automatically kick in, storing that dictum for future
<br />
&quot;automatic&quot; use, thus making the subject helpless to his or her own actions,
<br />
and those non robotisized, unable to reach them. As the FF don't know how
<br />
this program works, they have no feasible way of reaching the minds of those
<br />
robotisized to stop them or help them. I know that Uncle Chuck is the
<br />
veritable &quot;hypothysis hole big enough to drive a mack truck through &lt;G&gt;&quot;,
<br />
&nbsp;being that he was able to overcome his &quot;programming&quot;, both losing his free
<br />
will, and the orders that Robotnik imposed upon him, but again, I have
<br />
reasoned that out logically as well. However, that explanation is a slightly
<br />
lengthy one, involving The powerstone, (since powerrings were used to restore
<br />
his memory, something which has only worked with UC since the FF have never
<br />
used this trick on any other poor robotisized soul) so as this explanation
<br />
has already gone on for a good length of time, I'll just leave the option
<br />
open that those who are interested can e-mail me, or, if enough parties are
<br />
interested, I'll post the explanation here. 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Does Nicole have a solid-hologram generated body, or is that fanfic?
</em><br />

<br />
Not fanfic; in several eps, Nicole has generated holo images.
<br />

<br />
Yes, but those have always been transparencies, and never of living things.
<br />
Well to be more precise, never of *life* size living things that could be
<br />
mistaken for &quot;real&quot; since she did project Sally and Bunnie being captured by
<br />
Naugus in the ep &quot;The Void&quot;. Not to dictate what is and isn't in Nicole's
<br />
ability to anyone who writes, but in my opinion, if it were, then wouldn't
<br />
she have used that trick by now on the Swat Bots to distract them, perhaps
<br />
disable them, and to interact with the FF before now? Nicole's solid-hologram
<br />
generated body, to my knoledge, was first used in fanfic by a Sonic writer by
<br />
the name of Prin Sal1 who used to be on America On Line, unless she first saw
<br />
that adaptation of Nicole from another writer and used it for her own
<br />
writings that I was unaware of. My own belief is that seeing the solid
<br />
hologram &quot;doctor&quot; on Star Trek Voyager, she incorporated that holo technology
<br />
into Nicole. After all, solid holos need magnetic wave field generators, and
<br />
I don't think that Nicole has any of those built into her either or again,
<br />
she would have told Sally about them by now for her practical usage.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; This next question dosnt have anything to do with my writing fanfic, Im
</em><br />
just
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; curious..
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;   Am I missing something from the plot line? I dont understand the point of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; having nothing but power plants and factories and no life on a planet.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Wheres the fun in haveing nothing but robot slaves? One possable answere is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that Robotnik is compleatly insain.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Somebody have an asnwere to this?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You hear about the power plants and factories because they're the
</em><br />
preferred targets for the freedom fighters to hit.  They don't go in for
<br />
frontal assaults, preferring a strategy of hit-and-run.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Alternative answer: you hear about the power plants and factories because
</em><br />
a) Robotnik relies on them to further his conquest of Mobius; b) the
<br />
pollution generated by same isn't doing Mobius any good.  As for
<br />
Robotnik's insanity -- let's just say that, like a lot of dictators, he
<br />
has trouble thinking things through.
<br />

<br />
Not to mention the fact that as it has been said, not all that much of Mobius
<br />
has been charted to our knoledge, for which all that tech which Robotnik is
<br />
building up, could be used to spread his dominion over the planet as was just
<br />
said above. Another feasible option is that as Robotnik does have the ability
<br />
for space travel it could be reasoned, as he has the tech to launch objects
<br />
into space or at the least low orbit (as we saw with the &quot;Sky Spy&quot; in season
<br />
one), then its conceivable that Robotnik has plans to go conquer other
<br />
habitable planets to add to his dominion, once his factories have created the
<br />
necessary amount of technology and machinery needed. Is anyone out there
<br />
knoledable with Superman canon and the stories of &quot;Warword&quot;? (Think Death
<br />
Star for a close parallel if you don't.) If you do, then you can see what I'm
<br />
driving at as a possibility. Or it could be that he *is* just plain crackers.
<br />
::shrug:: That's all for now! (This post has been brought to you by the
<br />
friends of Uncle Chuck, Rotor, Gadget Hackwrench (Rescue Rangers) and other
<br />
like minded furries who understand, enjoy and use long, convoluted 
<br />
explanations, or in the words of Foghorn Leghorn, &quot;Longheaded Gobbledegoop.&quot;
<br />
&lt;G&gt; (Say Mr Drazen and Castiglia (Dan and Paul), any chance of finding an
<br />
opening at Archie Comics for a person with all this imagination, love of
<br />
Mobius, and few places to put it? )
