IMPERIAL NETWORK MESSAGE
<br />
FROM: The Master (Hear and Obey)
<br />
TO: All Imperial Citizens
<br />

<br />
Twenty years ago, the government that once wisely ruled this fair land 
<br />
was overthrown by the ambitions of an evil man, Dr. Ivo Robotnik.  
<br />
Destroying almost all of the monarchy and subsuming the government into 
<br />
himself, he mercilessly oppressed the people and the land, his ultimate 
<br />
aim seemingly the destruction of the entirety of Mobius.  The only forces 
<br />
that would stand against him were small groups of resistance fighters, 
<br />
striking at his forces where he least expected it, smashing his cruel 
<br />
ambitions and ultimately defeating him in battle, ten years ago this day.
<br />

<br />
Yet that victory was not without its own cost; as the Freedom Fighters 
<br />
celebrated their victory, Robotnik's soldiers were finally able to locate 
<br />
their hidden base by tracking the emanations of a legendary stone used in 
<br />
the destruction of Doomsday.  The resultant battle was cruel and swift; 
<br />
in one stroke, the leader of the resistance, Sally Acorn, was slain, and 
<br />
its most powerful fighter, Sonic the Hedgehog, was lost, presumed also 
<br />
demised.  Without their strong leadership, the Freedom Fighters seemed 
<br />
doomed.
<br />

<br />
Yet in this time of triumph and terror, one man was able to seize the 
<br />
reins of power and guide Mobius back to peace and prosperity.  Though the 
<br />
records of this time were lost, it is known that the Master was able to 
<br />
take control of Robotnik's remaining legacy, amplify it through his own 
<br />
genius, and end the last of the evil doctor's abuses.  At last, after ten 
<br />
years of benevolent yet firm leadership, the air over Mobitropolis can be 
<br />
breathed once more, and the water runs fresh and clean.
<br />

<br />
It distresses our beloved leader, therefore, to learn that certain fringe
<br />
radicals, styling themselves after the heroic Freedom Fighters (now model
<br />
citizens of society), have taken it upon themselves to assault his works,
<br />
his holdings, and even his very person.  Decrying imaginary abuses, they
<br />
seek to destroy all that he has worked so hard to regain for you, his
<br />
loyal subjects.  Be alert!  The rebels could be anyway, under any guise,
<br />
and you may be the one to catch these dangerous criminals--
<br />

<br />
*fzzt*
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
*fzzt*
<br />

<br />
DO NOT BELIEVE THE SMOOTH LIES AND DANGEROUS PROMISES OF THE CREATURE 
<br />
THAT CONTROLS THIS LAND!  HE PROMISES FREEDOM WHEN HIS TROOPERS ROAM THE 
<br />
STREETS!  VILLAGES THAT DISOBEY HIM ARE BURNED TO THE GROUND, THE 
<br />
VILLAGES ROBOTICIZED!  HE ENSLAVES THE MINDS AND WILLS OF THOSE HE CANNOT 
<br />
CONTROL THROUGH BRUTE FORCE!  THROW OFF YOUR SHACKLES!  JOIN THE REBEL 
<br />
FIGHTERS!  GLORIFY THE *TRUE* LEGACY OF SONIC THE HEDGE--
<br />

<br />
*fzzt*
<br />

<br />
--and enjoy this glorious holiday, the tenth anniversary of the ascension 
<br />
of our glorious leader, the Master himself!  All hail the Master!

<br />
If you managed to slog through all of that (grin), I'm looking for people
<br />
who wanna do a Sonic: TNG RPG PBEM (enough acronyms for ya?) It's ten
<br />
years after Doomsday, and things are-- different.  Robotnik is gone, Sally
<br />
is gone, and the enigmatic figure who calls himself 'the Master' rules
<br />
Mobius.  Things are better than when Robotnik ruled, but better is not
<br />
good.  Citizens are oppressed by the Empire, sometimes subtly, sometimes
<br />
not so subtly.  Monitors and guards are everywhere, ensuring loyalty.  
<br />
Still, if someone wants to toe the line and stay within the system, life 
<br />
can be fair, and few are willing to risk helping a desperate band of 
<br />
criminals.  For those seeking to overthrow the Master and restore Mobius 
<br />
to its former glory, these are 'interesting' times...
<br />

<br />
Please email me if you're interested!  I think you'll enjoy the changes I 
<br />
have in store for Mobius...
