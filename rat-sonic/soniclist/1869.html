<br />

<br />
Timeline: That next morning.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Daybreak over Knothole was its usual glorious self, if not somewhat busier
<br />
than usual.  The multitude of rescued Mobitropolis refugees were basically
<br />
wandering around, trying to learn their new routines.  Order was something
<br />
that could be achieved later, and confusion shortly became the rule.
<br />

<br />
It had started, of course, with Sally's usual speech about what had
<br />
happened in the last 10 years, about how Way Past Cool the Freedom Fighters
<br />
were, etc etc.  The usual propaganda, Joseph mused, as he watched the
<br />
various parts of Knothole from deep within his control room, yet inspiring
<br />
in a way...
<br />

<br />
He went back to flipping through the selections he had available.  Every
<br />
sector of his fortress, and the surrounding lands around it, looked
<br />
relatively peaceful.  The occasional roboticized citizen would wander in,
<br />
look around, and walk back; either that, or someone would escort them
<br />
back...it had been learned that Joseph did not like uninvited guests
<br />
roaming around his property.  
<br />

<br />
However, it was relatively quiet around Knothole today, because everyone
<br />
was trying to readjust to their new surroundings.  So Joseph finally grew
<br />
bored with looking around, and began the day's work.  He would upload the
<br />
information he had taken out of Robotropolis the night before, and then
<br />
begin creating an antidote for the roboticization process...and then, he
<br />
could rest.  He walked over to the input port, and activated his dataspike.
<br />
He balled his left hand into a fist, bent it up toward the ceiling, 
<br />
and...clik.  Clik.  Clik.  Clik.
<br />

<br />
Nothing happened.  His arm looked like it did before.  Normally, the top of
<br />
his forearm would open up, and a 3&quot; long spike would pop out.  Then, he
<br />
would insert it into the port, and begin a direct interface with the
<br />
computer.  But all he got now was an error message and a metallic `clik'.
<br />

<br />
Obviously, something was wrong with him.  Perhaps the Emerald had somehow
<br />
overloaded his arm, and it had just fused shut.  That could be fixed rather
<br />
easily, so this didn't start to bother him...yet.  All he did was to go up
<br />
to the repair level, and started a full diagnostic on his body.
<br />

<br />
As he walked on to the pad, as he had done many times before, he realized
<br />
he felt odd as the plasma rings went up and down his form, doing a routine
<br />
circuitry check.  Normally, he'd feel nothing.  But today, it was a
<br />
tingle...that was slowly turning into a stinging...that forced him to shut
<br />
off the scan out of self-preservation!
<br />

<br />
He quickly reviewed the results of the scan, and suddenly realized what the
<br />
problem was.
<br />

<br />
^L
<br />

<br />
He was flesh again.
<br />

<br />
He pondered this for a moment.  This was not necessarily a `bad'
<br />
thing...this was merely a very strange, abnormal thing.  He had a basic
<br />
idea of what the `why', `what', `who', and `when' was; obviously, the use 
<br />
of the Amber Chaos Emerald figured into it somehow.  But the `how', the 
<br />
`how'...a freakish nanite failure?  Impossible; nanites can't make metal
<br />
flesh again, and his repair systems would have kicked in to stop it.
<br />
A late-forming side effect of the DNA mutation from the power ring?
<br />
Highly improbable; the nanites were able to neutralize the reaction
<br />
after the initial change.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So, hotshot,&quot; he muttered to himself, &quot;what's done it?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He hated to admit it, but the hated word `magic' seemed to be the `how'.
<br />

<br />
Joseph did not like the whole concept of magic.  It was like getting a
<br />
desired result without knowing -why- or -how- or -what- did it.  He did not
<br />
like just having blind faith in anything; his father had taught him that,
<br />
as his father taught him.  But this was the only (and he hated admitting
<br />
this) logical answer.
<br />

<br />
He sighed.  This situation was getting more annoying by the minute.
<br />
Maybe doing an internal diagnostic would help get his mind off of it.
<br />
He closed his eyes, and concentrated on reactivating as much of his former
<br />
abilities as possible...if there were any left.  But since he still had use
<br />
of his brain, that meant most of his android form's mental abilities would
<br />
be left...
<br />

<br />
He thought hard and unwaveringly about his task.  Normally, he could
<br />
activate all of his sensors and other powers in a nanosecond.  But
<br />
something had gone wrong due to the emerald.
<br />

<br />
He finally opened his eyes again.  It was hopeless.  He was 100% Mobian
<br />
hedgehog now, and there wasn't anything left inside of him to change
<br />
that--but outside...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Bahb,&quot; he said, &quot;prepare a brainscanning unit, to the following
<br />
specifications....&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Back in Robotropolis:
<br />

<br />
Packbell sat in the Control Center, overseeing the repairs of Robotropolis.
<br />
Snively's utter failure in running the city was obvious.  Only 25% of the
<br />
total possible SWATBot units were operational.  12% of the city had power.
<br />
Just over 35% of the Worker-Bots remained, and a good portion of it was on
<br />
fire.  Typical.
<br />

<br />
However, the repairs were going as well as could be expected.  He had
<br />
employed a large portion of the SWATBots with the Worker-Bots to increase
<br />
productivity, which was working out about as he'd predicted.  A few of the
<br />
refineries were going back online that afternoon, which would keep the city
<br />
operational while he worked on finding an alternative energy source.
<br />

<br />
For the time being, Packbell noted, the city would pretty much take care of
<br />
itself.  There was no need for him to sit and stare at it while it put
<br />
itself back together....so he could allot himself some leisure time. 
<br />
Turning away from the monitor screens, he smiled evilly at the thought he
<br />
had recently created.  He pushed the intercom button, paused for a moment,
<br />
and bellowed with all of his might into it!  &quot;SNIVELY!!!!!  GET IN HERE 
<br />
*NOW*!!!&quot;  He released the intercom button and laughed fiendishly, and
<br />
waited for the sound of Snively's footfalls rushing up the stairs.
<br />

<br />
Snively rushed up the stairs from the 3rd basement in the Command Center,
<br />
where Packbell had put his new room.  He knocked the filth and rubbish out
<br />
of the way as he clawed his way up the the lobby and rushed up the stairs.
<br />
He knew very well why Packbell was doing this, but if he wanted to live
<br />
another day, he would have to obey...
<br />

<br />
Packbell listened in silence as the short, large-nosed human desperately
<br />
threw himself up the stairs, probably taking some minor damage as he
<br />
climbed.  (Packbell didn't even begrudge Snively a stairrail...he had to
<br />
run up the stairs completely under his own power.)  After a few more
<br />
seconds, Snively burst in, falling at Packbell's feet.
<br />

<br />
Snively panted as he pushed out the words that Packbell forced him to say
<br />
every time he saw him.  &quot;*pant*...Hail *pant* Supreme Commander *wheeze*
<br />
Packbell, Total *gasp* and Omnipotent *cough* Ruler of Moebius *pant*,
<br />
Conqueror of *wheeze* Robotropolis, and my *gasp* Almighty Lord.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell kicked Snively out of his way.  &quot;Good boy, Snotley.&quot;  He stood up,
<br />
looking down on the cringing human.  &quot;Now, here is your task for the day. 
<br />
I want you to go back downstairs, and run to the other side of
<br />
Robotropolis.  There you will find a soda machine.&quot;  Packbell threw two
<br />
golden coins at Snivley, which hit him in the chest.  As he grabbed them,
<br />
Packbell continued to speak.  &quot;Purchase a can of Fizz, and open it.  Then,
<br />
run back here, and hand it to me.  If so much as one drop is missing from
<br />
it,&quot; he stated, smiling evilly at Snively, &quot;you die.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell snapped his fingers.  &quot;I want to see you back in...oh, let's make
<br />
it 5 minutes this time.  Now go!&quot;  Snively quickly rushed out of the 
<br />
room, running for his very life.
<br />

<br />
Packbell laughed, and sat back down.  He giggled as he started his internal
<br />
chronometer....
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph stood in his lab as Bahb put the finishing touches on the
<br />
brainscanner he had instructed it to make.  It was similar to the neural
<br />
transfer device, but merely made a backup of one's memories and preserved
<br />
them on a storage device.  It was ideal for this situation's delicate
<br />
position...he didn't know how much time he had.
<br />

<br />
It was a rather nodescript device.  Basically, a long pipe that was
<br />
connected to the computer ended in a plunger-shaped scanning device, that
<br />
fit around Joseph's head with room to spare.  When the device was
<br />
activated, a slowly scanning ring of energy would pass up and down his
<br />
skull, taking a 3-D scan of his brain and replicating its design into a
<br />
file.  It would capture any thoughts he had since he was born, was having
<br />
now, and could predict what he was going to think 10 seconds later.  
<br />

<br />
He sat down under the device and allowed it to surround his head.  He
<br />
started to clear his mind of any thoughts, and ordered the scan to begin
<br />
when his mental activity was at its ebb.  He focused--and for 5 seconds,
<br />
his entire existance was blinked out.
<br />

<br />
A minute later, the device lifted, and Joseph's mind was returned to
<br />
normal.  He stood back up, shook his head a bit to reorient himself with
<br />
reality, and walked over to the console.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Bahb, give me an ETC on the compliation of the brainscan.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bahb hummed for a moment, and then emitted, &quot;Estimated time of completion:
<br />
one solar cycle.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded.  &quot;Very well.  I am going to go check on the Emerald, and
<br />
then I shall go outside to interact with the populace.  Give me a status
<br />
report hourly.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Bahb beeped obiediantly, and set itself to its work.  After a moment of
<br />
silent contemplation of this development, Joseph opened the secret stepdisk
<br />
that led to the power core and rode down to examine it.
<br />

<br />
The sight of the emerald made Joseph feel better already, for some reason.
<br />
He had placed it where his old ship's power core had been, which he had
<br />
used to power the complex when he first arrived.  It glowed with a warm,
<br />
orangish light, and made him feel younger and stronger.  The room was
<br />
beginning to grow greenish energy crystal around the sides of it as well,
<br />
but only in a few isolated patches.  Either way, Joseph found the
<br />
development intriguing, and sought to encourage it...and perhaps, even
<br />
understand it.  
<br />

<br />
The annoyance toward the crystal could not be manifested here.  He simply
<br />
was too invigorated by its presence to be angry at it.  It was only an
<br />
inanimate object, after all...it couldn't hurt him...in fact, he rather
<br />
liked the glowing, warm emerald.  It radiated an almost maternal love and
<br />
happiness (perhaps an airborne antidepressant is created from its reaction
<br />
with the oxygen here, he mused) for all living things...  Occasionally, 
<br />
a swirl of a different color would be visible in it, but it would 
<br />
quickly fade back to its normal amber state.  
<br />

<br />
Joseph found the object beautiful.  He liked to look at it, feel its power,
<br />
and be near its warmth.  But he had a responcibility to check on his
<br />
various experiments on it; so he tore himself away from gazing on it, and
<br />
examined the readings that were taken of it instead.
<br />

<br />
The readings still made no sense to him.  He could detect all sorts of
<br />
radiation coming off of the emerald, yet still could not find any energy 
<br />
signatures that could tell him what the emerald was made out of.  On scans,
<br />
it showed the emerald as a black area, denoting an unknown substance.
<br />
But it gave off energy that could come from hydrogen up to element 534.
<br />
It contradicted itself.  According to most sciences, this object shouldn't
<br />
even exist in this universe...he decided he should probably give up on this
<br />
for the day.  Sighing as he walked away, he looked at the emerald one 
<br />
last time before he took the steppad back to the surface.   
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
He squinted somewhat as he stepped out of the Dome.  Normally, his optical
<br />
sensors would adjust within nanoseconds to the light change, but organics
<br />
took a bit more time.  He cursed them as he slowly adjusted to the photon
<br />
bombardment.
<br />

<br />
The Great Forest looked as it always did.  The trees were still there.  He
<br />
could hear the sounds of his creek in the distance, with the occasional
<br />
fish jumping out of the water.  It was `pretty' to most people, but it gave
<br />
Joseph a different sort of feeling.  All it was to him was a series of
<br />
subconscious distractions to keep people from getting too close to his
<br />
home.  But still, he enjoyed being around them.
<br />

<br />
He wandered to the creek, and sat down on a rock.  He gazed into the water
<br />
for a few moments, collecting his thoughts.  His life was spinning out of
<br />
control.  He had no family, no lover, no hope of escape.  From the moment
<br />
he set foot on this planet, it had started taking things from him.  His
<br />
ship.  A few droplets of blood, which must have wetted its thirst for more.
<br />
A clean conscience?  Good bye.  Even his last reminder of home, his own 
<br />
body, had been taken from him.  All because of this damn planet.  
<br />

<br />
But it was a good world, he mused.  There were nice people on it.  What was
<br />
happening here happened on his own world long ago; perhaps by helping it,
<br />
he'd help himself.  Besides, his was a black and cold culture...the
<br />
universe probably is better off without it.
<br />

<br />
He stood up.  Nay, he thought, it is gone 300 years now.  As the universe
<br />
has forgotten it, so shall I...they would have wanted it that way. 
<br />
&quot;Progress over the antiquated, and those that lead the march shall live
<br />
forever in the hearts, minds, and actions of the next generation.&quot;  His
<br />
grandfather had said that all those years ago when he had given the Empire
<br />
the power of roboticization.  And he knew now that his words applied here.
<br />
He needed to evolve.  He was a outdated model of a line that had gone out
<br />
of production.  He pounded his fist into the palm of his other hand.  
<br />
It was time to make the leap to the new model year!
<br />

<br />
He sat down again and thought.  He wanted to be able to return to his fox
<br />
form; might as well not reinvent the wheel.  But the form of the hedgehog
<br />
would come in handy, too.  He also wanted some of his old android abilities
<br />
back, and especially some sort of neural net.  And, of course, he wanted 
<br />
to be able to utilize the Chaos Emerald again.  But, how could he do all
<br />
three feasibly? 
<br />

<br />
He pondered for a few moments.  He would have to design a body that could
<br />
do some limited shapshifting, but with resistance to powerful gamma (and
<br />
above) radiation.  Also, he would have to patch in cybernetics with it that
<br />
could handle the shifting and adjust quickly.  It would be a challenge, but
<br />
he was sure he could figure out a way to pull it off...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The spacecraft glided silently over Robotropolis, cloaked to all known
<br />
scanning devices on Mobius.  It quietly landed on the appropriate pad in
<br />
the center of Robotropolis, making no noise or signal that it had arrived.
<br />
A small hole seemed to open in reality as a figure emerged from inside the
<br />
cloaked vessel.  As the figure walked away, the hole closed, making the
<br />
ship completely invisible again.
<br />

<br />
The tall, slim creature quietly walked up the stairs, ignoring the various
<br />
SWATBots that ordered him to halt.  They fired at him, but their lazers
<br />
refracted off of the figure's personal shield.  After a while, they ceased
<br />
fire, and made way for the commanding, yet silent, figure.
<br />

<br />
Upstairs, Snively had just arrived, and was cowering before Packbell.
<br />
The figure, wanting to observe what was going on, arrived at the open door 
<br />
and phase-cloaked.  While invisible and untouchable, he listened to the 
<br />
banter that went back and forth...
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well, Snively,&quot; Packbell exclaimed faux-happily, &quot;you've gotten me my can 
<br />
of Fizz!&quot;  He grinned in an unpleasant way.  &quot;*Thank* *you* -so- much.&quot;
<br />
He then snatched the can from the cringing underling's hand, and threw it
<br />
violently out the window.  Upon seeing Snively's shocked and horrified
<br />
reaction, he laughed.  Then, his expression and tone became infuriated.  
<br />
&quot;Now get out of my sight!&quot;  After Snively had run off for his life,
<br />
Packbell sat back in his chair and had a good laugh.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I see that you've inherited Ivo's sick sense of humor, tinkertoy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell sat up in his seat.  &quot;Who said that?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;It is not for you to know.  Tell me where Robotnik is.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell blinked, and looked around.  &quot;Where are you?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tell me where Robotnik is.  You have 30 seconds to comply.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell stood up.  &quot;I don't need to tell you anything.  I am the ruler--&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;20 seconds.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell became irate, and pushed the intercom button.  &quot;SWATBots!  Report 
<br />
to the Command Center *immediately*!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The voice grew increasingly more annoyed.  &quot;10 seconds, tinkertoy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
SWATBots streamed into the Command Center as Packbell began shouting at
<br />
them to find the voice.  The voice even whistled quietly so to assist them,
<br />
but they couldn't seem to get their hands on him.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Time's up, tinkertoy.  Where is Robotnik?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell cursed and angrily looked around for the voice.  &quot;Show yourself!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Very well.&quot;
<br />

<br />
In the center of the room, about 3 feet from Packbell, a humanoid figure
<br />
began to materialize.  It was about 6'4, about 190 pounds, and was vulpine.
<br />
He had reddish fur, with hints of orange in it.  His silver pupils glared 
<br />
at Packbell, and his silver canines glinted against his otherwise
<br />
natural-appearing teeth.  He was clad in a black trenchcoat that went down 
<br />
to his calves, and was wearing a uniform-like suit under it.  His black
<br />
boots went over his pants, and his white fingerless gloves gave him a
<br />
distrubing appearance.
<br />

<br />
&quot;I seek Robotnik.  You will tell me where to find him, or you will be
<br />
terminated.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell looked at the figure.  &quot;And why should I tell you anything?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure grabbed Packbell's throat at an unnatural speed, and began to
<br />
squeeze it tightly.  &quot;Because, tinkertoy, I said so.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The SWATBots tried to move to act, but collectively realized that movement
<br />
to assist Packbell would most likely result in his termination.  So they
<br />
simply stood at attention as the figure continued to speak.  &quot;If I didn't
<br />
have a liking for Robotnik,&quot; it said, &quot;I'd simply break you in half right
<br />
now, and use your entrails as materials for a selection of post-modernist
<br />
art.&quot;  He moved his face uncomfortably close to Packbell's.  &quot;So cut 
<br />
the attitude and tell me where he *is*.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell tried to squeak out an answer, but the figure had closed off his
<br />
windpipe.  Realizing this, the nameless one threw Packbell back into his
<br />
seat.  &quot;Tell me -NOW-!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell took a few breaths, reacclimating his lungs so to be able to
<br />
produce an answer.  &quot;Robotnik,&quot; he wheezed, &quot;is dead.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure looked temporarily surprised, but resumed his normal demeanor.
<br />
&quot;So, Ivo finally managed to get killed...  I told him his idiotic Doomsday
<br />
project was doomed to failure.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell looked at the figure confusedly.  &quot;You'd been communicating with
<br />
Ivo?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure resumed his cold stare at Packbell.  &quot;Yes...my people have an
<br />
interest in this world.  We would...well, would have liked to acquire 
<br />
it from Ivo.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;So I suppose you have possession of it now?&quot;
<br />
Packbell nodded, and started to speak, &quot;But...&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure raised his hand for silence.  &quot;Very well.  We will simply
<br />
continue the negotiations with you.  But first, we will require an updated
<br />
manifest of your possessions.  Would you happen to have the latest one 
<br />
available?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell nodded, thinking.  &quot;Give me 30 seconds to produce one.&quot;  He walked
<br />
over to the console, pushed a few buttons, and displayed a file on the main
<br />
viewer.  &quot;I had wondered what this was...&quot;
<br />

<br />
He rose his hand again for quiet, reading...  &quot;You've suffered some losses
<br />
recently, haven't you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell nodded, silently cursing the idiocy of Snively.  &quot;A minor
<br />
catasthophe occured when one of my underlings took control of the main city
<br />
while I was on a brief hiatus.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure mused.  &quot;Yes...was it the hedgehog again?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You know about Sonic?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure looked over at Packbell.  &quot;I'm beginning to despise that
<br />
accursed vandal as much as Ivo...did.&quot;  He muses.  &quot;Well, have you tried
<br />
using nanites to get rid of him?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tried making a robot version of his little girlfriend and have her kill
<br />
him?&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tried to use his ego against him?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tried it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Broke his will?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Unbreakable.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Killed some of his friends?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Several.  Hasn't phased him.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Kidnapping?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Many, many times.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure hmmed.  &quot;Well, you're on your own, then.&quot;  He looked back at the
<br />
monitor, and tsked.  &quot;My, my, my.  You've lost over 75% of your Worker-Bots
<br />
in the past 3 years.  This won't do at all.  This planet was already a
<br />
fixer-upper, and now most of its work force has escaped.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He looked back at Packbell.  &quot;I'm afraid Ivo's original price for
<br />
this world is just too high.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell blinked.  &quot;Price?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure looked surprised.  &quot;He never infor--oh yes, silly me.  He didn't
<br />
want the possibility of a Freedom Fighter finding out that he was going to
<br />
sell this planet to the highest bidder.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell stood there, his positronic brain temporarily locked up.  He could
<br />
not justify in his mind a reason to sell Mobius.  After all, it was Ivo's
<br />
home, right...?
<br />

<br />
&quot;And, naturally, this development is simply going to lower what we are
<br />
willing to give.  We were hoping to convert this planet into a colony
<br />
world...it will take a bit longer, now; we'll have to recapture the already
<br />
roboticized citizens, and polish off the rest.  But I assure you, you'll
<br />
still get a very nice package for this...&quot;  He smiled evilly.  &quot;very rustic
<br />
little world.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Packbell snapped out of his lockup, forming a plan.  &quot;Understood.  What are
<br />
your new terms?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure started to turn away.  &quot;I will have to update my people on this
<br />
development first.  I will return in about 2 of your Mobian weeks.  For
<br />
now, we will leave the promised...gift below with your SWATBots.&quot;
<br />

<br />
As he faded from view again, Packbell got to his feet.  &quot;Wait!  I don't
<br />
even know your name!&quot;
<br />

<br />
As he slipped back into the shadows, he whispered, &quot;Call me...John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that, he disappeared, leaving behind a confused and puzzled Packbell.
<br />
After a few moments of processing this new influx of data, he pushed the
<br />
intercom button.  &quot;SWATBot Squad 34-G: retrive the crate left by our
<br />
visitors, and bring it to me.&quot;  A compliant beep was heard, and then the
<br />
intercom automatically shut off.
<br />

<br />
The SWATBot squad went down to the pad, where a small crate was being set
<br />
out by some lowly-looking red foxes.  They scurried back inside the
<br />
light-hole, and disappeared.  A few moments after that, a dim hum was
<br />
heard, and something seemed to leave the area.  A hole was poked in the
<br />
clouds, allowing the outline of the saucer-shaped craft to be seen before
<br />
it faded into space.
<br />

<br />
The SWATBots didn't really notice that as they carefully picked up the
<br />
crate and walked into the freight elevator.  SWATBots are not creative
<br />
machines; they are rather dull, and aren't great conversationalists.
<br />
They merely follow orders.
<br />

<br />
The platoon of SWATBots arrived inside the Command Center, and placed the
<br />
box by Commander Packbell.  They stepped away from it, saluted, and walked
<br />
back to their posts.  Packbell waited for them to leave before opening the
<br />
box.  He carefully popped the top off of it, and pulled off the nearest side.
<br />
A wave of packing material fell at his feet as he removed the object from the
<br />
crate...
<br />

<br />
It was a long object, about the length of a baseball bat.  There was a hole
<br />
on one side, and a power cell attached to the other.  It had a button
<br />
on the top by an aiming sight, and an shoulder rest.  A few extra power
<br />
cells were attached to it by some shrinkwrap, with a note.  Packbell put
<br />
the device down for a moment, and opened up the note; which read:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Ivo: This is the latest revision of our basic plasma cannon.  We've
<br />
altered the power cells so they can be charged by your power stations.
<br />
The usual schematic is inside the shrinkwrap.  Enjoy!  -- T.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell smiled.  So this is how Ivo kept `developing' the new technologies
<br />
they had been utilizing!  He sat down in the chair, and begin to analyze
<br />
the new device...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The day had passed uneventfully at Knothole.  The initial chaos of having
<br />
an influx of new villagers had been taken care of, and everyone had settled
<br />
in well.  Everyone had gotten their work assignments, which really began to
<br />
fly by...the day's work usually would end at noon, thanks to the
<br />
introduction of new technologies and the muscle power of the roboticized
<br />
citizens.  So the rest of the day had been a needed relaxation period for
<br />
most people, while Sally and the rest of the military section of the
<br />
Freedom Fighters planned their next raid.
<br />

<br />
But, deep inside Joseph's lab, the events of the surface were of little
<br />
concern.  He had spent most of the day running simulations...and he had
<br />
figured out the exact DNA he would need in order to create something to his
<br />
specifications; a mixture of Keldy'rian, Ur'thaen, Mobian, and a bit he had
<br />
strung together himself would be the matrix for his new shell.  The
<br />
Keldy'rian would be the conduit for the Ur'thaen and Mobian DNA, and would
<br />
hold all three together while only allowing one to manifest at a time.  In
<br />
a nutshell, it would give him the ability to appear to be either a normal
<br />
Ur'thaen orange fox, or a normal Mobian orange hedgehog, while being able
<br />
to switch to one or the other freely.  The extra bits of DNA he had added
<br />
would give his new body the ability to withstand extremely high radiation
<br />
for unlimited amounts of time, and be sure that his body would not reject
<br />
the cybernetics he was going to add.
<br />

<br />
He was especially proud of the way he was going to be able to maintain his
<br />
intelligence within the form.  If he was home on Ur'thae, this would have
<br />
gotten him the same level of accolades that his father had recieved for the
<br />
neural transfer device; he had perfected a mimetic polyalloy.  
<br />

<br />
His people had tried for decades to perfect one that would maintain
<br />
molecular consistancy yet be able to remember programming and instructions.
<br />
But all of them had failed for one reason or another...but not this one.
<br />
Not only would it be able to remember and maintain his own personality
<br />
matrix, but it would maintain the knowledge he had already acquired *and*
<br />
was able to hold an unlimited amount of additional data.  It would be the
<br />
perfect central nervous system; all he would have to do is to inject it
<br />
into the new form (after the brain and nervous systems had been removed)
<br />
and it would take over.  
<br />

<br />
At last, he would have the ideal, nearly perfect body he had always wanted.
<br />
Free of the worries of brain or other physical death, yet still organic.
<br />
Enhanced sensor sensitivity, fast nervous system, highly resistant to
<br />
outside influence, genetically compatable with most other species...and,
<br />
with the addition of nanites, almost instant healing and a nearly 
<br />
invincible immune system.  It was a form that could last for as long as he
<br />
wanted it to.
<br />

<br />
After doing some final bits of tweaking, he began the creation process...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
But up on the surface, a mission was being planned.  The usual suspects,
<br />
Sally, Sonic, Rotor, Antoine, Dulcy, Charles, Bunnie, and Tails were standing 
<br />
around an updated aerial view of Robotropolis, figuring out the 
<br />
Worker-Bot details for that night.  Tails was mostly in the background,
<br />
tho, listening.
<br />

<br />
&quot;...and that's how we're going to do that.  Remember, Snively probably
<br />
realizes that we'll strike here, so it's going to be a hard fight.
<br />
Therefore, it's a fair bet that there'll be lots of SWATBots around,
<br />
guarding the Worker-Bots.  That's why only Sonic will actually go in to get
<br />
the group of citizens, while Dulcy, Antoine and Bunnie will assist people in
<br />
escaping.  I will lead a diversion with Charles and Rotor that will strike
<br />
on the opposite side of Robotropolis, forcing Snively to spread out a few
<br />
platoons of SWATBots at us.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
She paused, looking for questions.  Finding none, she deactivated the
<br />
hologram.  &quot;We will leave for Robotropolis at the usual time.  Dulcy will
<br />
drop Charles, Rotor, and myself off first.  Five minutes after she has
<br />
returned here, Bunnie and Antoine will leave for Robotropolis, with Sonic
<br />
having an approximate head start of 10 seconds.&quot;  She smiled.  &quot;Dismissed.&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
An hour or two later, thanks to the science of age-acceleration, Joseph's 
<br />
body had completed being grown.  The mimetic polyalloy had been injected 
<br />
without incident to take over the nervous system, and it had created a 
<br />
datajack in the center of the back of its neck to permit Joseph to upload 
<br />
himself into it.  Everything had gone according to plan.
<br />

<br />
Now, Joseph waited for Bahb to complete processing the collected
<br />
information of his life he had given it that morning.  It was just about
<br />
completed; Bahb had sped up the process considerably, thanks to the long
<br />
periods of zero input he had endured.  In another five minutes, it would be
<br />
completed.
<br />

<br />
He drank his coffee and admired his old form one last time.  He tapped it
<br />
somewhat, smiled, and laid down on the guerney.  It pulled itself over
<br />
underneath the intelligence transfer unit, next to his new form.  The
<br />
device went down over both of their craniums, and activa--
<br />

<br />
Reality stopped.
<br />

<br />
^L
<br />

<br />
Reality started.
<br />

<br />
Joseph opened his eyes in his new form as the old one was derezzed.  The
<br />
device lifted away from his face, and he hopped off the guerney.  He
<br />
noticed that he was already back in his normal vulpine form.  Success!
<br />
He walked over to the mirror, which confirmed his suspicions.
<br />

<br />
He was a normal, breathing flesh-and-blood fox again!
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he tested out his mimetic polyalloy brain.  He pulled up his
<br />
heads-up display faster than he ever had before.  He scanned the room in
<br />
every spectrum of electromagnetic radiation he could surmise.  Perfect!
<br />
He did an internal diagnostic.  Everything was at 100% -or- -greater-!
<br />
He was better off than he was before!  He did some backflips to celebrate,
<br />
and to test the agility of his new body.  Perfectperfectperfect!
<br />

<br />
But there was one final test.  He closed his eyes, and thought of becoming
<br />
a hedgehog....he was overtaken by a sense of vertigo....he opened his
<br />
eyes...and was a hedgehog.  Yes!  This RULED.  He closed his eyes, and
<br />
thought of becoming a fox again...the vertigo...and then he was.
<br />

<br />
He was so proud of himself.  He'd finally done something worthwhile with
<br />
his abilities...then he remembered.  The files he had gotten from
<br />
Robotropolis!  Were they still there?!  He closed his eyes and searched...
<br />

<br />
[NO INFORMATION AVAILABLE]
<br />

<br />
Joseph cursed.  He must have lost them during the transfer.  He'd have to
<br />
go back and get them again...of course, he couldn't just go out and
<br />
steal them like he did last time.  That was an extremely lucky break.
<br />
No, he would have to think of a new way of going about getting what he
<br />
needed...his super-strength, for example, was no longer present.
<br />
He'd have to find a way to deal with that.  Of course, he'd have to explain
<br />
to the others how he had returned to his `natural' state, and find a way of
<br />
getting to and from Robotropolis as quickly as possible.  He certainly
<br />
didn't want to mooch a ride off that dragon.  Too unreliable.  He'd have to
<br />
get around to building some sort of transportation one of these days.
<br />

<br />
But that would wait until later.  Right now, he'd be content with simply
<br />
shifting into his hedgehog state, running to the edge of Robotropolis, and
<br />
allowing the Freedom Fighters to distract Snively while he stole as much
<br />
data as possible.  Then, he'd run back home, and return to normal as Bahb
<br />
processed it.  He'd extrapolate the needed data, and have Bahb rig up
<br />
deroboticizer software.  Then, he'd build the necessary device, and finally
<br />
begin repairing his father's mistake once and for all...in an orderly
<br />
fashion, to boot.
<br />

<br />
For now, he'd bide his time until nightfall, enjoying being a fox again,
<br />
and perhaps he'd work in a brief martial arts practice period before he
<br />
left...so much to do, so little time!
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Night fell on the surface, and the majority of Knothole turned in for the
<br />
evening's rest.  Only a few denziens of Knothole, the ones going on the
<br />
actual mission stayed awake.
<br />

<br />
Dulcy airlifed Sally, Charles, and Rotor to Robotropolis, where they were
<br />
planning on sabotaging a chip manufacturing facility.  Upon her return,
<br />
Bunnie and Antoine were taken to the other side of Robotropolis, where a
<br />
large group of Worker-Bots were working under heavy guard on repairing a
<br />
SWATBot production plant.  Sonic shot after them, and hid in the shadows
<br />
until the diversion started.
<br />

<br />
A minute or two later, Joseph came out of the Dome, ready to do an assult
<br />
on Robotropolis as well.  He had his personal shield unit fully charged,
<br />
had a small phaser attached to his side, and was at 100% efficiency.
<br />
He took a path that would lead him into the center of Robotropolis with as
<br />
little difficulty as could be expected.  He'd have to dodge the occasional
<br />
squad of SWATBots (and who knows what else), but he figured he could always
<br />
teleport out if it got too hot.  He hoped.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Sonic arrived at Robotropolis a minute before Dulcy did.  He paused to
<br />
examine his current target, a refinary.  SWATBots were assisting the
<br />
Worker-Bots this time...guarding and working at the same time.  Clever, the
<br />
hedgehog thought, but not Way Past Cool.  He plotted a course of attack,
<br />
figuring in the large amount of SWATBot fire that was bound to occur.  It
<br />
appeared everything was going to go as expected...yet, something seemed 
<br />
amiss to the hedgehog.  It was unlike Snively to use his SWATBots for actual
<br />
`work'...just Freedom Fighter-shooting and patrolling.  This stunk of
<br />
something fishy.  Big Time.  
<br />

<br />
He heard Dulcy land in the distance, far enough away so not to be spotted
<br />
by 'Bot planes when leaving Robotropolis.  Now, all they had to do was wait
<br />
for the--
<br />

<br />
An explosion in the distance lit the sky as alarms started to sound.  Sally
<br />
had set off the charges around the SWATBot production plant, slowing the
<br />
further regeneration of Snively's troops.  That'd get him steamed for sure.
<br />
He listened for the usual screechy howling from the loudspeakers, cursing
<br />
for all available SWATBots to destroy `that hedgehog', no matter who
<br />
actually -did- it.  Bulbhead was pretty low-watt.
<br />

<br />
But not a voice was to be heard.  Yet, the SWATBots put down what they were
<br />
doing, climbed into 'Bot planes, and flew off toward the explosion.  Sonic
<br />
was puzzled for a moment, and then remembered that SWATBots could take
<br />
orders by certain radio frequencies, too; encrypted, of course.  But
<br />
Snively had never thought of that before...maybe he was finally starting to
<br />
catch on about this `badnik' business.  Nah.
<br />

<br />
He waited for the majority of them to leave before readying himself for the
<br />
attack.  It appeared that about a squad was left, something Sonic would
<br />
normally be able to take care of in an instant....it still didn't feel
<br />
right.  It was as if a 6th sense had noticed something deeper than his keen
<br />
hedgehog eyesight couldn't detect.
<br />

<br />
He was wasting precious time with this wimpyness, he thought.  What am I,
<br />
Ant?  He scoffed at that, imagining how panicky Ant would be in a situation
<br />
like this.  That's why he was always left in someone else's care, noted
<br />
Sonic, and started into a run--
<br />

<br />
A glitter of 'Bot metal from around a corner.  That's all Sonic needed 
<br />
to see.  Now he knew this was an ambush; his delay had allowed him to see
<br />
what was coming.  Past Cool!  Wait.  Way Uncool.  Now he'd have to either
<br />
turn back now, warn Dulcy and risk hanging around here without doing
<br />
anything until Sally ordered the evac; or fight through a few squads of
<br />
SWATBots and risk being captured, killed, or roboticized.  Hmmmm...
<br />

<br />
Discretion is the better part of valor, it is said.  If that is so, Sonic
<br />
was slightly worse off than Antoine in that department.  He took out a
<br />
power ring, took out his free-will inducing pistol, and blasted off into
<br />
the now-expected `ambush'.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Joseph approached the front gates into Robotropolis, his cloak active.
<br />
He stealthily approached the main door, listening for activity.  Only a few
<br />
SWATBots were around now...the Freedom Fighters had probably distracted the
<br />
rest of them.  But, of course, this was to his advantage.
<br />

<br />
He snuck inside the gates with no incident.  Walking quietly by some
<br />
SWATBots, who were barely even paying attention to anything behind them, he
<br />
wandered closer into the heart of Robotropolis.  Some repairs had been
<br />
completed since last night; a few buildings had tarps on them to keep the
<br />
outdoors out, while a few piles of garbage had been tended to.  This was
<br />
odd to Joseph; Snively would not normally take such care of Robotropolis.  
<br />
Then, he detected the familiar sounds of distant explosions and lazer fire 
<br />
echoing in the distance.  Joseph listened carefully to them, and concluded
<br />
they would not become a threat.  At least, it was improbable that they
<br />
would.  He hurried up somewhat, not wanting to tempt fate.  
<br />

<br />
Joseph approached the Command Center, and was mildly surprised.  The
<br />
Command Center was actually -guarded- today with SWATBots.  Finally, he
<br />
thought, Snively had got on the ball.  You can't just leave a fortress, no
<br />
matter how formitable, unguarded.  Roughly two squads guarded the main
<br />
entrance, while 3 or 4 were watching over the minor entrances.  This would
<br />
actually be an enjoyable challenge to infiltrate, Joseph mused, and walked
<br />
closer to the main entrance.
<br />

<br />
The SWATBots took little notice of the cloaked figure before them...they
<br />
didn't have the amount of imagination required to put together that the
<br />
occasional disturbance around 3 feet above ground level was not caused by
<br />
some sort of fumes, nor were they merely the product of a heat-producing
<br />
device underground.  They merely ignored it, and kept scanning the horizon
<br />
for threats they could comprehend.
<br />

<br />
Joseph crouched on the ground, looking for an opening.  He kept waiting for
<br />
a SWATBot to move, or for something to occur near enough to them to trigger
<br />
some sort of response.  Nothing.  He stared at the SWATBots.  The SWATBots
<br />
looked out over him.  He waited.  They didn't move.  Finally, he sat down
<br />
and thought for a little while.  What would cause me to panic, if *I* was a
<br />
SWATBot...having an idea, he rushed off back into Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
A few minutes went by.  The SWATBots still stood there, emotionlessly
<br />
waiting for a stimulus to respond to.  Then, a low hum was heard in the
<br />
distance.  The SWATBots sent queries among themselves, trying to determine
<br />
the cause of the noise.  It drew nearer.  The SWATBots armed their
<br />
wrist-blasters and waited.  Then, it went further away.  Automatically, the
<br />
SWATBots went back on standby.  A few more minutes went by.  The hum
<br />
returned, and then left.  This was starting to make even the most
<br />
uncreative SWATBot among them suspicious, and a few of them broke rank to
<br />
investigate.  The hum remanifested after the SWATBots would have gotten
<br />
close enough to hear it...but suddenly, the sounds of SWATBots getting
<br />
fried were the precursors to a very fast, rocket-powered red blur racing 
<br />
past the Control Center.  The SWATBots immediately started to pursue the
<br />
blur, and called for backup.  
<br />

<br />
After most of them had left, Joseph walked out from behind some
<br />
semi-demolished architecture, and wandered into the more invasion-friendly
<br />
Control Center.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph was yet again greeted by the odd semi-cleanliness of Robotropolis.
<br />
This was beginning to get ridiculous, he mused.  Snively is definitely not
<br />
behind this; but if not Snively, who?
<br />

<br />
He went over to the stairwell, only to stop short of opening it: an alarm
<br />
was attached to a low-powered lazer, which had set up a bounce-pattern
<br />
around the door that made entering by that method impossible.  Whoever was
<br />
behind this had a knowledge of security that was beyond Snively's...so how
<br />
would he continue to ascend into the Control Center into the central
<br />
computer core?  He pondered, and then flattened himself against a wall as a
<br />
group of SWATBots walked over to a wall.  The head SWATBot sent a small
<br />
blink of red light into a panel, opening an freight elevator up.  Before it
<br />
could close behind them, Joseph poured on a little hedgehog speed and
<br />
zipped into the elevator.
<br />

<br />
The wall shut in front of the elevator, and it started to ascend...
<br />

<br />
Joseph stood in the midst of 4 SWATBots, all of them oblivious to his
<br />
presence and busy communicating amongst themselves in a sort of robotic
<br />
gossip.  Joseph listened in to the conversation, which was mainly a dull
<br />
discussion of the new policies that would be implemented in Robotropolis
<br />
as of such and such, blah blah blah.  He caught snippets of the important
<br />
stuff, tho...a more agressive search for Knothole, a continuation of
<br />
roboticization of captured citizens, rather than termination for offenses
<br />
against...`Packbell'?
<br />

<br />
Joseph had heard the name in the occasional conversations he'd
<br />
`unintentionally' listen in on.  Apparently, `Commander' Packbell was an
<br />
android like he used to be, but with a (and this had made him chuckle)
<br />
-positronic- brain.  He almost giggled in the elevator when he thought
<br />
about it...he'd built a positronic brain when he was a child.  It was his
<br />
final exam for his admission into what would be `4th' grade on Mobius.
<br />
They were comically inefficient, they locked up when chaotic situations
<br />
(like the majority of situations in life) occurred, they learned
<br />
slowly...all they were good for was memorizing things and applying what
<br />
they learned to certain tasks.  But their thought patterns ran to practical
<br />
means.  You could stun one with a good, hard riddle, and pretty much fry
<br />
one by leaving it in the presence of a few kits.  But a few of the more
<br />
`advanced' (ha-ha) ones had simple emotions...it was very possible that
<br />
Packbell had somehow returned from whereever he had been hiding for all
<br />
these months, and taken back over Robotropolis.  It would explain the
<br />
strange and semi-intelligent security measures that had recently taken
<br />
place.
<br />

<br />
The door opened, and the SWATBots (and Joseph) left the elevator.  They
<br />
were on a lower level than Joseph would have wanted, but hitchhiking never
<br />
got one hand-delivered anywhere.  So, he looked around, and tried to figure
<br />
out what he could usefully do from this area.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
It was a basic sub-level of any good fortress.  It was a SWATBot storage
<br />
area, and had some basic supplies present in it.  No windows, but dim
<br />
lighting that was just enough so SWATBots could manuver their way around
<br />
inside.  However, they did Joseph's regular vision no good.  He switched to
<br />
I/R, which was usually easier to utilize.
<br />

<br />
Ahh, here we go.  He was standing at the end of a corridor that stretched
<br />
down around the curvature of the building.  A few sliding doors were on the
<br />
side, for quick SWATBot dispersal.  The floor was solid, but there was a
<br />
grate in the ceiling that might lead higher up into the complex.  He'd have
<br />
to investigate that soon enough.  However, he might as well explore around
<br />
in here while he had the chance to at a leisurely pace.  After all, he
<br />
had--he checked his internal power gauges--about 2 hours left of full cloak
<br />
before he'd have to start heading home...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, back on the surface:
<br />

<br />
Sonic had dispatched the majority of the SWATBots that were at the complex,
<br />
due to the fact that they had anticipated on having the element of
<br />
surprise.  He'd gotten a few Worker-Bots conscious and out, but he found
<br />
that few others were about.  But, he had gotten some of them out, so the
<br />
mission wasn't a total failure.
<br />

<br />
However, the SWATBots seemed to be crawling out of the walls...the more of
<br />
them he was able to destroy, the more that seemed to appear.  They had
<br />
also scored a few nicks on him; mainly in the back, ironically enough.
<br />
But the outcome of the battle was still uncertain.  They wouldn't get
<br />
Chuck, Bunnie, Ant, Sal, Rotor or Dulcy...they had escaped with the platoon of
<br />
Worker-Bots he'd sent out with them.  At least they'd thought of that.
<br />
But he had one last hope; his power ring.  The only thing was, they'd never
<br />
back off enough to let him take it out, concentrate, and then juice.  They
<br />
kept coming, so he'd have to keep spin-dashing through them.  And he was
<br />
getting tired.  Way Past Uncool.  Unless he kept moving, they'd grab him,
<br />
and then it'd be Game Over...but, just when all appeared lost, and Sonic 
<br />
was about to pass out from exhaustion, a great roar was heard drawing
<br />
near... 
<br />

<br />
To the amazement of Sonic and the SWATBots assaulting him, Robotnik's old
<br />
hovercraft, albeit worse for wear, was the source of the fire!
<br />

<br />
It swooped out of the sky, cannons blazing, and started strafing the
<br />
SWATBot platoons.  'Bot after 'Bot fell to its rampage, most retreating
<br />
after the first pass.  With flames licking out from beneath it, it scooped
<br />
the hedgehog and roared back into the sky.
<br />

<br />
After a moment of adjusting to the shock, Sonic looked up from the floor of
<br />
the hovercraft and saw a hazy image of an orange hedgehog.  &quot;Huh?&quot; he
<br />
grunted, trying to grab onto something solid.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hello, Sonic,&quot; the image said, &quot;and no, I'm not really Joseph.  I'm a 
<br />
holographic image of Joseph, programmed with a limited amount of his
<br />
knowledge.  He quickly assembled me as a diversion, but since I saw you in
<br />
a spot of trouble, I decided to assist you as well.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic was still reassembling his senses.  Then, a chili dog and a Fizz [tm]
<br />
soda appeared before him.  &quot;Please, consume this food,&quot; the image said, &quot;it
<br />
will help your body recover its needed nutrients.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He quickly bolted down the food, and reacquired his basic personality
<br />
matrix.  &quot;Whoa,&quot; he amazedly said, realizing exactly what was going on,
<br />
&quot;Joe put you together as just a -diversion-?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure nodded as the craft roared faster around Robotropolis.  &quot;He
<br />
required an intelligence to fly the craft around to distract SWATBots. 
<br />
There were too many around the Command Center for him to elude.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic blinked.  &quot;Allow me to explain,&quot; the image said, and filled Sonic in
<br />
on the finer details of what had occurred within the last 48 hours.
<br />

<br />
&quot;So that's why he keeps tagging along,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;he wants to get the
<br />
info right from the source!  And our missions were the perfect diversions
<br />
for him.  Way Past Smart!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The image smiled as the craft dodged some incoming lazer fire.  &quot;He'd thank
<br />
you for that...but now I must complete my function.&quot;  He flickered for a
<br />
moment.  &quot;You might wish to hold on to something, hedgehog,&quot; the image
<br />
twittered, &quot;because it's going to get very bumpy in a moment.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic nodded and strapped himself in.  &quot;Hold on,&quot; the computer said, and
<br />
set the craft into a 3G turn...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph navigated the halls for a while, but then realized there was nothing
<br />
of value to him inside here.  Not a solitary dataport was on this level;
<br />
he'd have to go up further into the complex to find such a device.  So, he
<br />
wandered back to where he started, opened up the grate, and climbed inside.
<br />

<br />
He crawled around inside the grates for a while, listening for the familiar
<br />
sounds of humming computers.  He climbed up a few 75 degree planes, jumped
<br />
up into a sheer ventcliff, and finally seemed to get close enough to the
<br />
computer room to hear it...
<br />

<br />
Looking through the grate, he saw the familiar R&amp;D room.  However, it was
<br />
guarded by a few SWATBots this time, so it would be unwise to merely bust
<br />
through the grate.  No, a more subtle method would need to be used...so, he
<br />
chose to crawl further down the line, outside the R&amp;D room itself.
<br />

<br />
He looked out this grate, and noticed guards outside the R&amp;D room itself as
<br />
well.  Packbell was certainly paranoid, wasn't he?  He mused for a moment.
<br />
How could he get rid of both guards without alerting anyone else of it?
<br />
His phaser certainly wouldn't be quiet enough, and smashing them would be
<br />
even worse.  He leaned against the wall and thought harder...and had an
<br />
idea.  An insane, completely stupid idea, but one that just might work.
<br />
He remembered how Sonic had told him once that he was able to free Sally
<br />
from a cell by impersonating Robotnik to a computer.  So if Sonic could do
<br />
it with a cup, Joseph could certainly do it with his precision mimicry
<br />
programming.  He concentrated on the sound of Robotnik's voice...adjusted
<br />
his vocal chords accordingly...and then announced out the grate:
<br />

<br />
&quot;Attention all SWATBots!  Report to the lobby IMMEDIATELY!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He looked out the grate, and waited for the incoming fire.  But that didn't
<br />
happen...appearently, SWATBots must be programmed to obey Robotnik's voice;
<br />
because not only the ones in front of the door rushed off to the elevator,
<br />
but the ones inside pursued them!  Joseph was oddly surprised, but he was 
<br />
never one to look a gift horse in the mouth--he kicked out the grate 
<br />
and rushed inside the R&amp;D room.  As his vocal chords returned to normal, 
<br />
he popped out his dataspike and quickly did the 2-second download of 
<br />
all of Robotropolis' information.
<br />

<br />
This, of course, set off every alarm in the entire complex.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Packbell had been busy ordering about SWATBot squads and 'Bot planes when
<br />
the main alarm system finally went off.
<br />

<br />
&lt;&lt; RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  SECURITY BREACH IN SECTOR 2-ALPHA! &gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
He immediately sprung out of his seat, ordered all SWATBots to continue
<br />
their respecitive pursuits, and grabbed his plasma cannon from off a table.
<br />
After he had armed it properly, he burst out the door and ran down the
<br />
hall, in an especially bad mood.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph emerged from the R&amp;D lab rapidly, also in a angry mood.  He
<br />
shouldn't have been in such a hurry.  Now he'd really have a problem
<br />
escaping from here with all his quills attached.  He looked down the hall,
<br />
and saw a humanoid figure toting...
<br />

<br />
He increased magnification and enhanced the image.  He scanned it twice to
<br />
be sure, but it was.  He dared not say it, for he did not wish to reveal
<br />
any information inadvertantly to this individual (besides, he was still
<br />
cloaked).  But he knew he could not leave without it.  But how could he get
<br />
it from him, and yet not risk staying here to fight him?
<br />

<br />
As he got closer, he tried to scramble behind a wall, but bumped into
<br />
something going the opposite way and stumbled forward.  His forward
<br />
momentum caused his foot to stick out from the corner of the wall, directly
<br />
within Packbell's path.  As Packbell drew closer to the corner, he tripped
<br />
over the hedgehog's foot and fell forward, dropping the gun from the shock.
<br />
The gun spun across the floor to the foot of an open elevator, which then
<br />
lodged itself between the inside of the elevator and the hallway; holding
<br />
the door open.
<br />

<br />
Several things happened very fast after that.
<br />

<br />
Joseph, not wanting to miss an opportunity, scrambled over Packbell
<br />
(leaving an imprint in his face from his boot) and shot into the open
<br />
elevator.  The thing he had bumped into happened to be a SWATBot, which
<br />
shot in the direction of the motion.  Joseph spun, grabbed the gun from the
<br />
door, and slipped to the side--as the door closed, deflecting the blast.
<br />
Quickly, he toggled the down button, leaving the floored Packbell alone to
<br />
pummel the SWATBot in anger.  
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
As the door opened at the lobby, Joseph was immediately besieged by SWATBot
<br />
fire.  (Perhaps it was a mistake to send them down there after all.)  He
<br />
blasted a few of them, but mostly fired wildly as he used his innate
<br />
hedgehog speed to race his way out of the complex, leaving a blue-hot trail
<br />
of plasma behind him.  
<br />

<br />
As he raced toward the exit of the city, trying madly to evade the
<br />
entourage of 'Bot planes he'd attracted, he wondered what wrong life
<br />
decision led him into this situation...but his brooding was interrupted by
<br />
the familiar-sounding roar of the hovercraft as it smote his pursuers.  Now
<br />
he was the one rescued as the hovercraft swooped down from the sky and
<br />
grabbed him from the earth.
<br />

<br />
Now Joseph, Sonic, and his hologram raced through Robotropolis, being
<br />
blasted at by anti-aircraft cannons. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Joe!&quot; Sonic yelled, ducking a few bursts of lazer fire.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, Sonic?&quot; was the reply from Joseph as he took control of the craft.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Do you have,&quot; Sonic hollered, &quot;a plan!?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph shouted back, &quot;No!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;That makes the both of us!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Good!&quot; was the last retort, as a shot from a 'Bot plane finally crippled
<br />
the craft, sending it spiraling down...down...
<br />

<br />
^L
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The two hedgehogs jumped from the craft instinctively, but they both soon
<br />
realized bailing out about five thousand feet over hostile territory with
<br />
not a parachute between them is not a good idea.
<br />

<br />
Sonic and Joseph let out a long, collective scream as they plummeted toward
<br />
a rather unpleasant part of Mobius, waiting for the bright light to start
<br />
shining before them.  After all, neither of them could *fly*...
<br />

<br />
However, Dulcy could.  And she cracked the whip in the nick of time, and
<br />
saved the two hedgehogs from becoming greasy spots on the pavement.  As
<br />
they calmed down and flew away from Robotropolis, the banter began again.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;my life just flashed before my eyes!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;My breakfast just flashed before mine,&quot; Joseph said weakly.
<br />

<br />
The rest of the flight passed in silence.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Everyone was glad to see Joseph and Sonic when they returned.  Well, that
<br />
is, except Sally.  After accepting a round of applause, Sally dragged the
<br />
both of them back into her hut, demanding an explaination.
<br />

<br />
&quot;What did you two think you were doing out there?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Just getting my butt saved!&quot; was Sonic's initial reply.  &quot;If Joseph hadn't
<br />
pulled the hat-trick and had his diversion come get me, I would've been
<br />
fried!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
&quot;You shouldn't have stayed to begin with, Sonic Hedgehog!  If you knew that
<br />
the odds were against you--&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tell *that* to the people I just bailed out of there, Sal!&quot;
<br />

<br />
A pause.
<br />

<br />
Sally's voice grew softer.  &quot;Sonic...those people would have been there
<br />
tomorrow.  We could have gotten more out if you could have waited--&quot;  She
<br />
immediately saw the response forming in Sonic's head.  &quot;--and, yes, I know,
<br />
you aren't the waiting type.&quot;  Her voice rose again.  &quot;But what you did 
<br />
was foolish!  It was insane!  It was--&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Honorable,&quot; Joseph said.  &quot;and it was something I would have done, if I
<br />
would have been in the same place.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally looked over at Joseph, and shook her index finger at him harshly. 
<br />
&quot;And *you*, you maniac, what possessed you to go and invade Snively's--&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Packbell's, ma'am.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally blinked.  &quot;What?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Packbell's, ma'am.  Packbell has unseated Snively.  He is in charge now.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally's anger left her.  &quot;Dear Lord...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded.  &quot;It is rather unfortunate.  But I was able to get important
<br />
information out of his computers, and capture a piece of very sensitive
<br />
technology.&quot;  He hefted the cannon out in front of Sally.  &quot;I need to run
<br />
tests on this, but I believe it may utilize an...alien technology.  Perhaps
<br />
it would give us a clue to who is helping...umm, Packbell now, I guess.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He put his hand on Sally's shoulder.  &quot;Boss, I know what I did was
<br />
unsanctioned by you, and was certainly an unwise thing to do tactically. 
<br />
But I did get positive results, and I will have more developments for you
<br />
in the coming days as I analyse this data.&quot;  Then, Joseph bowed slightly.
<br />
&quot;I will make this up to you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally just blinked, her initial anger defused.  &quot;Well, okay, Joseph.  Just
<br />
don't pull any more crazy stunts like this again.&quot;  She coughed, regaining
<br />
her normal voice.  &quot;Dismissed.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph smiled softly.  &quot;Affirmative.&quot;  And then, he walked out of the hut.
<br />

<br />
Sonic blinked.  &quot;Packbell's in charge?  Way Past Uncool, Sal!  What'll we
<br />
do now?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally turned away from Sonic, and looked out the window.  &quot;I don't know,
<br />
Sonic...I don't know...&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph returned to his lab, and placed the cannon down in front of him.
<br />
He stared at it for a while, transfixed on the information that identified
<br />
the kind of weapon, its make, and its year.  He stared at it for a while,
<br />
hoping that if he glared at it long enough, the familiar language would
<br />
change, as well as its information.
<br />

<br />
He touched it, feeling the steely perfection of its design.  It was
<br />
probably built by a machine, yet it retained that familiar workmanship
<br />
that was so familiar to him...
<br />

<br />
He could not let them know.  Not yet.  He would be lynched, burned, and
<br />
possibly drawn and quartered; and his work would die here, on this
<br />
desolate, primitive world so far from civilized space.
<br />

<br />
He took a power sander from the table, and fired it up to its full power.
<br />
In a burst of strength, he slowly tore away the paint that held the
<br />
accursed phrase on the side of the weapon...
<br />

<br />
&quot;UR'THAEN PLASMA CANNON, MARK 26-ALPHA.  MODEL YEAR -- 8000 PE...&quot;
