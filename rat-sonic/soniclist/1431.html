JADED VIEWS
<br />
By Thad &quot;X&quot; Boyd and Steve &quot;Maxl&quot; Tramer
<br />
<br /><br />FOREWORD AND LEGAL STUFF
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This work is written by Thaddeus Boyd and Stephen Tramer.  If you
<br />
wish to copy this, fine, but keep it unchanged.  If you use it to make a
<br />
quick buck for yourself, we will hunt you down and garrote you (either
<br />
that, or prosecute you to the maximum extent of the law).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following work is purely fictitious (and if you didn't figure
<br />
that out for yourself, you should consult a psychiatrist), except for the
<br />
fact that a few characters herein ARE comparable to some real people we
<br />
know (with different names, of course).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd like to thank anyone and everyone who has ever written a Sonic
<br />
the Hedgehog story, because I draw many ideas from these.  I'd also like to
<br />
thank the programmers at Square Soft who created FINAL FANTASY 3, since
<br />
I've made a few jokes in this story about that game, as well as taken a
<br />
good portion of the opera scene therein.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should anything come up in this story that conflicts with any other
<br />
Sonic stories -- past, present, or future -- just say that this is an
<br />
&quot;alternate reality&quot; and that the events here occurred differently for some reason.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All characters herein are created by SErvice and GAmes (SEGA), and
<br />

<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 1
<br />
ACCESS DENIED
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAN'T PROBE TARGET.  The disheartening words flashed across
<br />
Nicole's screen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shoot,&quot; Kate said, running a hand through her long, brown hair.
<br />
&quot;Even with both of us hooked up to Nicole, Kabuki is still immune to our scanning.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, Sis,&quot; Hedgehog X replied.  &quot;Of course, keep in mind that
<br />
we're new to this telepathy thing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; the fifteen-year-old human girl replied, &quot;but you'd think
<br />
that at least MAYBE two of the most powerful entities on the planet would
<br />
be able to do SOMETHING!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't get down on yuhself, Sugah,&quot; Bunnie said to Kate.
<br />
&quot;Remember, ah friend here,&quot; and with this, she pointed at the unconscious
<br />
Siamese cat with probes on her head, &quot;has had a pretty mysterious past.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Please,&quot; HX said, &quot;don't talk about mysterious pasts around me...I
<br />
might start puking.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog X wasn't exaggerating much.  His past had been a major
<br />
pain.  After the Life Jades had been stolen from the village of Bluebrook
<br />
by Robotnik, a new Gem Child was needed to take the place of Willind, now
<br />
called Packbell, who had been the Child of the Jades of Life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without the Jades, creating a new life-form wasn't easy for the
<br />
other Power Gems, so the new life-form, who was meant to be a clone of
<br />
Mobius's champion, Sonic the Hedgehog, came out wrong.  He was perpetually
<br />
eleven years old (the age Sonic had been when he was cloned), as well as
<br />
being purple and not having Sonic's speed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For these reasons, Xavier -- the name given to the new Child of the
<br />
Super Emeralds -- was banished and told to stay away from the Knothole
<br />
Freedom Fighters.  However, after he pulled them out of a few scrapes, and
<br />
was forced to reveal his true identity, the Emeralds cured his speed
<br />
problem and let him join with the Knothole crowd.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make matters worse, Xavier -- better known as Hedgehog X -- had
<br />
the mind of two beings.  He had once been sent to an odd alternate version
<br />
of Mobius, a planet called Terra (known to some as Earth), where his mind
<br />
was mixed with that of a sentient -- albeit deceased -- robot named Zero.
<br />
With Zero's mind came the ability to become a cyborg -- to be robotic and
<br />
yet keep his free will -- a design which Uncle Chuck would no doubt follow,
<br />
once the war was over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's get back to the task at hand, shall we?&quot; asked Mega Man X
<br />
(more commonly known as just &quot;X&quot;), a sentient robot from Earth who was best
<br />
friends with Hedgehog X.  &quot;Bookshire, Rotor, how long do you think it'll
<br />
take to work this out?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Could be hours,&quot; the aging raccoon replied.  &quot;We could use some
<br />
help from any of you who know electronics.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That'd be me,&quot; said X and HX at the same time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me too,&quot; Bunnie spoke up.  &quot;Ah'm kahnda partial to 'em, if y'all
<br />
know what Ah mean.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally agreed to help, too, along with a few others.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, 'scuse me,&quot; a voice said, &quot;but don't you think we should
<br />
search Kabook's room for any clues?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone in the room looked at Sonic the Hedgehog, the one who had
<br />
spoken, stared for a few seconds, and simultaneously hit themselves in the
<br />
heads in a &quot;why didn't I think of that?&quot; sort of way.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 2
<br />
THE LETTER
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kabuki's room is ze peegsty!&quot; came a voice from somewhere under
<br />
all the junk.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me about it, Ant,&quot; Sonic muttered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do I have to do this?&quot; came a third voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To find out what's wrong with Kabuki, Rack,&quot; Sonic replied to the
<br />
unmistakable voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not 'Rack',&quot; the voice replied testily, &quot;Amaroq.  AM-uh-rack
<br />
Ka-PYU-jin.  Amaroq Kapugen, meaning 'the great wolf'.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever you say, Rack,&quot; Sonic replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black wolf growled angrily.  &quot;Why should we be helping that
<br />
cat, anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Any enemy of yours has to be a friend of mine, mon,&quot; Knuckles
<br />
growled from somewhere in the pile.  Amaroq had a really weird sense of
<br />
humor and often insulted his team-members, which made him unpopular with
<br />
most of the Freedom Fighters.  &quot;You are a total...HEY!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A total HEY?&quot; Tails wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whuzzap?&quot; Sonic asked.  &quot;Find something?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A letter of some sort,&quot; the echidna replied.  &quot;Yecch...it's all greasy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does it say?&quot; Sonic demanded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The handwriting's awful, Sonic,&quot; Knuckles observed, &quot;but I THINK I
<br />
can make out what it says:
<br />
<br />Deer Cabookee,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want you for my bryd.  i'm comInG 4 u.
<br />
Uh-oh!  It'z 4 in the Afternon!  I don't kno what that meanz, but I guess
<br />
I'yd better stop writhing this letter!
<br />
-The WaNDring SyKKo
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Either that, or something about rabbits and mosquitoes in the cheese.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who's this...wandering...what's-his-name?&quot; Tails asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You born on a farm, son?&quot; Amaroq asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not your son,&quot; Tails replied, &quot;and please answer my question.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uhhhh...I don't know either,&quot; Amaroq replied.  &quot;I just felt like
<br />
saying that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey,&quot; said Sonic, who was now standing behind Knuckles and reading
<br />
over his shoulder, &quot;what are those things taped to the letter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmmm,&quot; the echidna said, &quot;they appear to be tickets to see an opera.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ze opera?&quot; Antoine asked, clapping his hands.  &quot;Magnifique!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Since when have there been operas on Mobius?&quot; Tails inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before you were born, mon,&quot; Knuckles replied.  &quot;Before that ol'
<br />
Robuttnik took over.  The one decent thing he ever did was ban them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not too great, eh?&quot; asked Tails, rhetorically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got it,&quot; said Amaroq.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sacre bleu!&quot; Antoine cried, outraged.  &quot;Ze operas were ze peak of
<br />
ze entertainment!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, guys,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;what-say we go talk to the others about this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ya, mon,&quot; Knuckles said.  &quot;They might have gotten some development
<br />
in Kabuki's condition, too, eh?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 3
<br />
DRAWN BLADES
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grimy badger, clad in a shirt with a strange design, holey
<br />
pants, and sandals, kicked the contraption again, then checked his watch.
<br />
&quot;I been doin' dis fo' ten minutes now!&quot; he griped in a thick New York accent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not going too, well, eh ol' buddy?&quot; asked the figure in the dark
<br />
suit and hood in a similar voice, without the New York accent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, it ain't, Tracks,&quot; said the badger.  &quot;I never did figure out
<br />
how to woik dis t'ingy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maxl,&quot; said the hooded figure, &quot;take it from your buddy, Tracker
<br />
-- you're a total klutz when it comes to machines.  Anyways, it's time for
<br />
your fencing lesson.  You're getting better.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, okay,&quot; said Maxl, kicking the contraption one last time
<br />
before he went into his house to practice fencing with Tracker.  On his way
<br />
into the house, Maxl looked at his watch, then mumbled something about
<br />
operas and Jade.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracker drew his blade.
<br />
&quot;Wow!&quot; said Maxl, &quot;Dat's a good pictcha!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Tracker.  &quot;Your art lessons really helped.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two friends were sitting on Maxl's green carpet, the only clean
<br />
thing left  in his house.  After fencing with Tracker, Maxl had agreed to
<br />
give him an art lesson.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, since you won that last round of fencing, I want to take you
<br />
on again.&quot; said Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deal,&quot; answered Maxl, &quot;but you pull your Big Blade and I'll take
<br />
ya outta da picture.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine by me,  just wait and see....&quot; said Tracker, &quot;Just don't snap
<br />
your fingers this time, okay?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl nodded.  The house floor was all hardwood with no furniture or
<br />
mats, except for the green carpet.  For some reason, Maxl just couldn't
<br />
stand having any blood on his beautiful carpet.  Some might say that was
<br />
the only sane thing about him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;TO AHMS!&quot; yelled Maxl across his living room to Tracker.  Both
<br />
drew sizable two-foot long daggers.  Tracker advanced on Maxl, the thought
<br />
of spilling blood on his mind.  Maxl advanced on Tracker, the thought of
<br />
meatloaf on his mind.  Soon, both were in striking distance of each-other.
<br />
Maxl decided to try to trick Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEY!  A big meatloaf's behind ya!&quot; he yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh??&quot; asked Tracker, looking over his shoulder.  Maxl struck at
<br />
Tracker, who pivoted and parried.  Tracker tried the same trick back on
<br />
him, which was advantageous.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WAIT!&quot; yelled Tracker, &quot;The meatloaf is behind you now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;FOOD!&quot; yelled Maxl.  He spun around, and was stabbed in the back
<br />
by Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;QUICK!&quot; yelled Tracker.  &quot;Clap your hands!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl did so, and got up off of the floor.  He no longer was
<br />
bleeding, and the hole where he had been stabbed was gone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; Maxl said, checking his watch.  &quot;We've sparred fo' ten
<br />
minutes.  We kin stop now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, a robot was watching everything from the underbrush a
<br />
few hundred yards away.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 4
<br />
KABUKI COMES TO
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACCESS GRANTED.  The Freedom Fighters cheered as they saw the
<br />
message displayed on the screen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now we need to send the necessary stimulation signal,&quot; Bookshire
<br />
said.  &quot;Computer, run a low-power electric impulse, similar to brainwaves.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabuki, lying on the floor, gave a slight twitch, but didn't do
<br />
anything afterwards.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;I guess we've only got one choice left --
<br />
shock treatment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaroq, who had come in a few minutes before, cracked his knuckles.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;This is gonna be FUN!&quot; he proclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, there was a high screeching sound -- the sort a cat makes
<br />
when stepped on -- and Kabuki was up, claws bared.  &quot;You just try it,
<br />
wolf!&quot; she hissed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I could take you on any day of the week,&quot; Amaroq replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Break it up,&quot; came a voice, &quot;Or you'll be dealing with ME.&quot;  The
<br />
voice was exactly the same as X's, but it didn't come from X.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;X3!&quot; X shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the flesh,&quot; X3 replied, &quot;or, rather, the silicon skin alloy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mega Man X3 was an alternate version of X, who had crossed paths
<br />
with the Freedom Fighters on a distant planet.  The fact that he existed in
<br />
the same reality as X had caused them both to malfunction, so they had
<br />
worked hard to become different.  At this point, the weapon systems were
<br />
different, and X3 had a strange morphing capability that allowed him to
<br />
change shape, but their minds and personalities were still about the same.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See anything on your perimeter scan?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As a matter of fact, yes,&quot; the robot replied.  &quot;I saw a badger and
<br />
a -- a something; I couldn't tell what it was because it was dressed in a
<br />
black hood and cloak -- who were fencing in a rather, um, unique way.  They
<br />
said something about meatloaf.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get any names?&quot; the princess asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah.  One of them called himself...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Wandering Psycho,&quot; Kabuki interrupted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, actually, the badger called himself something like Maxwell,
<br />
and the shadowy guy said he was the Tracker.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut up,&quot; Kabuki commanded.  &quot;He sent me a note...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This?&quot; Knuckles inquired, and showed everyone the message they'd
<br />
found in the heap of stuff.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Kabuki said.  &quot;It caused me to lose consciousness.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because of its utter stupidity?&quot; Amaroq asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; Hedgehog X spoke up.  &quot;Because it triggered something in her
<br />
memory that had been somehow blocked out...right, Kabuki?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Been there, done that,&quot; was the only explanation Hedgehog X gave.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's just say it's something that you newbies weren't there for,&quot;
<br />
X said.  &quot;Newbies&quot; was the term that he used whenever referring to Freedom
<br />
Fighters who were new to the business, as opposed to veterans such as Sonic
<br />
and Kate, who were there from the start.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nevermind that,&quot; Rotor said.  &quot;Kabuki, what can you tell us about
<br />
this Maxwell?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;To tell you the truth,&quot; Kabuki said, &quot;I'd rather SHOW you.&quot;  The
<br />
jade ring she always wore started glowing, and displayed an image on the
<br />
wall.  It was totally black and green, rather like a Game Boy screen, but
<br />
no-one seemed to mind.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 5
<br />
THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision appeared blurry at first, but then slowly began to
<br />
resolve, and then sounds started coming up.  Soon, even though it was
<br />
green, the Freedom Fighters watching could make out every color through
<br />
some enchantment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The picture showed a badger, running into a tree repeatedly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fool!&quot; he screamed in a feminine voice.  &quot;You're...OOF!...going to
<br />
get ...OOF!...us all...OOF!...killed!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lay off!&quot; he said in another voice, male with a New York accent.
<br />
&quot;I'm...OOF!...goin' fo' a new...OOF!...record!&quot;  He checked his watch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've been running...OOF!...into the tree for...OOF!...twenty-five
<br />
minutes now!&quot; he said triumphantly, this time using the same male voice,
<br />
only without the accent.  &quot;Excellent!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The figure of a Siamese cat approached silently from behind.  It
<br />
was clearly Kabuki.  &quot;Ummm...what exactly do you think you're doing?&quot; she inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Making...OOF!...new...OOF!...records!&quot; the New York accent replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stop...OOF!...this at...OOF!...once!&quot; screamed the female voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've...OOF!...already made a new...OOF!...record!&quot; the normal
<br />
male voice pointed out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine.  I'll...OOF!...stop!&quot;  The badger stopped abruptly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I want control of the body next!&quot; the normal male voice said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!&quot; the female voice replied.  &quot;You'll just do something stupid
<br />
like Maxl!  I should have control!&quot;  There was a tremendous argument.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Schizophrenia,&quot; Kabuki murmured to herself.  &quot;Maybe I should put
<br />
the poor thing out of its misery...&quot;  She drew her katana and got ready to
<br />
strike, but just before she would have made the killing blow, the ring on
<br />
her finger started to glow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What the BLEEP?!&quot; Kabuki gasped (she commonly used the word
<br />
&quot;BLEEP&quot; when she felt like swearing).  &quot;It's that gem the fox gave me!
<br />
It's...it's POSSESSED!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eerie green glow emanated from the ring, and shone on the
<br />
badger.  Its eyes grew big, and the green light grew so bright that no-one
<br />
could see a thing.  When their vision was cleared, they saw that there was
<br />
no longer one badger, but three.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One badger looked the same as before, only a bit dirtier, and was
<br />
wearing weird clothing.  &quot;What's goin' on?!&quot; he asked in the New York accent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think...we're...finally...free,&quot; contemplated a dark-clad badger
<br />
with a hood hanging down from his outfit, in the unaccented male voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Finally,&quot; sighed the female badger, who was not only wearing
<br />
green, but whose fur was green to match.  &quot;I've had to put up with running
<br />
into trees and other stupid stuff of the like for years now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The green badger contemplated for a moment, then growled, &quot;And it's
<br />
YOUR FAULT!&quot;  She struck at the normally-colored badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maxl!  Get down!&quot; shouted the dark-clad badger, and threw himself
<br />
into Maxl to knock him out of the way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll pay for that, Tracker,&quot; hissed the green badger, eyes narrowing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No prob, Jade,&quot; said Maxl.  &quot;Will you take cash...OR CREDIT?!&quot;
<br />
With that, he pulled a credit card out of his pocket, and threw it at Jade,
<br />
breaking her fingernail.  &quot;Don't leave home without it,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade screamed in outrage.  &quot;I'LL DESTROY YOU FOR THAT!!!&quot; she shouted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not so fast!&quot; Kabuki said, leaping in Jade's way.  &quot;Name's Kabuki
<br />
Ninomiya.  Normally, I'd sympathize with someone who got their fingernail
<br />
broken, but I'm against the slaughter of dumb animals!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah!&quot; Maxl chimed in.  &quot;Hey, WAIT A MINUTE...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're not dumb!&quot; Tracker said.  &quot;Listen: Two times three
<br />
is...umm...six!  Four times eighteen is...umm...NOT six!  So there!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;GO!&quot; Kabuki commanded.  &quot;I'll take care of this BLEEP!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracker and Maxl started running.  &quot;One good turn equals another!&quot;
<br />
Tracker said mathematically.  &quot;You've saved us...we'll save you some time
<br />
in the future!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After checking his watch, Maxl shouted, &quot;Kabuki!  I'll be back for
<br />
ya!&quot; and blew her a kiss.  For some reason, a lightning bolt appeared a
<br />
second later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmmf...must be a storm brewin',&quot; Jade observed.  &quot;I HATE storms!
<br />
They ruin my hair!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabuki ran after Jade, but the badger turned around and clicked her
<br />
tongue.  &quot;You will forget about me,&quot; she said.  &quot;In fact, you will forget
<br />
about this whole occurrence!&quot;  Kabuki's jade ring glowed again, and Kabuki fainted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vision ended.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 6
<br />
BADGER HUNTING
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long period of silence.  Tails was the first to break
<br />
it, with one word: &quot;Whoa.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That about summarizes it,&quot; Kabuki said.  &quot;I was pretty surprised,
<br />
too, when I got the letter from one of them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hence the catatonic stupor,&quot; Bookshire finished.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y'know what I think?&quot; Sonic asked rhetorically.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just about everyone in the room replied, &quot;Let's go find those badgers!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's set up the away team,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;We can't have too many
<br />
gone, but we need a sizable amount, in case of trouble.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going,&quot; Kabuki said.  &quot;After all, it's MY past.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll go,&quot; Amaroq said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Count me in,&quot; Knuckles said.  &quot;This should be fun!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In that case, I WON'T go,&quot; Amaroq said in disgust.  Knuckles was
<br />
the one Freedom Fighter who he not only needled, but loathed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know where they are,&quot; X3 said, &quot;so I have to go, too.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll go,&quot; Hedgehog X said.  &quot;After all, I'm a bit of a schizo myself!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!&quot; came Zero's voice.  &quot;Just cuz we've got two minds in one
<br />
doesn't make us schizo!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It kinda goes without saying that I'm going,&quot; Sonic said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I should go,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;After all, one level-headed
<br />
individual -- or two, depending on how you look at it -- isn't enough.  HX
<br />
could use some help in controlling you four.  Besides, I'm the only one
<br />
here who can use Nicole...without messing with it, that is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sounds good to me,&quot; said Kate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have a good time!&quot; X said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group jumped into one of the Warp Rings that were the exit of
<br />
the Hidden Palace (where the Freedom Fighters had been living ever since
<br />
the destruction of their second Knothole), and found themselves a mere mile
<br />
from where the badgers were living.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to where X3 had seen Maxl and Tracker.  The hut was still
<br />
there, but the badgers weren't!  All they found was a note on the door:
<br />
<br />Deer Cabookee
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Im sory if you came by wile i was goNe.  i'm at the opra, pleez com
<br />
joyn me n tRacKer.  uSe the tikkets I gave u.
<br />
Luv,
<br />
M_at_)( |_ (the Wandring SyKKo)
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yecch,&quot; Kabuki muttered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, wait,&quot; X3 said.  &quot;There's another note below that!&quot;
<br />
<br />Deer Jayd
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wasnt riten by Maxl, but an eevil fayk Maxl.  Pleas do not pay
<br />
any attenshin 2 it!  PLEAS!  Thanx.
<br />
Sined,
<br />
Not M_at_)(|_
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, great,&quot; HX muttered.  &quot;Looks like we have to go to an opera
<br />
and stop Jade from killing these guys!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No big loss if she does,&quot; Sonic commented.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, guys,&quot; Kabuki said, &quot;we're going to that opera.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But we don't know where it is!&quot; Sally said.  &quot;Maybe the address is
<br />
on the tickets...get them out!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Umm...I don't have 'em,&quot; Sonic said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me neither,&quot; said HX.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out everyone had forgotten the tickets.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not to worry,&quot; Knuckles said.  He looked at his watch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WHAT DO YOU MEAN, 'NOT TO WORRY'?!&quot; X3 screeched.  &quot;YOU'RE ACTING
<br />
JUST LIKE MAXL!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No I'm not...it's a wrist communicator, mon!&quot; Knuckles explained.
<br />
&quot;Knuckles to team!  Come in, team!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's up?&quot; came a voice through the speaker in his watch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We need transportation,&quot; Knuckles explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's your location?&quot; came the voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally whipped out Nicole and a connector cord, and plugged it into
<br />
a small socket in Knuckles' watch.  &quot;I'm sending you our coordinates,&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vector, take Mighty and Charmee to the Hidden Palace,&quot; Knuckles
<br />
said.  &quot;Get ANT 100, and grab those opera tickets!  Send Espio to see if he
<br />
can find any badgers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Check,&quot; the voice replied.  &quot;This is Vector, out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the signal died, they faintly heard the voice saying, &quot;See,
<br />
Mighty?  I TOLD you my headphones were good for something!&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 7
<br />
IN THE GREEN
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade glanced at her watch, then looked off the cliff at Mobius'
<br />
only remaining opera house, which, for some reason, had not been found by
<br />
Robotnik.  So that was where Maxl and that fool Tracker were.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as she was concerned, the schizophrenic Maxl who had created
<br />
her could die.  It was his fault that Tracker, who would have made a great
<br />
ally otherwise, was so stupid from banging his head into trees so many times.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade wondered what would happen to her if she killed Maxl, but she
<br />
didn't care if she died.  She had nothing to live for.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why did you choose an opera house anyway, you fool?&quot; Jade grumbled
<br />
to herself.  She checked her watch, then walked away from the edge of the
<br />
cliff, and started on her way down the hill to the opera house.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Found the opera house,&quot; came a whispered voice nearby.  &quot;Found a
<br />
green badger, too.&quot;  It was quiet, but didn't escape Jade's hearing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade turned around, but saw nothing.  Whoever she had heard had
<br />
somehow disappeared.  &quot;I guess I'm being followed by someone who's pretty
<br />
good at the biz,&quot; she mused.  &quot;Well, let's see how they like THIS!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade clicked her heels together, and muttered &quot;There's no place
<br />
like home!&quot;  A hideous grin shone on her face, and she disappeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She teleported!&quot; Espio gasped into his wrist communicator.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She can't have gotten far,&quot; Kabuki's voice replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Teleporting takes power,&quot; observed X3.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not to mention the fact that, the farther you teleport, the more
<br />
your head hurts afterwards!&quot; Hedgehog X put in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; Espio's voice crackled on Knuckles' watch, &quot;I'll check the perimeter.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good,&quot; Knuckles said.  &quot;Knuckles out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When do you think the others'll show up?&quot; inquired Sonic,
<br />
impatiently.  &quot;Why didn't you just let me run back and get the tickets?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're not even on the Floating Island anymore, Sonic,&quot; Sally
<br />
reminded him.  &quot;There's no way you could run back.  As for the time they're
<br />
taking, well, you really need to learn some...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THERE IT IS!&quot; X3 shouted.  &quot;ANT 100!&quot;  Sure enough, the silver
<br />
ship was quite close on the horizon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ANT, the Advanced Neurological Test, had been Rotor and Bookshire's
<br />
first test of high-level artificial intelligence.  ANT was created to keep
<br />
house, but as Rotor and Bookshire learned more advanced programming, they
<br />
upgraded it more.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As ANT went through many changes, and even did some Freedom
<br />
Fighting, he became dubbed by Sonic &quot;ANT 100&quot;, and his latest enhancement
<br />
allowed him to transform into an aircraft.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The silver ship landed in front of the small group of Freedom
<br />
Fighters, and a door opened.  They walked in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Land about a mile away from the coordinates Espio gave us,&quot; Sonic
<br />
said.  &quot;We'll get the jump on 'em.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 8
<br />
AN EVENING AT THE IMPROV
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Maxl stated, as he got into the opera house by picking the
<br />
lock with one of his credit cards, &quot;I hope Jade was fooled by ah fake note.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me too,&quot; said Tracker.   &quot;Even with the Big Blade I'm not ready to
<br />
cross her path yet...for some reason I wanna go back to that tree where we
<br />
set our record.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Which one?  Da tree that gave us brain damage, or da tree dat got
<br />
struck by lightnin' foity times?&quot; said Maxl.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Weren't those both the same tree?&quot; asked Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; said Maxl, &quot;I hear sometin'!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe it's the rats....or maybe it's Kabuki.....or maybe it's
<br />
Jade!&quot; said Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nah,&quot; said Maxl, &quot;we're too smart fo' her.&quot;  he yawned, and a
<br />
tornado swept through the theater, avoiding Maxl and Tracker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  What was that?!&quot; came a distant voice.  &quot;Maxl better not
<br />
have learned about his magical powers yet!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's her!&quot; whispered Maxl to Tracker.  But neither saw anyone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe not,&quot; said Tracker, &quot;maybe it was Jade!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stop bein' so...so...para...para...paraplegic!
<br />
No...it's...umm....paranoid!  Yeah!  Dat's it!&quot; said Maxl.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; said Tracker, &quot;I see someone, but it's not Jade.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's her!&quot; squealed Maxl in delight.  &quot;C'mon, let's set up!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, okay,&quot; Tracker finally agreed.  He went up into the balcony
<br />
to watch Maxl's performance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl, the only player in the opera, started singing terribly
<br />
off-key.  Tracker clapped his hands over his ears, causing the floor to
<br />
turn into a 5-foot-thick pile of Jell-O.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl, not noticing this development, kept singing.  A few minutes
<br />
later, the group of six Freedom Fighters came through the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tracker!&quot; X3 exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracker nodded his hooded head, then looked at the Siamese cat
<br />
glaring at him.  &quot;Ah!  Kabuki!  We've been expecting you!  Please sit down!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not about to sit with the likes of...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracker belched, causing the entire group of Freedom Fighters to
<br />
plop down in the seats.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl was on a very dramatic scene at this point.  Of course,
<br />
playing all the characters made it seem more humorous than dramatic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl, dressed as a woman, sang &quot;Dra-a-co, I've waited so long.  I
<br />
knew you'd come!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl tossed off the woman's outfit, revealing a masculine outfit
<br />
underneath.  He sang something about marrying Maria.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then came the duel, which was incredibly difficult to be done with
<br />
one player.  He'd toss off one outfit, showing the next underneath, and
<br />
jump to one side, then strike, then change outfits and jump back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is TERRIBLE,&quot; remarked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hasn't changed a bit,&quot; Sally muttered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaroq said nothing, but looked around for an airsickness bag.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Tracker screamed.  &quot;JADE!&quot;  He pointed at the rafters
<br />
above them.  Jade was standing there, about to push a four-ton weight on
<br />
Maxl's head.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 9
<br />
A WEIGHTY DECISION
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tracker bolted for the door, and before anyone could stop him, he
<br />
was gone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade, meanwhile, looked at her watch.  &quot;ARGH!&quot; she said in
<br />
frustration.  &quot;It's gonna take five minutes to drop this thing!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've got to stop her!&quot; Kabuki shouted.  &quot;I'll go after her!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm comin, too,&quot; X3 growled, then turned into a tiger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine,&quot; Kabuki said.  &quot;Let's go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran into the next room, and tried to enter the door to the
<br />
rafters, but it was locked.  &quot;BLEEP!&quot; she shouted.  &quot;X3...can't you do
<br />
something?&quot;  One thing about Kabuki was that she knew absolutely nothing
<br />
about the capabilities of X and X3.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The unlocking mechanism is probably in another room,&quot; X3 observed.
<br />
&nbsp;&quot;I'll tell the others to check it out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can't get through,&quot; crackled the voice on Knuckles' watch.
<br />
&quot;Take the door to your right!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Check,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;C'mon.&quot;  She and the other three ran to the
<br />
next room.  &quot;Four switches...let's each pull one.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles pulled his.  The sound of a dog barking was heard.  &quot;Wrong
<br />
switch, mon,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic pulled his, and the lights went out.  After turning them back
<br />
on, he said, &quot;Light switch.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hedgehog X pulled his switch.  A hole appeared beneath his feet,
<br />
and he fell onto the stage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess that leaves this one,&quot; Sally said.  She pulled it.  &quot;It
<br />
should be open,&quot; she said into Knuckles' watch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is,&quot; X3's voice replied.  &quot;Let's go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll be on stage,&quot; Sonic said, and the three jumped down the hole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabuki and X3 walked on the rafters.  Every so often, some small
<br />
rats would bother them, but were quickly disposed of...remember, Kabuki's a
<br />
cat, and X3 was in tiger form.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, they reached Jade, who grinned, satisfied.  &quot;Nice try, but
<br />
I've already pushed the weight far enough!&quot;  It was true...the weight was
<br />
clearly about to fall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NOT SO FAST!&quot; shouted a voice.  Espio suddenly appeared, and
<br />
jumped on Jade's head.  The chameleon covered Jade's eyes, and while she
<br />
moved about wildly, Kabuki drew her katana, and threw it at Jade's neck.
<br />
Espio jumped off Jade's head and clung to the wall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blade never reached its mark, because suddenly, all the strain
<br />
on the rafter they were fighting on caused it to give.  Everything fell:
<br />
Jade, Kabuki, X3, the katana...and the weight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like it's that time again,&quot; muttered Hedgehog X, who was
<br />
always bearing the brunt of attacks.  He ran to where the weight was
<br />
landing, pushed Maxl out of the way, and caught it.  The velocity caused
<br />
him to fall through the Jell-O floor...and several hard-wood floors, too.
<br />
He ended up in the third basement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade looked at her watch.  &quot;Five minutes, exactly,&quot; she said
<br />
satisfactorily.  Then, she saw Maxl, oblivious to what was going on around
<br />
him.  She caught Kabuki's katana as it fell, and went up behind Maxl.  She
<br />
got into the proper stance to make a killing blow.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 10
<br />
THE BATTLE
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BLAM!  The opera house wall to Jade's left exploded.  A voice
<br />
shouted, as Jade was beginning the swing, &quot;Maxl!  Your shoes are untied!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl bent down to examine his shoes.  Jade swung over his head, and
<br />
the force of the swing caused her to trip over him and land the katana in
<br />
the wall.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade glared angrily at the one who had spoken -- Amaroq.  &quot;Stupid,
<br />
interfering wolf!&quot; she said hatefully.  &quot;You've just sealed your fate!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amaroq threw back his head and laughed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jade?&quot; Maxl said, and looked up.  &quot;How did ya follow me?  I'll
<br />
kill ya...just as soon as I'm done figurin' out how to tie my shoes!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa,&quot; Amaroq said, &quot;what kind of shampoo do you use, Valvoline or
<br />
Q-Lube?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pennzoil,&quot; Maxl replied, and looked back down at his sandals.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade advanced on Amaroq, ready to strike.  Suddenly, she was kicked
<br />
from behind, knocking her down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kabuki smiled.  &quot;Had enough, witch?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not quite,&quot; Jade replied.  She grinned, and Kabuki's ring started
<br />
to glow.  Kabuki disappeared.  &quot;Who's next?&quot; Jade asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That would be me,&quot; Amaroq replied.  He activated his
<br />
super-powerful Initiation 27 to defeat Jade.  However, Jade crossed her
<br />
eyes and phased, so all the Initiation 27 succeeded in doing was destroying
<br />
the Jell-O floor, causing everyone to fall to the first basement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll deal with you later,&quot; Amaroq growled, &quot;when I regenerate.
<br />
For now, well...&quot;  He whistled, and a bunch of other Freedom Fighters appeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's going on?!&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We had Dulcy follow ANT 100,&quot; Amaroq explained, &quot;A few of us rode
<br />
her, and the rest followed, some on foot and some in the biplane.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Jade was distracted, X3 attacked her from behind, grabbing
<br />
her arm in his mouth.  X appeared, and powered-up his X-Buster to destroy her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade's arm suddenly turned white.  It singed X3's mouth, causing
<br />
him to revert to his normal form.  X fired, but Jade dodged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic tried to spin-dash Jade from one end; Knuckles from the
<br />
other.  Jade jumped, and they hit each-other, knocking themselves out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmm,&quot; Maxl said to himself.  &quot;Good ting I brought dis
<br />
duct-tape...&quot;  He wrapped the tape around his sandals.  &quot;Dat's bettah!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade ran, but was tripped by Sally, and flew into Bunnie's arms.
<br />
Bunnie held Jade, as Rotor appeared with his trusty cattle-prod.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Enough!&quot; Jade shouted.  She clicked her heels together, and said,
<br />
&quot;There's no place like home!&quot;  She, Bunnie, and Maxl all disappeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They've teleported!&quot; X exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, then, let's find 'em!&quot; Amaroq growled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Check,&quot; X said.  &quot;We'll split into groups of two.  I'll go with
<br />
Tails, and check the surrounding areas.&quot;  He climbed the wall back up to
<br />
what used to be the first floor, and went to the opening.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll get Dulcy,&quot; Sally said.  &quot;We'll see if Jade's in any trees.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll take you out, Aunt Sally,&quot; Tails said.  He flew up to the
<br />
opening, holding Sally's hands.  He let her go outside, then followed X.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll stay here and tend to the unconscious ones,&quot; Rotor said diligently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I should stay here, too,&quot; X3 said.  &quot;I'm still in some pain.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Much as I hate to admit it,&quot; Amaroq said, &quot;I can't really do much
<br />
at this point.  Using Initiation 27 wore me out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I weel stay too,&quot; Antoine said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll pair up with Xavi...&quot; Kate broke off in the middle of her
<br />
sentence.  &quot;Say...where IS Xavier?&quot;
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 11
<br />
GOING DOWN
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I haven't seen him since he left!&quot; Rotor exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll find him,&quot; Kate said.  A faint glow surrounded her.
<br />
Suddenly, she exclaimed, &quot;He went this way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She dove down the hole Hedgehog X and the weight had made (which
<br />
had somehow gone unnoticed through the whole battle) head-first.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm goin' after her,&quot; Amaroq said with determination.  With a
<br />
whoop, he jumped in after her, forgetting that he was supposed to be resting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They fell a few floors, then found their target.  Kate, using the
<br />
power of the Chaos Emeralds, and Amaroq, using the Moon Gems, stopped and
<br />
floated in mid-air, listening.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, what the who-ha happened?&quot; came a groggy voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jade checked her watch.  &quot;You've been unconscious for 7 minutes,
<br />
rabbit,&quot; she observed.  &quot;I liked you better that way.  I don't want to risk
<br />
having you grab me again, so I guess I'll just put up a barrier around
<br />
me...and Maxl!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie, whose head had cleared, rushed toward Jade.  She ran to a
<br />
spot a few feet away from the badgers, and bounced back to her original position.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No use,&quot; Kabuki said grimly.  &quot;Looks like our only choice is to
<br />
stand here and watch.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly!&quot; Jade said gleefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK!&quot;  The cry came from three voices: Amaroq
<br />
and Kate, as well as a hedgehog who had been hidden in the shadows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using their combined powers, the three sapped away Jade's
<br />
force-field's energy in a nanosecond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Jig's up,&quot; Amaroq growled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give yourself up,&quot; Kate said, &quot;if you value your existence.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie opened her mouth to say something, but in a quick movement,
<br />
Jade reached for her boot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maxl!  Move it!&quot; Hedgehog X shouted.  &quot;She's got a...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knife,&quot; Jade finished for him, pressing the steel against Maxl's
<br />
neck.  &quot;Now, you shall all watch as I kill him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute!&quot; Kabuki said.  &quot;You, him, and Tracker are all
<br />
connected...if you kill him, you'll kill yourself!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's possible,&quot; Jade acknowledged, &quot;but frankly, I just don't
<br />
care!&quot;  She turned to Maxl.  &quot;Any last requests, weakling?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ummm, yeah,&quot; Maxl said.  &quot;Got any meatloaf?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; Jade replied.  &quot;Anything else?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well...my allergies have really been botherin' me lately,&quot; Maxl
<br />
said.  &quot;Mind if I blow my nose?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You could use it,&quot; Jade acknowledged.  &quot;All right, here's a hank
<br />
-- EWWW!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl had blown his nose all over the sleeve of his dirty shirt.
<br />
The others in the room were all grimacing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, you disgusting little...&quot; Jade suddenly broke off and started
<br />
screaming.  Her appearance started to distort, so that her face looked like
<br />
it was being pressed against a glass door, and the rest of her was
<br />
beginning to dissolve.  Within seconds, she wasn't there anymore.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some time, no-one spoke.  Finally, Maxl was the one to break
<br />
the silence.  &quot;Whoa,&quot; he gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I second that,&quot; HX replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like my nasal discharge somehow displaced Jade into another
<br />
dimension,&quot; Maxl mused, stroking the hair on his chin tentatively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The others gaped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How did you suddenly get so SMART?!&quot; Amaroq asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And what the who-ha happened to yo' funny accent?&quot; Bunnie wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I may answer both questions at once,&quot; Maxl said, &quot;Jade's very
<br />
existence in the same world as I am causes me to go berserk.  Luckily, now
<br />
that she's gone, I'm back to my normal self.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not the comic relief anymore, eh?&quot; came a voice from above.  The
<br />
group looked up through the hole in the ceiling and saw X peering down at
<br />
them.  &quot;Let's get back to the Hidden Palace,&quot; he said.
<br />
<br /><br />CHAPTER 12
<br />
HOME AGAIN
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Interesting story,&quot; Bookshire said.  As usual, he had stayed
<br />
behind and monitored the others.  Between his age and his weak right leg,
<br />
one could say battle was not Bookshire Draftwood's strong suit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You sound like you would be a very worthy asset,&quot; Sally said to
<br />
Maxl.  &quot;Will you join the Freedom Fighters?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Maxl said, &quot;the thing is, I don't really know how to use my
<br />
powers all that well.  I think it's best that I learn some more about them
<br />
before I join you for good, so that I don't end up setting any of you on
<br />
fire or anything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X nodded.  &quot;Understandable.  However, I'd like to keep in touch, if
<br />
possible.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; Maxl said.  &quot;Uhhh, how?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me see your watch for a bit,&quot; Rotor said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Planning on installing a wrist communicator?&quot; Maxl inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mmm-hmm,&quot; Rotor replied, taking the watch.  He grabbed some parts
<br />
and tinkered with them for a few minutes, and handed Maxl his watch back,
<br />
this time with a small microphone and speaker installed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; Maxl said, grinning.  &quot;Also, do you have any clean shirts
<br />
or shorts?&quot;  He pointed down at his garments, which were covered in dust,
<br />
grime, and all sorts of stuff that I can't describe and you wouldn't want
<br />
to hear about anyway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Sally said, &quot;I've got a spare vest...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; Maxl replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have ze whole wardrobe,&quot; Antoine spoke up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess I'll check that out too,&quot; Maxl said, trying to be polite.
<br />
He and Antoine walked off, and Sally went to get her spare vest.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maxl came out a few minutes later in a uniform like Antoine's.
<br />
&quot;Well, it's an improvement over what I had before,&quot; he said.  He looked
<br />
down at the scabbard in the belt Antoine had given him.  &quot;Hmmm,&quot; he
<br />
muttered, &quot;I don't have anything to put in here...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take a katana,&quot; Kabuki said.  She handed him the blade she'd been
<br />
using.  &quot;I have others.  This should last you until you gain mastery of
<br />
your powers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll fly you to the Great Forest in ANT 100,&quot; X offered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; Maxl said.  &quot;Thanks, everybody, for all you've
<br />
done...especially you, Kabuki.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X and Maxl headed out, and flew off to the almost-vacant Great
<br />
Forest.  X landed in what looked like a likely spot, then let his passenger
<br />
go.  The two waved goodbye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Smiling, the badger walked off into the forest, thinking of what
<br />
good friends he'd met.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, Maxl checked his watch.
