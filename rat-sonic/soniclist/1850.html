I'll remove my correspondent's address to protect the innocent/guilty and 
<br />
so you can flame me for this being off-topic, but I thought it might be of
<br />
interest...
<br />

<br />
The only comment I'll make is that as long as these &quot;other inert gases&quot; 
<br />
aren't things like chlorine, carbon monoxide, or hydrogen sulfide (none of 
<br />
which are really inert :^)), then I don't know what would be dangerous 
<br />
about inhaling party helium (but don't sue me if you do and it kills you :^))

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's some trivia for you all: according to the parade hosts, Sonic was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the second largest (in terms of helium used) balloon in the parade 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Garfield was first), and Macy's parade is the second biggest user of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;helium in the country (world?) - the US government is first.
</em><br />

<br />
Additional trivia...the entire stock of helium in the US is under control
<br />
of the US government.  This was done right after WWI, as airships (balloons
<br />
and dirigibles) had played such an important part in the previous skirmish.
<br />
In particular, Germany was denied access to all helium stores in the world.
<br />
Thus, to run their growing airship industry, Germany turned to hydrogen
<br />
gas, which could be manufactured very simply and in mass quantities.
<br />

<br />
Of course, the problem with hydrogen is that it is highly combustible...and
<br />
led to the destruction of the Hindenberg as it was landing in New Jersey.
<br />
While there are numerous rumors, the accepted trigger was a static electric
<br />
discharge that traveled along one of the many mooring ropes trailing from
<br />
the ship.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Trivia item #2 - the helium used to inflate the common party balloon, as
<br />
you see from many restaurants and other stores, is not 100% pure helium.
<br />
It's my understanding that it's only about 70% helium, with other inert
<br />
gases.  And it's also a good reason not to breathe &quot;balloon&quot; helium.  Yes,
<br />
the helium is inert, and makes you sound funny...but you don't know what
<br />
those other gases in there could be.  I don't know about the Macy's Parade 
<br />
balloons, whether they use pure helium or the 'balloon' helium.
