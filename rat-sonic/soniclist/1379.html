<br />Part 2
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The group was soon back home in Knothole, and they all went to Sally's hut 
<br />
to congratulate each other, and to become acquainted with Knothole's newcomer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd's spirits had lifted when he entered Knothole, and he was looking 
<br />
excitedly around, taking it all in.  He still wasn't saying much, though, and 
<br />
Sally decided to prompt him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, tell us about yourself, Todd,&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd looked at her and shrugged, saying, &quot;I've just always wanted to find 
<br />
this place and meet you all.  I've heard a lot about you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled.  &quot;Well thank you, Todd, but that doesn't tell us much about 
<br />
you.  Where are you from?  How did you know about us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sonic chimed in, &quot;and what were you doing all alone back in 
<br />
Robo-ville?  That's not a way to easy living, you know!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd sighed and looked away from them.  &quot;It's a long story.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  We got time,&quot; Sonic said, and the others nodded in agreement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd turned around, his face looking weary, having lost some of the 
<br />
enthusiasm.  &quot;Okay.&quot;  He looked for a place to sit, and did so.  &quot;Should I start
<br />
at the beginning?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's usually the best place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd nodded.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I used to live in a small village close to the edge of the Great Forest, 
<br />
north of what I guess used to be Mobotropolis.  It was just me and my mother, 
<br />
because my father had disappeared when I was real young.  I don't really 
<br />
remember too much about it, I just know that I was happy and my Mom loved me.  
<br />
And then...that day...it was my sixth birthday, no less...&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd's mind went back to that fateful day nearly a decade ago: the day of 
<br />
the coup.  After taking over the city, Robotnik's forces, with Packbell in 
<br />
command, quickly spread all over the northern continent, enslaving the 
<br />
populations of every city and village they could find.  It was Packbell himself 
<br />
who had seen to the areas surrounding Mobotropolis, including the Great Forest, 
<br />
and Todd's village...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cammy held her young son close to her.  She, her son, and the rest of the 
<br />
villagers (those who had survived the raid) were in a hovercraft, being taken to
<br />
somewhere in the newly rechristened Robotropolis.  There was no sound, save the 
<br />
whine of the hovercraft's motors and the occasional sob from somewhere within.  
<br />
The raid had been very quick, and in under ten minutes all the villagers had 
<br />
either been forced into the hovercraft, or were dead.  Now, they were being 
<br />
taken away, and none of them had any idea where.  Cammy cradled her son, trying 
<br />
to shield him from the fear that was tearing her apart.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd, having no idea what was going on, buried himself in his mother's 
<br />
chest fur, not wanting to look out.  What was supposed to be a day of 
<br />
celebration for him had turned upside down, and now, all he felt was fear.  He 
<br />
cried, and Cammy held him tighter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, the hovercraft stopped, and the villagers were hoarded out of 
<br />
it and soon found themselves in a wide open room, housing nothing but a raised 
<br />
podium.  There they were made to wait, as if dared to imagine what their unknown
<br />
fates were.  And then, Dr. Ivo Robotnik and his android commander entered the 
<br />
room.  Robotnik stepped up to the podium and Packbell stood by his side, laser 
<br />
rifle in hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Citizens of Mobius,&quot; Robotnik began, &quot;I am sure you are all quite confused
<br />
and curious about what is going on here.&quot;  He chuckled.  &quot;It is all very simple 
<br />
really.  I, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, formerly known to you all as Julian, Minister of 
<br />
War, have decided that his majesty King Acorn is unworthy to rule, and therefore
<br />
I have...persuaded him to step down and allow me to take his place.  Now, what 
<br />
does this mean to you all?&quot;  He paused, looking around at the frightened faces, 
<br />
grinning with evil pleasure.  &quot;I am pleased to tell you that your lives will 
<br />
become much easier to live.  No longer will you be burdened with the uncertainty
<br />
of deciding what to do with yourselves.  Gone will be the regrets of having 
<br />
taken the wrong steps in life.   Thanks to modern technology, something that 
<br />
King Acorn never had an appropriate appreciaton for, you will be sent through a 
<br />
process called 'roboticization', where you will become living robots, existing 
<br />
only to serve my purposes.&quot;  Robotnik could still see fear in the faces in the 
<br />
room, but he also noticed disbelief and anger in a few as well.  That will 
<br />
change, he thought.  &quot;Perhaps some of you have not heard about the work of Sir 
<br />
Charles Hedgehog and do not believe that such a thing is possible.  In that 
<br />
case, let us go ahead and demonstrate this remarkable technology to you all.  
<br />
Packbell.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The android nodded in reply, and motioned to the Swat-Bots at the edge of 
<br />
the room.  Soon, the crowd was escorted out of the room and deeper into the 
<br />
building, finally coming to a room not quite as big as the one before, dominated
<br />
by machinery surrounding a huge glass cylinder.  Robotnik rubbed his hands 
<br />
together in gleeful anticipation.  &quot;Now, citizens, who wants to be the first 
<br />
volunteer?&quot;  His eyes slowly scanned the room, finally resting on a trembling 
<br />
female squirrel near the far edge of the crowd.  &quot;You.  Swat-Bots, bring her 
<br />
here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young squirrel shrieked in terror, but Robotnik seemed deaf to it as 
<br />
the Swat-Bots literally dragged her from the crowd up to the glass cylinder.  
<br />
Robotnik pressed a button, and the cylinder slowly raised, allowing the 
<br />
Swat-Bots to place her on the pad the cylinder had surrounded.  Before she could
<br />
react, the cylinder slid down again, imprisoning her inside, her screams no 
<br />
longer heard outside the encasement.  Robotnik pressed another button, and a 
<br />
steady whine gradually increased in volume.  The roboticizer was charging.  
<br />
&quot;Now,&quot; he said slowly, deeply, &quot;watch carefully.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The crowd was taken completely by surprise as the squirrel was suddenly 
<br />
engulfed in a searing yellow light, and they gasped in horror as she transformed
<br />
right before their eyes.  Fur and skin became metal.  Eyes glowed red.  Her 
<br />
arms, which had been pounding against the cylinder in panic, ceased their 
<br />
movement and hung loosely at her sides.  Finally, it was over, and the cylinder 
<br />
slid up again, revealing a robot where a living squirrel had once been.  
<br />
Somebody screamed.  Somebody else fainted.  Cammy clutched Todd even tighter, a 
<br />
tear wetting her cheek fur.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik only smiled.  &quot;The process is a quick one, as you see, and it is 
<br />
not specific to gender, age, or species.  Remarkable, is it not?  Now, who will 
<br />
be next?&quot;  Once again he made a point of looking around slowly, until finally he
<br />
chose a male fox, not much older than a kit, being held in his mother's arms.  
<br />
&quot;You.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO!!&quot; Cammy screamed, holding Todd away from the Swat-Bots' reach.  &quot;I 
<br />
won't let you!  He's just a child!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik slowly walked over to her and glared, emphasizing every syllable 
<br />
as he stated, &quot;There is nothing to gain from resistance, for you will be 
<br />
roboticized as well.  Now.  Give - him - to - me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cammy shouted her denial again and then, in her panic and anger, the 
<br />
vulpine instincts of her ancestors took over, and she clamped her muzzle down on
<br />
Robotnik's arm.  Todd fell out of her arms and quickly ran behind her, only to 
<br />
be roughly picked up and held by the Swat-Bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik howled in pain and surprise, but Packbell was swift, rushing over 
<br />
and forcefully removing her from his arm.  Robotnik doubled over, his other arm 
<br />
clutching the wound in an attempt to stop the bleeding.  But then, he looked 
<br />
back up, and slowly began walking over to where Packbell was holding her.  He 
<br />
stopped in front of her, doing nothing but glaring at her for one long minute.  
<br />
Then, he seized her out of Packbell's grasp, one hand getting a firm grip on her
<br />
neck.  He turned and looked at Todd.  &quot;Say goodbye, young fox.&quot;  Anger burned in
<br />
his eyes as he tightened his grip until...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*SNAP*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;MOMMY!!&quot;  Todd cried out.  He struggled against the Swat-Bots and somehow 
<br />
found himself freed from their clutches.  Todd wanted to run to his mother, but 
<br />
in one quick second he looked at her, he looked up at Robotnik, and something 
<br />
inside him took over.  He found himself bolting for the doorway, running as fast
<br />
as he could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost instantly Packbell had the laser rifle aimed, but before he could 
<br />
fire, Robotnik pushed it down.  &quot;Let him go,&quot; he said.  &quot;He will learn his 
<br />
lesson soon enough.  He'll never make it out of the city alive.&quot;  He dropped 
<br />
Cammy's lifeless body to the floor, and glared at the remainder of the crowd.  
<br />
&quot;Packbell, see to it that the rest of these prisoners are processed smoothly, 
<br />
using any means necessary.  Swat-Bots,&quot; he pointed to Cammy, &quot;see to that.&quot;  He 
<br />
turned and walked out of the room, holding his wounded arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik had been wrong.  Todd, by nothing short of a miracle, had managed 
<br />
to find his way out of Robotropolis.  It was a small victory, however.  He was 
<br />
now completely on his own, and he had not the slightest idea where he could go 
<br />
or even what he needed to do to stay alive...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd paused.  It was difficult to continue.  &quot;I don't remember what 
<br />
happened right after that too well.  I was in the Great Unknown somewhere, 
<br />
half-dead when I was found by a group of travellers also escaping Robotnik.  I 
<br />
was with them for several years after that, as we wandered all over, trying to 
<br />
stay away from the patrols.  One of them, a wolf named Sebastian, was a master 
<br />
of many martial arts, and the others had looked to him as their leader.  He 
<br />
liked me and trained me to fight.  We lived as best we could, hiding where we 
<br />
could, and constantly moving so Robotnik wouldn't be able to trap us.  And then 
<br />
one day, a few months ago, we met up with another group of travellers.  They had
<br />
a storyteller with them, and that night we all sat around a fire listening to 
<br />
him.  One of his stories was about a village somewhere in the Great Forest, 
<br />
where a hedgehog who could move faster than sound led a group of animals in 
<br />
fights against Robotnik.&quot;  Todd smiled.  &quot;You guys.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa!&quot; Sonic said.  &quot;Ya hear that, Sal?  They're already writing stories 
<br />
about us!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally merely rolled her eyes, chuckling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd continued.  &quot;Soon after that I decided to leave, and I found my way 
<br />
back to the Great Forest.  I wanted to find you guys, to meet those who were 
<br />
actually putting up a fight against Robotnik, and maybe...&quot;  His voice trailed 
<br />
off, but that look of hope was again in his eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was pretty sure what he was about to say, but there was still one 
<br />
unanswered question.  &quot;So, Todd, what were you doing in Robotropolis?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd looked down.  &quot;I had wandered all over the Great Forest looking for 
<br />
this place, but I never found it.  And then, this morning, I found myself near 
<br />
the edge of the forest, looking at the city.  I thought about what Robotnik did 
<br />
to my mother...&quot;  He hesitated.  &quot;I just wanted to find something, anything I 
<br />
could do to hurt him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally shook her head.  &quot;You wouldn't be able to do anything, alone like 
<br />
that.  You're very lucky you weren't captured and roboticized.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd shrugged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic tried to cheer him up.  &quot;Well, you're here now, bud!  Come on, we're 
<br />
gonna have us a party tonight!&quot;  He turned to the others and threw his fist in 
<br />
the air.  &quot;We did it!&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night, the Freedom Fighters and most of the villagers sat around a 
<br />
campfire.  Sonic was telling the story of their mission with his usual bravado, 
<br />
receiving gasps of astonishment from many, as well as the occasional snicker 
<br />
from those who had been with him.  Todd was there as well, and he had been 
<br />
introduced to many of Knothole's residents, and his spirits were high.  He had 
<br />
finally found Knothole.  Did he finally have a place to call home?  More 
<br />
importantly, he thought:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will I finally be able to pay Robotnik back?
<br />
<br />To be continued.
