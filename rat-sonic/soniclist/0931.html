On with the Summary:
<br />

<br />
A while back I said I wasn't much of an art critic since I thought all the
<br />
artists did a fine job.. however I have to say I like the way Knuckles was 
<br />
drawn much better in &quot;Panic in the Sky&quot; over the other two stories.  I think
<br />
its in the way his eyes were drawn.
<br />

-- Panic in the Sky! --
<br />
&nbsp;[ Part 1 ]
<br />
The approach of a floating island disrupts the people on the western coast 
<br />
of the &quot;Great Continent&quot;*.  Back at Knothole, Sally and the crew hear of 
<br />
these reports and see the island is heading straight for Knothole**.  Sonic
<br />
walks in with Tails and tell the others its the Floating Island they were 
<br />
on a few months back*** where they met Knuckles the Echinda.
<br />

<br />
They head out in their TurboProp**** flown by Antoine to investigate the
<br />
island and why its come to Knothole.  On the way there they're nearly shot
<br />
down by guns mounted on the bottom.  The guns are avoided by flying above
<br />
the island's horison and Sonic parachutes (while Tails just flies) down to
<br />
land.
<br />

<br />
They see Brobdignagian*5* fungi [Giant Mushrooms] and have to avoid a few
<br />
hazards (pendulums and ax-weilding bots) but Sonic falls into a trap where
<br />
he once again sees Knuckles.
<br />

<br />
[Part 2]
<br />

<br />
Sonic is hanging onto the side of a cliff while Knuckles is about to step
<br />
on his fingers since this is Sonic's second trespassing offense.  Tails
<br />
saves the day (sorta) by trying to drop a rock on Knuckles from above.. this
<br />
sends both down the edge of the clif and nearly into dangerous waters.
<br />
Tails eventually airlifts both of them*6* to safety.  Knuckles grudgingly
<br />
thanks Tails and Sonic explains that the island's been 'hijacked'.
<br />

<br />
Knuckles takes Sonic and Tails down to the Chaos Chamber (where the Chaos
<br />
Emerald which holds up the island resides).  They see its energy is being
<br />
syphoned by none other than Robotnik himself!
<br />

<br />
Robotnik reveals his plan (since its too late to stop him*7*).  He burrowed
<br />
in from the underside of the island and added thrusters and weapons.  He'd
<br />
use it as a flying fortress and use energy from the Chaos Emerald to power 
<br />
weapons ment to wipe out the freedom fighters.
<br />

<br />
Knuckles, as guardian of the island can't allow his island to be used this
<br />
way and decides to smash the Chaos Emerald.  With the island falling 
<br />
Robotnik makes a hasty retreat... he thinks he still won since the island
<br />
is about to crush Knothole*8*.  Knuckles breaks out a spare*9* emerald and
<br />
replaces it in time.
<br />

<br />
Sonic asks Knuckles if he'd like to land the island and join the Freedom
<br />
Fighters.  Knuckles declines saying he has his own problems and responsi-
<br />
bilities and takes the island away so he can remove Robotnik's weapons.
<br />

<br />

<br />
{{
<br />
Lots of Footnotes:
<br />

<br />
* They give the impression Arlo, Penelope, Hamlin and Dylan (i.e. Freedom
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighters from Princess Sally Miniseries) live here.
<br />

<br />
** This is weird.  The freedom fighter's headquarters is looking alot like 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's place.. suprisingly high-tech for a rebel underground.
<br />

<br />
*** Sonic and Tails say they were on the island months ago... You mean after
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;all this time they didn't tell anyone?
<br />

<br />
**** I've never been much on military markings but doesn't that plane have
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. WWII markings.. maybe its their way of celebrating V.E day 50th aniv.
<br />

<br />
*5* What's &quot;Brobdignagian&quot; mean you ask?  Brobdignag?..  Jonathan Swift?.. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Gulliver's travels!?... READ A BOOK DAMMIT! -- READ A BOOK!
<br />

<br />
*6* He's lifting two guys bigger than he is?  Tails is going to need some
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;BenGay for his rump after that one.
<br />

<br />
*7* That's what all evil villans say :)
<br />

<br />
*8* It looks like Robotnik knows where Knothole is... Also, there are alot
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;of visible huts in what used to be an 'underground village'.
<br />

<br />
*9* Knuckles later says it wasn't a spare.. he swapped emeralds, broke a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'fake' one and replaced the real one.  There's really was no reason for 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;him to tell Sonic he had a 'spare' emerald since Robotnik had already 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;left...  He could've just told him he swapped emeralds right then and 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;there.  (Or he could've just stuck to his lie).
<br />

<br />

<br />
-- Fire Drill --
<br />

<br />
Knuckles hears a loud 'KA-THOOOM!' from near the beach and he flies over to
<br />
investigate.  He spots the intruder in some bushes but its gone when he 
<br />
jumps it.  He suspects its Sonic since whoever it is MUST be very fast.
<br />

<br />
Knuckles follows the trail around to places on the island even HE doesn't 
<br />
know about (apparently his father never revealed ALL of the island's secrets).
<br />

<br />
The trail eventually leads off the edge of the island.  Knuckles still thinks
<br />
it was Sonic up to no good... &quot;Good riddence (just wait'll next time)&quot;
<br />

<br />
[ In the last panel we see that the invader is still on the island.  Only
<br />
the shadow of a hand is shown as he says to himself... &quot;This was only your 
<br />
first lesson and I can see already you have a lot to learn!  Class is now 
<br />
in session...&quot; ]
<br />

<br />
{{ I have no idea who this mysterious person is.. the arm looks too skinny
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be Robotnik's though.  maybe a Chaotix character..  maybe Nack the 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weasel.  I can't say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked this story... it had a mysterious feel to it. }}
<br />

<br />

<br />
-- Lord of the Floating Island --
<br />

<br />
We see Knuckles patroling the floating island on an unusually windy day 
<br />
when he spots a confused baby kangaroo.  He lands to keep the joey company
<br />
while they search for mom.  Bengy (we find out his name later) knows 
<br />
Knuckles watches over the island and asks him to bring back the sky.
<br />
[Its unusually dark during the day.. yet there are few clouds].  Knukles 
<br />
explains that what's happening is an 'eclipse' and that's probably whats
<br />
causing the unusual winds. 
<br />

<br />
After avoiding a herd of (biped) dingoes Knuckles explains a bit more about
<br />
the island to Bengy... how its a paradise yet there's been visitors who'd
<br />
like to change that [namely Sonic and Robotnik].
<br />

<br />
As the eclipse ends and the winds die down they meet up with Bengy's mom.
<br />
Knuckles flies off..  &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect and serve!&quot;
<br />

<br />
{{ There really wan't a whole lot too this story.  All it really shows
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is that Knuckles isn't really such a bad guy after all. }}
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
{{ My note:  Archie Comic's 'On Sale' dates tend to be faithful (or try to 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be) but the dates put on the issues tend to be 'two months early' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[i.e. Sonic #24 is the July issue but came out in May]  I guess this
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gives them some 'breathing room' in case something crops up.. e.g the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;last minutes &quot;Princess Sally Miniseries&quot; changes }}
