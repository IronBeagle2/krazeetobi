&nbsp;The Saturday morning Sonic series basically blows away any other 
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;attempts at US videogame cartoons. Lets face it, the Super Mario 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bros. Super Show was really lame.
</em><br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that the Sonic show had some really great things going for it,
<br />
which no other cartoon studios seem to have latched on to. Sonic had a
<br />
really great plot going for it. that's probably because they didn't just
<br />
stay true to the games. I mean, how many characters from the show were
<br />
actually in games? 2 or 3? The attitude that cartoon spinoffs have to remain
<br />
&quot;pure&quot; doesn't really make sense. The Super mario Brothers cartoons were
<br />
pretty lame because the same thing happened every episode; i.e. what
<br />
happened in the games. 1) Koopa kidnaps Princess.(Surprise!) 2) Mario
<br />
Brothers Attempt rescue (*Gasp!* Can they do it?) 3) Princess is
<br />
rescued,(Whew! That was a close one.) 4) Show ends, see ya tomorrow. SMB
<br />
isn't the only example of this kind of failure, so why do cartoon studios
<br />
continue to turn out this trite and boring material? (Somebody already
<br />
brought this up. The answer is $$$MONEY$$$)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The creative team for Sonic actually tried to be original. New
<br />
characters, new ideas, and most importantly, they tried to develop the
<br />
characters' personalities. During each show, we learned more about what
<br />
makes them tick. They became more familiar and easier to relate to. On the
<br />
other hand, most other cartoon characters remain static and really
<br />
unrealistic. It seems like many writers don't give kids enough credit. I
<br />
really think that an 8 year old can grasp the concept of someone having a
<br />
personality. I was around 9 or 10 when the Super Mario Brothers were on, and
<br />
I didn't like it. It was too predictable. I've found that most of the stuff
<br />
that's on Saturday mornings now isn't even worth watching. Too bad. The
<br />
Sonic show was an oasis in a desert of boring television. If they brought
<br />
the show back, I would be really happy. Unfortunately, I think we can safely
<br />
say that it isn't going to happen. :( 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's always reruns... :)
<br />

<br />
Later...
<br />
