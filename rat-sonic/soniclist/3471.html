<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It is ridiculous for you to assume that I owe you this service. Lack of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; appreciation like this makes me wish I had shut it down sooner. Though I can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; only hope you and your attitude is in the minority.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Rat, let's be sensable: the government, (for example,) doesn't OWE us 
</em><br />

<br />
Yes, the government owes us. But I guess you don't pay taxes yet. Would you
<br />
like to pay me taxes? If you paid me, and I didn't follow through on the
<br />
agreement, then you would have reason to bitch. Otherwise, shut the hell up.
<br />
I'm sick of hearing this.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; It doesn't matter anyway since the list is going away soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You don't seem to care.
</em><br />

<br />
It's pointless to try to enforce list policy when there is about to be no
<br />
list. And I do care, otherwise I would have just shut the list down without
<br />
warning. Ever consider that?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; You always (have had) this chip on your shoulder.  Mind explaining why?
</em><br />

<br />
It just upsets me when people forget that this is a free service that I am
<br />
providing, and refuse to respect that. People still post binaries and fan
<br />
fiction regardless of how much I bitched about it. And I get &quot;how dare that
<br />
mean ratman tell me not to do this&quot;.
<br />

<br />
The reaction to me shutting the list down makes me even more bitter. I don't
<br />
owe any of you anything. And after seeing some of the flames and personal
<br />
attacks against me, I wish I had known about those people so I could have
<br />
banned them from the list sooner. As much as people don't like the fact, this
<br />
list is on MY server, and if people don't like it, they can get the hell out.
<br />
I don't have to explain why, it is my decision. This is not a democracy.  For
<br />
example, if EVERYONE wrote me and said they wanted fanfic to be permitted to
<br />
be posted, do you think I would allow it? I don't think so. But this is all a
<br />
moot point since this list will be no more. 
<br />

<br />
The upside to this, is nobody HAS TO be here. If everyone hated the way I 
<br />
ran things, someone else could make their own mailing list, and everyone 
<br />
would join that.
<br />

<br />
But I'll try not to let the flames get me down, I did see a few nice
<br />
thank-you's from people. I do appreciate it.
<br />

<br />
So to people that said thank you, I say &quot;I appreciate it, and you're
<br />
welcome&quot;, and I'm sorry to see you go.
<br />

<br />
And to those freeloading scum, I say, &quot;I wish you had shown your true colors
<br />
before so I could have kicked your ungrateful ass off.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Note I have unsubscribed hk512_at_cleveland.freenet.edu since I don't feel like
<br />
reading any other posts by him.
<br />

<br />
And I'd like to thank Erich, who was the real list admin. I owned the list,
<br />
but I asked him to run it, which he did. His job was to be the person behind
<br />
owner-sonic_at_lists.mv.net that people could ask questions to. Also he had the
<br />
dredded task of unsubscribing invalid email addresses.
