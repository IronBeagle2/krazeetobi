</em><br />

<br />
To be posted on the AOL Sonic Bullitin Boards and the
<br />
Sonic Mailing List....
<br />

<br />
As things like this often do, there were some errors
<br />
I made in Blood and Metal after I actually posted them,
<br />
dealing with chara design, credits given, and what not.
<br />
Being someone who wants to give a story that's as 
<br />
contunity sound as possible, I've given three of my
<br />
seven chapters revisions that are listed below:
<br />

<br />
1)  The entire story line will be re-titled, &quot;Blood
<br />
and Metal Alpha.&quot;  This is because BAM will be a
<br />
contuning story, and will be broken off into &quot;books&quot;
<br />
denoted by greek letter (for now).  BAM Beta will begin
<br />
in December and will introduce a new &quot;Wild Pack&quot; chara,
<br />
as well as a &quot;Wild Pack&quot; deiety who takes a liking to
<br />
Mr. Crockett.
<br />

<br />
2)  Davey was in error when he first saw Bear.  To the
<br />
normal Mobian, according to Daniel Davis' chara design,
<br />
Bear (in fox mode) looks like an 25 year old brown fox.
<br />
Davey looked in those Deep Blue pools that Bear has for
<br />
eyes, and saw him as somewhat older, wiser, and grayer.
<br />
It could be that Davey inadvertingly saw the Hermit
<br />
side of Bear, but Davey doesn't know about the Hermit
<br />
yat and wasn't sure; he just filed it away into cold
<br />
storage for later.  In BAM ALPHA, chapter II, I altered
<br />
the storyline to include this scene and get Bear's 
<br />
description straight.
<br />

<br />
3)  Also with Bear, in BAM ALPHA VII, I've got the credit
<br />
wrong.  Silly Phracking Me.  So I corrected it.
<br />

<br />
4)  I noticed that, in a still shot from the Saturday Cartoon
<br />
Series, King Acorn is a fox!  Since I wanted BAM to be the
<br />
continuation of that series, I had to hake that adjustment.
<br />

<br />
What I do with these revisions is place them in my WWW Page
<br />
[<a href="http://users.aol.com/dgonterman">http://users.aol.com/dgonterman</a>] and put a blinking 
<br />
&quot;Revised&quot; next to them.  I will also exit the Deluxe Editions
<br />
accordingly, if Ratman will allow me to upload the corrected
<br />
version of BAM ALPHA I DELUXE into his web page.  I do not
<br />
know if Tooner will let me replace the chapters in the 
<br />
Archives with these updated ones, but I'll assume that you
<br />
have already got them all, and can just download the upgrade
<br />
from my WWW Page.
<br />

<br />
I also tried to answer, a little bit incorectly, about what
<br />
the treated bodies from Davey's modified Roboticizer is made
<br />
of.. Symon Kielb asked if they were organic.  I answered that
<br />
they were a Bio-Genetic Polly-Alloy.  I got the Bio-Genetic
<br />
right, but the new bodies are certainly not metallic, as &quot;Polly-
<br />
Alloy&quot; would have you believe.  This will teach me never to 
<br />
answer E-Mail at 11 P.M, trying to answer something I'm trying
<br />
to figure out myself.  What I wanted to say that the 
<br />
new flesh is not their original bodies, but artificially made
<br />
from the Roboticizing over what is already Roboticized.  That
<br />
can be why Bunnie can switch from Flesh to Metal at will.  Note
<br />
to Detail Mongers:  The modifications done to the Roboticizer
<br />
had the Feedback Loop (Which occurs when Roboticizer meets Robot,
<br />
as in Princess Sally #3) in mind and took steps to advoid it.
<br />
How, I have no idea.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your cooperation as I give my stories some
<br />
&quot;Home Improvement&quot;....har, har, har
