To Dan:
<br />

<br />
Feel free to express your comments and criticisms whenever you like. I think
<br />
some of it is valid and other parts uninformed. However, lots of other people
<br />
aren't aware of what goes on in the production of the comic series unless
<br />
they're one of the few involved, so I understand when the comment made is
<br />
such. The problem is I don't have the time to always correct the record. I
<br />
accept this, don't get offended when you don't like something, and try to
<br />
make my next story better than the last.
<br />

<br />
One thing that makes writing SONIC (and Archie titles in general) harder than
<br />
say, your average super-hero title, is that we CAN'T do continued stories
<br />
whenever we like. Most stories have to fit in whatever page count we're
<br />
alloted, whether it's 8, 11, 16 or 24 pages. The writers don't have the
<br />
luxury of being able to prolong the action like you see in your average DC or
<br />
Marvel comic where one story can take up to half a year or more worth of
<br />
issues. 
<br />

<br />
The writers also sometimes have to jettison a story they'd rather work on in
<br />
favor of one the editor or a SEGA representative wants to see done, because
<br />
that is the direction they want the book to go in. The writer may make
<br />
suggestions, and if it's a good day, hopefully the editor will be receptive.
<br />
(In most cases, they usually are.)
<br />

<br />
That the PRINCESS SALLY mini-series came out at all is a minor miracle. Not
<br />
quite on the level of the Beatles reuniting, but close. Scott was pulling his
<br />
hair out during the entire process doing his best to keep things moving
<br />
along. In fairness to the people at SEGA, they wanted to create a viable
<br />
environment where the public would be anticipating more PRINCESS SALLY
<br />
products such as a her own video-game or line of t-shirts or whatever, and
<br />
the comic series represented the beginning of that, so it was important to
<br />
them that it was done the best it could be. The sad part was fan reaction was
<br />
VERY positive, but poor distribution resulted in poor sales. I'd still like
<br />
to do another SALLY mini-series.
<br />

<br />
Regarding browsing any SONIC fan fiction, I'm afraid I won't be reading any
<br />
until I'm no longer working on SONIC. We already have a game plan mapped out
<br />
for the forseeable future, and if I use something somebody has already
<br />
written, I run the risk of appearing to have borrowed from another writer's
<br />
ideas. My apologies for this policy, but I hope you understand. Thanks for
<br />
your interest.
<br />
