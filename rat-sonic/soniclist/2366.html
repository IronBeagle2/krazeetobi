---Ahem----
<br />

<br />
As I was typing this article out, I was noticing that the majority of the
<br />
internet are now dressed in black, as it were.  They are currently in morning
<br />
over the fact that Satan's child, a.k.a. Bill Clinton, who may be defiling
<br />
the oval office with his presence but was never and will never be my
<br />
president, (Rush Limbaugh is, you damn fools!!!) has signed the
<br />
Telecomunications Bill that makes cybersmut a crime and demands Violence
<br />
Chips on TVs.  You might think that I'm joining in on this &quot;party,&quot; because
<br />
some of my pages are black, expecially the ones with the big pictures of my
<br />
artwork on it.
<br />

<br />
They are *not* black for the above reason.  They are black so you can see the
<br />
pics better.  No other.
<br />

<br />
I find myself IN FAVOR of *somebody* controlling the availability of material
<br />
hazordous to minors on the Net (That's *smut* you dumb_at_$$!!), because I
<br />
believe that there is just too much Sexual Material crammed into their lives
<br />
all at once.  Whatever happening to having fun, just making friends, and
<br />
getting to *know* your net.lover before you go to the back seat of your
<br />
486DX2-66?  Surely Nodoby on the net will pass a law to outlaw *that*!!!  I
<br />
will discuss this further later on in American Kitsune.
<br />

<br />
I would like to assure to my little rest stop on the Information Superhighway
<br />
and the Telecomuniation Bill *will not in any way* affect this page.  I do
<br />
not allow such crap to even touch my page, and therefore do not have anything
<br />
for whoever's playing net.police raise a stink about.  The same goes for
<br />
rat.org, now that the hentai ('Perverts' to those who aren't in Anime)
<br />
department was removed, half a year before this Bill.  The same goes for the
<br />
remainer of the Sonic Pages.  We're not www.playboy.com here.  We're just a
<br />
bunch of guys and gals discussing a Video Game universe for Pete's Sake!  And
<br />
In a network the size of the entire cosmos, to boot!!  You think that anyone
<br />
outside our little world *cares*?  I don't.
<br />

<br />
The average Joe Cyberjock will not be affected by the Telecommunications bill
<br />
which is trying to keep NC-36 rated crap from people who don't need it in
<br />
their lives.  All this laments of censorship is just hysterical parinoia
<br />
brought on by pinko commie liberals with tiny minds who think primarily with
<br />
their penises.  They can have their little pics of doing dogs and naked ugly
<br />
performance artists with a bullwhip in their anus.  I just don't want them,
<br />
and the same goes for most of my fans!!!  That's all.  The Net is NOT dead!!
<br />
&nbsp;Long live the Net!!!   And The FoxFire Studios will still be trucking down
<br />
the Information Superhighway, no matter *what* Exon will think about it.
<br />

<br />
Remember:  The only way to stop me is to kill me, and if I'm dead tomorrow,
<br />
Clinton did it.
