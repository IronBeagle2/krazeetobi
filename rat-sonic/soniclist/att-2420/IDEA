Tails ran behind a bush and hid, he was so embaresed.  Bunnie cault him.
"Tails?"  Bunnie said as she walked up to the bush.  "Go away."
Bunnie wanted to say something but desided to just let him calm down.
"OK I'll go now."  She said and walked away.

Tails was angery at him self.  He looked down.  "This is your fault."
Why did he start, it all started when he took that bath last week.  Cleaning
him self using soap and when he went to clean it...  Tales grumbled at the
thought why did it feel so good and why did he try it again behind the bush.
Bunnie saw him aaaaahhh now what.  Can he ever face her again.  What would
she think.
