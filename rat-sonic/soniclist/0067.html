<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night had fallen over the Great Forest.  All throughout Knothole, 
<br />
freedom fighters were retiring for the night.  Summer had just started, 
<br />
but the nights remained a little chilly in the Forest, considering it's 
<br />
somewhat high altitude.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails lay in bed trying to go to sleep.  It was that time between 
<br />
getting in bed and actually going to sleep when one's mind wanders to all 
<br />
sorts of different thoughts and ideas.  Tails thought about lots of things 
<br />
during this time.  He turned his head slightly and looked out the window to
<br />
the stars above.  It's a beautiful night out, he thought to himself.  
<br />
Whenever he looked at the stars, he always paid attention to one specific 
<br />
constellation.  It was one that he remembered seeing all the time over 
<br />
his old home. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home, he thought.  A day had never passed that he didn't think of 
<br />
it.  The peace, the tranquility, his parents.  He missed his parents a good
<br />
deal.  Missing them wasn't so bad, the problem was he didn't know if they 
<br />
were alive or dead, and, if they were alive, if they were robotizized or 
<br />
not.  It hadn't been that long ago when they were separated, only three 
<br />
years.  That had been when he was seven, but the memories were still 
<br />
fresh in his mind as if they had happened yesterday...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The village of Bluebrook was a quiet little place populated by 
<br />
people living normal lives.  It was quite a distance away from Robotropolis.
<br />
So far in fact that, combined with the concealment by the natural landscape,
<br />
most thought that Robotnik would never find them.  All they had to do was 
<br />
keep a low profile.  It had been Tails' home for a long as he could 
<br />
remember.  His parents, Elrond and Sarah Prower, were kind, loving parents 
<br />
that tried to make their son's life as pleasant and enjoyable as possible.  
<br />
The one part of his life, however, that he had never agreed with was their 
<br />
choice of names.  When he was born, they had named him Miles.  It was a 
<br />
name that he had never liked, and, when he was four, started calling 
<br />
himself Tails because he thought that it suited him far better.  The 
<br />
young fox had, in fact, been born with two tails.  Not actually a birth 
<br />
defect, it was simply the result of a normally suppressed gene that had 
<br />
become dominant in his case.  Other than that, Tails' life was 
<br />
uneventful, but all that was about to change.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cmdr. Packbell sat at his desk in his secret room looking over 
<br />
information on his computer terminal.  He had been getting reports 
<br />
recently of freedom fighter activity from various locations around the 
<br />
planet, and it was up to him to eliminate them if he could.  It wasn't 
<br />
something that he was particularly concerned about given his perfect 
<br />
track record, except that he was always having to convince Robotnik of 
<br />
his ability.  He really hated Robotnik.  He found it hard sometimes to 
<br />
have the patience to wait for that one day when he would crush Robotnik 
<br />
and take his place as ruler of Mobius.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well, he thought.  He looked down the list of possible freedom 
<br />
fighter locations.  The list had ten names on it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem, thought Packbell, I'll just lay out a flight plan 
<br />
that takes me through all ten of them and nail whichever ones I can. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled to himself as he began to lay out his strategy.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, back in Bluebrook, life went about it's business.  
<br />
Elrond Prower was talking with the leader of the village, one Riff 
<br />
Underwood, a swift, smart rabbit with natural leadership abilities.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think we might have a problem,&quot; Riff was saying &quot;Recent 
<br />
reports indicate that there's been a good deal of activity in 
<br />
Robotropolis as of late.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think it poses any type of threat to us?&quot; asked Elrond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not at the moment, but it might,&quot; Riff replied &quot;I'm going to 
<br />
order that this village keep as low a profile as possible.  If we draw any 
<br />
attention to ourselves in anyway the results would be disastrous.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then it's to be hoped that we don't draw any attention,&quot; 
<br />
responded Elrond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He checked his chronometer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's getting late,&quot; he said &quot;I need to get home.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night, Elrond,&quot; said Riff.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elrond arrived at his home to find his wife and son waiting for him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, what did you and Riff talk about all day?&quot; asked Sarah as 
<br />
they sat down for dinner.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not much,&quot; replied Elrond, glancing at Tails briefly &quot;just the 
<br />
weather and the party next week.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's good,&quot; remark Sarah.  She knew from his expression that 
<br />
he had more to say, but neither of them ever talked about such things in 
<br />
front of their son.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; said Elrond &quot;Riff and I are going to inspect 
<br />
some of the forest areas around the village tomorrow for possible look-out 
<br />
sites so I might be getting home a little late.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You always come home late, Dad,&quot; said Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, Miles,&quot; said Elrond &quot;but it's all for the good of the 
<br />
community.  You wouldn't want nasty old Robotnik to show up because we 
<br />
didn't take any precautions, would you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bring him on!&quot; said Tails excitedly &quot;I'd run circles around him 
<br />
and beat him into the ground just like Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You really believe in him don't you,&quot; remarked Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You bet.  Sonic's my hero,&quot; said Tails &quot;Can I be excused.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; said Elrond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails got up and left the room.  After he left, Sarah turned to 
<br />
her husband.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think he listens to that travelling storyteller too much,&quot; 
<br />
Sarah said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's good that he should have something to believe in,&quot; 
<br />
said Elrond &quot;especially during times like these.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;True enough I suppose,&quot; said Sarah &quot;Now, what were you and Riff 
<br />
really talking about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's been some concern lately that Robotnik's forces might 
<br />
locate this village,&quot; said Elrond quietly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How much concern?&quot; asked Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's not a real danger yet, but Riff feels we'll need to 
<br />
start taking more precautions from now on,&quot; said Elrond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I just hope that Robotnik never finds this place,&quot; 
<br />
remarked Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So do I,&quot; replied Elrond.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two foxes cleaned off the table as night fell into place.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, Sarah entered Tails' bedroom and sat down 
<br />
beside him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Would you like to hear a story before you go to bed Miles?&quot; she 
<br />
asked, knowing what he'd say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes!&quot; he replied as he settled further into his bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want to hear?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me more about what it was like before the war,&quot; he asked 
<br />
sleepily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah smiled at her son.  Tails had been born one year after 
<br />
Robotnik had taken control of the planet.  For as long as he could 
<br />
remember, there was the war and nothing else.  Sarah sat back in her 
<br />
chair and started to speak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Before the war, there was clean air and sunshine.  People were 
<br />
free and could go where ever they wished.  We were ruled by a good and wise 
<br />
King.  He made sure that every citizen was provided with what they 
<br />
needed and that the balance between nature and technology was  maintained. 
<br />
There were pure white clouds in the sky.  There were large open fields 
<br />
where you could run and play and not feel yourself in any danger.  You 
<br />
didn't have to hide yourself away when certain people came by.  In 
<br />
Mobitropolis, there was once a beautiful fountain outside the royal 
<br />
palace.  In the diamond mountains there was a time where you could 
<br />
surround yourself in rainbows if the light from the rising sun struck 
<br />
them just right.  Mobius was a place of beauty, peace, joy, and freedom.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sarah looked down at her sleeping child.  Despite all the love 
<br />
she held for him, it hurt to see him sometimes.  He was growing up in a 
<br />
world that would not allow him to take advantage of the things she 
<br />
herself had once known.  The world of a peaceful Mobius was just a 
<br />
fantasy in his mind instead of the wonderful reality she had taken for 
<br />
granted.  These days she only held one true hope in her heart and that 
<br />
was that her son should have a chance to see a peaceful Mobius.  One 
<br />
that wasn't at war.  Neither she nor Elrond mattered now.  She wanted 
<br />
her son to know peace.  She wanted him to know, to feel, the wonderful 
<br />
feelings and experiences that she and Elrond held in their memories.  
<br />
Standing quietly, she turned out the light and left the room.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the night passed, Pacbell's forces moved swiftly but silently 
<br />
through the skies.  Pacbell was feeling very pleased with himself.  He 
<br />
had managed to capture 245 freedom fighters so far and there were only two 
<br />
village names left on his list.  With any luck, he decided, he should 
<br />
have them taken care of by noon the next day.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning as promised, Elrond left to go meet Riff at the 
<br />
edge of the village.  They had only been exploring the area for twenty 
<br />
minutes when their sensors picked up something.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it,&quot; asked Riff.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elrond studied the reading a moment longer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think it's a robotropolis attack force,&quot; Elrond said nervously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've got to get back and warn the village!&quot; exclaimed Riff.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two ran back to the village as fast as they could go.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, deep in The Great Forest, at the top secret freedom 
<br />
fighter village of Knothole, life was proceeding normally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Sally was sitting in front of her communications 
<br />
monitoring console fixing a few things when it suddenly picked up a faint 
<br />
transmission on a coded frequency.  Dropping what she was doing, Sally 
<br />
had NICOLE break the code and display the resulting message on the screen:
<br />

<br />
PRIORITY MESSAGE TO ROBOTROPOLIS CENTRAL COMMAND
<br />

<br />
FROM: CMDR. PACKBELL
<br />
SERVICE NO.:  546003-3F
<br />

<br />
REPORT:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SEARCH AND CAPTURE MISSION IS A SUCCESS.  CURRENTLY FINISHING 
<br />
OPERATION ON BLUEBROOK VILLAGE.  NUMBER CAPTURED AS OF THIS TIME -- 304.  
<br />
ESTIMATED TIME TO FINISH -- 5:00 MINUTES. . .
<br />

<br />
--- PACKBELL
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realizing the urgency of the situation, Sally jumped up and ran 
<br />
to get the others.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the village of Bluebrook was in utter chaos.  
<br />
Creatures were fleeing in every direction to escape the Swat-bots 
<br />
marching through the village.  Some tried to fight them, but it was a 
<br />
hopeless battle.  Through the panic, Packbell walked confidently, taking 
<br />
pot shots at everything that moved, not really caring what he hit.  As 
<br />
he walked through the village, he relished the screams of terror and the 
<br />
sight of panicked creatures fleeing for their lives.  To a twisted mind 
<br />
like his, this was paradise.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When it was finally over, he totalled up the captures as the 
<br />
surviving prisoners were marched into the transports.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;25 foxes, 43 ferrets, 12 rabbits, 13 raccoons, and 5 hedgehogs,&quot; 
<br />
he noted to himself &quot;not a bad score at all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He smiled a little as he turned and went back to his private 
<br />
shuttle to return to Robotropolis with his latest catch.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short while later, a stolen shuttle landed in the middle of 
<br />
what was once a village of peace.  Sally, Bunnie, Rotor, and Bookshire 
<br />
emerged as Sonic raced up to meet them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're too late,&quot; Sonic said &quot;the place is deserted.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five were silent for a moment before Sally spoke.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well,&quot; she said &quot;It looks like all that left is to clean 
<br />
up.  Bunnie and I will check for anything salvageable.  Sonic, you can 
<br />
patrol the perimeter for danger.  Bookshire and Rotor will count the 
<br />
casualties.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The five went about the grim task that Robotnik's forces left for 
<br />
them.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well done, indeed, commander,&quot; Robotnik was saying &quot;I'd promote 
<br />
you if you weren't already in one of the highest positions in the central 
<br />
command.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course, sir,&quot; responded Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, since I can't promote you, you can just keep doing what 
<br />
you've been doing and be happy with that,&quot; said Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, sir,&quot; answered Packbell flatly.  He turned on his 
<br />
heel and left, kicking Snively roughly to one side as he passed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell went down to the main robotization center where those 
<br />
whom he had captured were being put through the Robotizizer.  As they went, 
<br />
some shouted defiance and threats, others begged for mercy and their 
<br />
lives, others simply cried.  Some where still in shock and remained silent.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Packbell watched, he noted two foxes with calm, collected 
<br />
expressions. Two who had apparently resigned themselves to their fate.  
<br />
Either that or they what to be Martyrs sacrificing themselves for their 
<br />
cause, thought Pacbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh well,&quot; he said to himself &quot;too bad there's no one around to 
<br />
make a note of it for the history books.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacbell turned and left the machines to their work.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the site of the ruins of what was once the village of 
<br />
Bluebrook, the freedom fighters continued with their tasks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire was crouched by a fallen creature looking for 
<br />
identification when Rotor walked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are two more back behind that building,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire sigh in response.  He located and ID card and silently 
<br />
read it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Riff Underwood, village leader,&quot; he said quietly &quot;what a loss.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is a nightmare,&quot; grumbled Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know,&quot; responded Bookshire as he stood &quot;Well, that just about 
<br />
does it, let's find Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Bunnie were picking through the wreckage looking for 
<br />
anything they might be able to use.  As they picked through the rubble of 
<br />
one of the houses, they suddenly heard a noise that sounded as if it had 
<br />
come from one of the back rooms.  The two walked carefully through the 
<br />
debris and into what must have, at one time, been a bedroom. The room 
<br />
wasn't quite as messy as the rest of the house.  Apparently, the bots 
<br />
didn't search it.  As they enter the room, Sally and Bunnie heard something 
<br />
under the bed.  When they bent down to look, a surprising sight met 
<br />
their eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Crouched under the bed with his face buried in his arms and 
<br />
trembling uncontrollably was a small fox that couldn't be any more than 
<br />
seven or eight at the most.  The two tried getting his attention, but it 
<br />
soon became obvious that he had been terrified out of his senses.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie,&quot; said Sally &quot;we need to get at him.  Can you move this bed?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing,&quot; replied Bunnie.  She seized the bed with her 
<br />
robotic arm and moved it easily to one side.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they knelt down next to him, Bookshire and Rotor entered.  
<br />
They were momentarily startled by the appearance of a survivor, but they 
<br />
continued with their report.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're all finished,&quot; said Rotor &quot;we counted thirty-five.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you very much,&quot; said Sally &quot;This disaster, as you can see, 
<br />
has taken a new twist.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire knelt down beside the fox and examined him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like extreme shock,&quot; he concluded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, that was my guess too,&quot; said Sally &quot;Needless to say, we'll 
<br />
take him back to Knothole with us when we leave.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good idea,&quot; said Sonic as he raced up &quot;there's a swat-bot patrol 
<br />
heading this way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie picked up the fox and they ran back to the shuttle where 
<br />
they took off and headed back to Knothole at top speed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they arrived back at Knothole, the fox had been placed in a 
<br />
spare room just adjacent to Sally's room where he began his recovery from 
<br />
the terrible events he had witnessed.  It wasn't until three days later 
<br />
that he came around and was actually conscious of his surroundings.  
<br />
When he first opened his eyes, Sally and Sonic were sitting beside the bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You don't need to be afraid,&quot; Sally assured him &quot;you're with 
<br />
friends.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who are you?&quot; the fox asked a little shakily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My name is Sally, and this is Sonic,&quot; replied Sally &quot;and what's 
<br />
your name?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My real name is Miles, but I like Tails,&quot; Tails replied &quot;Are you 
<br />
really Sonic the Hedgehog?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Indeed I am,&quot; said Sonic &quot;You've heard of me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you kidding?&quot; exclaimed Tails, brightening up considerably 
<br />
&quot;You're my hero!  Every time the traveling storyteller came to my 
<br />
village, he did nothing but talk about you!  Are you really as fast as 
<br />
they say you are?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Am I fast!? Am I fast!?. . .,&quot;began Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rolled her eyes.  Here we go again, she thought.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is the sky blue, is dirt dirty?  I'm the fastest thing on the 
<br />
face of the planet!&quot; said Sonic, proudly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow,&quot; remarked Tails.  He was completely awestruck.  After all 
<br />
of the stories he had heard, he had finally met his hero.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well, thought Sally, at least that should make his recovery 
<br />
easier.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, in fact, the recovery went very smoothly.  It did take some 
<br />
time for Tails to come to terms with the fact that he had been separated 
<br />
from his parents and that it wasn't likely he'd see them again for quite 
<br />
a while, but he accepted it eventually.  His parents had taught him well to 
<br />
accept whatever life gave him.  It didn't mean he liked his situation, 
<br />
but he had accepted that that's the way it was.  During one of the first 
<br />
nights he spent in Knothole, he promised himself that he'd find his parents 
<br />
again one day, and, until then, he had good friends that would look out 
<br />
for him and take care of him until he did.  One day, he'd find them again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day . . .
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails drifted of to sleep quietly that chilly night at the 
<br />
beginning of Summer. Those last words and the images of the past were 
<br />
that last things in his mind before it collapsed into sleep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night passed in The Great Forest.  Every freedom fighter slept 
<br />
peacefully.  Each one held the dream that one day they would find true 
<br />
happiness again with loved ones they had lost.  each one waited patiently 
<br />
for that one day when peace would once again reign over Mobius and they 
<br />
would be able to live normal lives again.  Deep in their hearts, they 
<br />
knew that day would come.  All these things would almost certainly come to 
<br />
pass. . . 
<br />

<br />
. . . one day.
<br />

<br />

<br />
THE END
<br />
