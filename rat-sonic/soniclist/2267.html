&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, after some nice email from the folks on the list, I've 
<br />
gotten around to posting parts 3 and 4 of the &quot;Visions in the wind&quot; fan fic.
<br />
I hope you enjoy them.
<br />

<br />
Visions in the Wind: Friends Well Met.
<br />

<br />
by Ed Becerra
<br />

<br />
-----------------------------------
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Somewhere between Robotopolis and the Great Forest...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aaargh!  I gotta take a rest.  If I don't, I swear my spine's gonna jump
<br />
right outta my body and beat me to death, just to put an end to the back
<br />
pain.&quot; muttered Edward Coyote.  &quot;I don't care how badly Old Man wants to
<br />
talk to this Davey Crockett guy.  I can't do the job, if I can't bloody
<br />
_walk_, now can I?  And if he's got any complaints, well, they can just wait
<br />
'til AFTER I rest.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He spotted a clump of trees a short distance away.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, that's the ticket.  Cover, concealment, and some shade.  Just what
<br />
I need.  Now if I can just get there without falling on my face...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few minutes later, Kickaha had reached the small patch of trees, and
<br />
had found a mid-sized one to rest underneath.  He shed his pack, and laid
<br />
the shotgun he'd jacked from the SWATbot down beside it.  Holding tightly to
<br />
his ironwood cane, he carefully eased himself down to the ground.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned back against the trunk.  &quot;Aaaahhhhh!  That's... good, soooo...
<br />
good.  Yeah.  That helps.  That helps _a lot_!&quot; He let out a sigh.  &quot;I'll
<br />
just rest here for a little bit.&quot; he said tiredly.  &quot;Just a few minutes,
<br />
that's all.  I'll just sit here a few minutes, only a few.  No more than
<br />
that.  Just a few minutes.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little while later...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Small non-sentient animals were running in sheer terror from the hideous
<br />
sounds coming from the nearby trees.  Birds and winged insects were flying
<br />
for their lives.  Even the plants were doing their best to cringe in pain.
<br />
Was Packbell torturing a Freedom Fighter?  Was some poor innocent caught in
<br />
one of Snivley's death traps?  What horrible thing had happened under the
<br />
trees?
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha had fallen asleep.  All of his tribe, indeed, most of the Wild
<br />
Pack had told him that he snored.  Loudly.  Badly.  In tones that could bend
<br />
metal and shatter glass.  He refused to believe them.  Now he was asleep and
<br />
snoring again.  Too bad for the poor creatures around him.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hours later...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sizzling lightning-bolt whipcracks of electro-magnetic pulse blasts
<br />
echoing through the trees woke Kickaha from his slumber.  He spared no time
<br />
in blaming himself for falling asleep.  There were more important things at
<br />
hand, right now.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gunfire?!  Combat?!  Somebody threw a firefight and forgot to invite
<br />
me?!!  I am seriously _TICKED OFF_!  How DARE they have a battle and not
<br />
include me?!  Aaaarrgh!  SOMEONE WILL PAY FOR THIS!&quot; Edward was _not_
<br />
amused.  He'd missed out on too many fights, already.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He grabbed his pack, then hefted his shotgun and checked it's status.
<br />
*Full magazine, round in the chamber, safety off.  Right, then.  Time to 
<br />
see just what the FUBAR is goin' on here!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hobbled quickly towards the sounds of battle.  &quot;If it's them damn
<br />
Swats again, I am definitely gonna get me a cycle _this_ time.&quot; he growled.
<br />
&quot;I AM SICK AND TIRED OF WALKING!!  AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few moments later, he'd reached a small clearing, where he was able to
<br />
get a good look at what was going on.  From where he stood, it looked like a
<br />
band of Freedom Fighters were beating the living crud out of one of
<br />
Robotnik's Hover Bots.  And Kickaha was missing out on all the fun.  Damn.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time, a hovercycle had somehow moored itself to the side of the
<br />
Hover Bot.  Ed heard two shots fired from a weapon he was unfamiliar with,
<br />
and then watched as a number of rebels boarded the Hover Bot and stripped it
<br />
of the supplies it was carrying.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Hey!* thought Kickaha.  *Maybe this group can tell me where I can find
<br />
Princess Sally and her village.  After all, I can't wander around aimlessly
<br />
like this forever.  If I can just catch up with them, or even follow them
<br />
back to their base, that'll solve a lot of problems.  Even if they can't
<br />
help me, I can still use fresh supplies, a little R &amp; R, and a few nights in
<br />
a place with indoor plumbing!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About then, he noticed that the rebels had abandoned the Hover Bot, and
<br />
caught sight of a tall fox leaping aboard the cycle and high-tailing it hell
<br />
for leather.  The Hover Bot then destroyed itself in an example of
<br />
pyro-technic Chain-Reaction-Ultra-Destruction that warmed Kickaha's heart.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Beauty!  Wonder what explosive they used?  And where I can score some
<br />
for myself.  I haven't set a good booby-trap in ages.  I start feeling a
<br />
little cranky when I haven't blown something up recently... Hey!  What in
<br />
the name of the Great Spirit is THAT?!*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THAT, as Kickaha put it, was a shooting star, and a peculiar looking one
<br />
at that.  First, it was glowing bright green!  Second, it _wasn't_ burning
<br />
up in the atmosphere, like most shooting stars.  And finally, it was going
<br />
to hit in this general area... in about... 15 SECONDS?!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*AAAAHHHHH!!!!  RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!*
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, the fox on the Hovercycle was going one on one with a pack of
<br />
Swats.  It hadn't noticed the eerie green glow coming from the strange
<br />
shooting star.  It was yelling at the top of it's voice, &quot;RRRRRRAAAAAAAA!&quot;
<br />
The fox, a Swatbot, and the star all met at the same spot.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ouch!&quot; said Ed.  *He's gonna feel _that_ in the morning!* he thought.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the blast wave caught Kickaha, as well.  He had time enough for one
<br />
last thought, before it blew him into the trees.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Bet _this_ is gonna leave a mark!*
<br />

<br />
***********************************
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!  Princess!  Dere's somebody over 'ere!  An' it looks like 'e got
<br />
clocked real good!  Hey, you dere!  You okay?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... unnhhh ...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other rebels had left the tavern that had caught the fox who'd been
<br />
riding the now-wrecked hovercycle.  They headed over to where Speed had
<br />
apparently found another casualty of the battle.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purple hedgehog shook the shoulders of the middle-aged coyote she'd
<br />
found sprawled unconscious beneath a nearby tree.  &quot;Hey, you!  Ennybody in
<br />
dere?  Wake up, awready!  Da fight's over.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;.... nO mOrE puLquE fOr mE, tHaNkS.  i'M dRiViNg ....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time Princess Sally was standing beside them.  Since it didn't
<br />
look like the coyote was going to regain his senses anytime soon, she gave
<br />
orders to have him taken back with them to Knothole, after being thoroughly
<br />
searched for hidden transmitters that could lead Snivley to the hidden
<br />
village.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gathered up his belongings, and as they did, Ryan noted that the
<br />
coyote was carrying a shotgun taken from a SWATbot.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Davey, scope this!&quot; Ryan held up the shotgun.  &quot;Do you think he's
<br />
working for Snively?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not unless he's _really_ stupid.  I don't think there's anyone on Mobius
<br />
that trusts Snively as far as they can throw him.  Not even Packbell.
<br />
Especially not Packbell.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good point!  Heh-heh.  Snively's a butthead!  Heh-heh.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I'm Butthead, you're Bevis.  Snively's the idiot.  Huh-huh-huh.  I
<br />
made a joke.  Jokes are cool.  Huh-huh-huh.&quot; Davey snickered, rubbing a sore
<br />
neck from the fall.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elizabeth Raccoon rolled her eyes.  &quot;Oil all over the place, and now bad
<br />
jokes.  So mature.  NOT!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They loaded the injured coyote aboard the transport they'd brought to
<br />
carry the supplies, and headed back for Knothole.
<br />

<br />
***********************************
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey was riding back to Knothole in the transport with their unexpected
<br />
guest.  Sally had insisted, after the spill he'd taken.  He looked at the
<br />
semi-conscious passenger curiously.  He'd seen plenty of other Mobians, but
<br />
never a coyote before.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess, I don't recall seeing any coyotes among the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
Why is that?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked back at him.  &quot;They don't seem to mix much, and those few
<br />
who were around Mobotropolis before the coup were pretty quiet, as a rule.
<br />
They didn't talk much, and tended to stick with their own tribes, out near
<br />
the Rocky Mountains and the High Prairie.  That's some distance from here.
<br />
It's a bit surprising to see one of them this far away from their native
<br />
lands.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmm...  You don't say.&quot; There was something vaguely familiar about this
<br />
coyote to Davey.  But he couldn't quite put his finger on it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Well, I can always find out later, when we get back.* he thought.  *If
<br />
it's important, I'll remember it, eventually.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... uuhhhgg ... did anybody get... the licence plate... of that
<br />
SWATbot... uunnnhh...&quot; This from the coyote, who seemed to be coming
<br />
around.  He looked a little confused.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey spoke to him, calmingly.  &quot;You're going to be O.K.  Everthing's all
<br />
right.  You just took a bit of a blow back there.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;oooohhhh.... man, what a head I've got.  Excedrin headache Number
<br />
3.1415927.  Anybody... uggh... got an aspirin?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you know who you are?  Do you remember your name?&quot; asked Sally, who
<br />
was worried about possible head injuries.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Kickaha.  Edward Anthony Coyote.  I think.  Tell the guy with the
<br />
jackhammer to lay off my head, willya?  Ow!  And who are you?  Where am I?
<br />
Last thing I remember, I was in the forest watching some rebels stomp a
<br />
Hover Bot flat.&quot; he groaned.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That was us.  We found you unconscious under a tree.  It looked like the
<br />
explosion slammed you into a trunk and knocked you out.&quot; she said.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Figures.  Just my luck.  Say, can you folks help me?  I used to be a
<br />
rebel, a long time ago.  I'm looking for Princess Sally and her Freedom
<br />
Fighters, and a fox named Davey Crockett.  Would you know where they are, 
<br />
or how I can get in touch with them?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Sally looked a little startled.  &quot;I think we need to have a
<br />
talk, Kickaha.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked around at them.  &quot;Oh, no!&quot; he moaned.  &quot;Don't tell me.  Lemme
<br />
guess.&quot; He pointed at her.  &quot;You're Princess Sally.&quot; He turned to look at
<br />
Davey.  &quot;And you're David Kintobor, aka Davey Crockett.&quot; He buried his face
<br />
in his paws.  &quot;Old Man, you done it to me again.  Ah'm gonna get you fer
<br />
this one.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He began to rise, then collapsed to the floor in a heap.  Davey and Sally
<br />
started towards him, worry written on their faces.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No!  Don't!  It's just my back.  I had an old injury, and I've been
<br />
walking for weeks, making it worse.  I'll be okay.  Just... don't move me,
<br />
please?  That'll make it worse.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right.  But when we get to Knothole, you're going straight to the
<br />
infirmary.  Don't try and fight me on this.&quot; Sally's expression was stern.
<br />
&quot;I've had enough trouble from people who won't listen to good advice.&quot; She
<br />
gave Davey a _look_.  &quot;I don't need another one on my hands.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;... owch ... you're getting no complaints from me, Princess.  I'm ...
<br />
aahh ...  in no position to complain.  Heh.  Just don't move me 'till we get
<br />
there.  Please?&quot;
<br />

<br />
**********************************
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the infirmary...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two cots were side by side.  Davey was sitting on one, with Kickaha lying
<br />
on the other.  They'd had to bring him in on a stretcher.  He looked like a
<br />
pretzel, he was so twisted.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey was feeling curious, and wanted to take Ed's mind off his problem,
<br />
so he thought he'd ask him a few questions
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, Kickaha--that's the name?--how'd you become a Freedom Fighter?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Early in your father's coup.  I happened to be around Mobotropolis when
<br />
it started, so I became one of the early rebels.  I didn't last long though.
<br />
..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Flashback:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside an armored mortar carrier, first year of the coup.  Kickaha's
<br />
trying to repair a balky swivel plate on the mortar.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey Obie!  Pass the toolbox an' the baseplate over here, Please?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing, Kickaha.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a _kick_, the toolbox was sent *flying* into the carrier.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ow!!  Hey!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The baseplate, a round flat piece of steel shaped like a thick manhole
<br />
cover, came next.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;AAAAAAAAAA!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It landed on top of Ed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CRUNCH!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;uuuuuh. . . my hero . . . pele . . . &quot;
<br />

<br />
End Flashback:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lucky me, my back didn't break.  It went bad nonetheless.  Got weak legs
<br />
and a bad case of Rheumatism as well, thanks to Mr.  World Cup champ!  I got
<br />
a medical discharge and returned to my Wild Pack tribe.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wild Pack, you say.&quot; Davey said as he listened.  Scoping the coyote at
<br />
the infirmary cot next to him, he saw the stuff Kickaha brought with him--a
<br />
Dream Catcher, a ceremonial pipe, various amulets and a medicine bag on a
<br />
necklace--that reminded Davey of a race of people he calls 'Native
<br />
Americans.' This 'Wild Pack' must be Mobius' answer to that culture, or so
<br />
Davey surmised.  &quot;How'd you been going all this time?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I lived day by day, following the wind, listening to the spirits,
<br />
Wild Pack stuff.&quot; Kickaha smirked at Davey.  &quot;I don't know if you'd be
<br />
interested.&quot; *Gotcha!  But I gotta be careful he doesn't slip the hook.  Old
<br />
Man 'll have my hide for his headdress if I blow this one.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I could.  Your culture reminds me of a similar culture from my planet.
<br />
I had a book of their stories that I really loved as a kid.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right about then a tall, good looking cyber-hedgehog entered the room.
<br />
She headed straight for Davey.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Davey!  How ya doing?&quot; She hugged and kissed the tall fox.  &quot;Speed told
<br />
me all about that Chaos Emerald that almost nailed ya.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?  I mean, Excuse me?&quot; Kickaha was a little puzzled.  &quot;What Chaos
<br />
Emerald?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha then got the instant replay of what things had looked like from
<br />
Davey's point of view, courtesy of Davey's holo-projector.  While this took
<br />
place, Suni examined her man.  Except for a slight case of whiplash that she
<br />
quickly healed, Davey was unharmed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wow!  All that happened around you and you walked without a scratch?!?
<br />
Looks like some of our spirits are starting to like you!&quot; Kickaha laughed.
<br />
*Damn, you work fast, Old Man!  Or was that even you?  I'd better check.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You ask me, I'd say it's just the worst case of Bad Karma on two
<br />
planets.&quot; said Davey in pessimistic tones.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Suni worked on her man, Kickaha took a closer look at Davey.  *By
<br />
the Great Horn Spoon!  I haven't see an aura like that for some time.  You
<br />
were right, Old Man, he _is_ one of us.  And _very_ powerful.  This could
<br />
present some problems.  I've got to think on this.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quirked an eyebrow at David from the cot.  &quot;What Bad Karma?  The Bad
<br />
Karma you got from your Daddy?  I beg to differ, my friend.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Sally entered the infirmary right then.  She didn't look at all
<br />
happy with Davey.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As do I.  I'm going to keep repeating this; I ordered all of Knothole to
<br />
repeat it, until it gets into that thick stubborn head of yours.&quot; She got in
<br />
Davey's face, grabbed him by the ears, and raised her voice.  &quot;You are not
<br />
to answer for the crimes of your father, David Jim Kintobor.  Not by us, not
<br />
by our gods, and not by your own damn guilty conscious.  Not if I can help
<br />
it!  I'd bop you on that thick head of yours with a very large hammer to
<br />
give you amnesia, but Suni would kill me if I did, so I have to shout it
<br />
into that thick head of yours and let it rattle in what you use for a brain
<br />
every now and then until it finally sticks!&quot; She let go of him, then.
<br />
&quot;Besides, we've gotta talk about what Julian found.  Is he going to be fine,
<br />
Suni, as least, relatively?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's gonna be fine.  You don't have to worry about Davey's inner
<br />
demons.&quot; She hugged Davey and stroked his pelt.  &quot;I'll take care of them.
<br />
You go now, Hon.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kickaha was thinking, *Better not push it right now.  Besides, looks like
<br />
the Healer, what was her name?  Oh, yeah.  Sonia.  Looks like I'm next on
<br />
her list.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He waved as Davey left the room.  &quot;We'll continue this later ...&quot;
<br />

<br />
***********************************
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know how much I can do for you, Edward.  Your injuries are so
<br />
old, so much a part of you, your body's accepted them as what's natural for
<br />
you.  But I can ease the pain somewhat, and reduce the swelling.&quot; Sonia
<br />
frowned.  She didn't like being unable to help a patient.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't distress yourself, lass.  I accepted my lot a long time ago.  And
<br />
easing the pain is a blessing.&quot; He smiled at her.  &quot;Just do your best, and
<br />
you'll have nothing to feel sorry for.  And please, call me Kickaha.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*The spirits are strong with this one.  Mother Earth is a force within
<br />
her.  Well, she IS a healer.  But I sense _fire_, as well!  She bears
<br />
watching.*
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But there may be _another_ way, Ed..  urr..  Kickaha.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Eh?  What might that be?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonia explained the modifications King Acorn and David had made to Sir
<br />
Charles's Roboticizer.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmm.  Sounds like just the ticket.  I'll look into it.  Thank you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
***********************************
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being treated by Sonia, Kickaha was moved into Davey's hut, until
<br />
Knothole could build him one of his own.  He was mobile again, with the help
<br />
of his cane, and went looking for Davey.  He found him gathering together a
<br />
raiding party.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd love to join in, but I don't think I'd do you any good right now.
<br />
At the moment, a stunned snail could outrace me.  I've heard of this more
<br />
original design of Chuck's prized machine you've perfected, Dave, and I feel
<br />
that it'll do me good.  Can't wait to be a Borg.&quot; Ed chuckled.  &quot;Go Borg
<br />
them one for me!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Davey flicked his fingers on the brim of his cap.  &quot;Will do, Kickaha.&quot;
<br />
Then he headed off for Robotroplis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ed returned to the hut to rest.  As he entered, he heard the soft brush
<br />
of feathers behind him.  He turned to look over his shoulder and saw a large
<br />
black crow on Davey's windowsill.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, Old Man.  Think Davey's got potential?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I dunno,&quot; the crow answered.  &quot;You told him about me yet?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not yet.  He said that he's interested in some stories about you,
<br />
though.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  Let me meet him first, Kickaha.  And then, when he's curious,
<br />
he'll come to you.  Let him know then.&quot; The crow spread his wings and took
<br />
flight, following David.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He watched as the crow landed on Dave's shoulder, then turned to find a
<br />
soft chair to rest in.  He moved it so he could look out at Knothole as he
<br />
sat.  He started to laugh.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wonder if Knothole knows what it's gotten itself into now?  Well, Old
<br />
Man, you _did_ keep your word to me.  Life's been a lot of things since you
<br />
walked into mine, all those years ago, but it's never been _dull_!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He laughed softly for some time, then quietly fell asleep in the chair.
<br />
His dreams were...  interesting.
