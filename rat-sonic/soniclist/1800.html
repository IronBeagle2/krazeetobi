Part 4
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was using Nicole to studying some information that had recently
<br />
been hacked from Robotnik's computers when she heard a knock.  &quot;Come in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sebastian.  &quot;Hello, Sally.  I have an idea I want to discuss
<br />
with you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure, Sebastian.  Here, sit down.&quot;  She offered the space beside her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian did so.  &quot;I was thinking about how I could help the Freedom
<br />
Fighters, and I would like to offer to train them in the martial arts.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought for a moment.  &quot;That sounds like a good idea.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian smiled.  &quot;Great!  It's just that I---&quot;  Glancing at
<br />
Nicole's screen, his voice trailed off.  A word had caught his eye,
<br />
&quot;NILREB&quot;.  He leaned over to try and read the rest.  &quot;May I?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; she said, moving Nicole over for him.  &quot;Is there something
<br />
wrong?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian read.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PLANS TO CONVERT NILREB TO MAJOR RESEARCH CENTER UNDERWAY.  SEARCH AND
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ROBOITICIZATION OF ALL INHABITANTS TO TAKE PLACE IN FIVE DAYS.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sebastian gasped.  &quot;Nilreb!  Oh, no!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot;  Robotnik seemed to like calling all of his cities
<br />
&quot;major research centers&quot;, and Sally had figured this was just a plan to
<br />
search another abandoned city and then begin rebuilding it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are people living in Nilreb.  Lots of people.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally gasped.  &quot;Really?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, but that's not all.  Let me explain.&quot;  Sebastian then told her
<br />
about his time in Nilreb, and what Alison had told him about the city.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally shook her head in amazement.  &quot;So there really are humans left
<br />
on Mobius.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, and they aren't working for Robotnik.  You must believe that. 
<br />
Sally, we need to help them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at the message on Nicole's screen again.  &quot;Okay, we need
<br />
to act quickly then.  This message is dated today, so we have five days to
<br />
work with.  Go find Sonic.  He'll find the others.  Tell him we need to
<br />
have all the Freedom Fighters here for an emergency meeting.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, the Freedom Fighters were all gathered in Sally's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally spoke.  &quot;Okay, please listen.  We have learned that there are
<br />
still humans living on Mobius, and that they are concentrated in one city,
<br />
Nilreb.  We have also learned that Robotnik plans to have all of them
<br />
roboticized and the city turned into another Robotropolis.  We have five
<br />
days to make it to Nilreb and figure out how we can save them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The newest Freedom Fighter recruit, Cat, asked, &quot;Humans?  Can we
<br />
trust them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded.  &quot;Sebastian, here, has been to Nilreb and knows one of
<br />
them.  Now look, I know what you may be thinking about this, but as always
<br />
I expect full devotion to this mission.  If any of you think that you
<br />
won't be able to put aside any doubts about the humans, please leave now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, we leave for Nilreb tomorrow.  Any questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie asked, &quot;What exactly are we gonna be doing over there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't know yet, to be honest.  Once we get to Nilreb, we're going
<br />
to meet with a human named Alison.  From there we will see exactly what we
<br />
can do.  We have five days to work with.  Any more questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were none.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, in the morning, we journey to Nilreb.  Thank you all.&quot;
<br />
