&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 7
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There had once been only a narrow wooded strip between the
<br />
place where the Great Forest and the city of Mobotropolis met. 
<br />
Only a portion of the strip remained; the rest had been cleared and
<br />
just beyond that clearing were acres of garbage.  The children
<br />
stood in the shadows of the trees at the edge of the wood.  Ahead
<br />
of them the once-beautiful city of Mobotropolis was lit by electric
<br />
lamps that cut unnaturally through the polluted air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, girl, this is just awful!&quot; Bunnie whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know, Bunnie.  Robotnik's ruined the whole city.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm talkin' 'bout my ears--the stuff in the air's makin'
<br />
'em wilt!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They'll be OK, Bunnie, but Tails is what matters now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How come it's so warm, Sally?&quot; Rotor asked.  &quot;It was cooler
<br />
in the forest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All the pollution in the air must be trapping the heat from
<br />
the city.  We'd better leave our cloaks here; besides, they might
<br />
get in the way.  OK, Sonic, how do we get to Uncle Chuck's?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How should I know?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You said you knew the way!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, look around!  Too much has changed!  I always used to
<br />
know my way to Uncle Chuck's from the playground in the park. 
<br />
I'd climb to the top of the slide in the park, and I could see
<br />
Uncle Chuck's house from there.  With all this garbage here I don't
<br />
think I can even FIND the park!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can and we will, Sonic.  For Tails' sake.  Now come on,
<br />
we've got to try and find it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children walked cautiously over and around mountains of
<br />
refuse for about ten minutes.  Finally, Sally stopped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's up, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know where we are, Sonic.  I thought we'd be in the
<br />
park's playground by now, but I don't see it anywhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You mean we're lost?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not yet, Bunnie; I just need to get my bearings somehow. 
<br />
Just give me a minute to think.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What if we ain't got a minute, Sally-girl?  Them SWATbots
<br />
could be on their way here right now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Sally was already studying the landscape.  She started
<br />
to walk toward the city, hesitated, then looked to her feet. 
<br />
Kneeling, she began to clear away the debris.  The others gather
<br />
round her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's up, Sal?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This pipe, with what looks like some kind of clamps on it. 
<br />
I think I should know what this is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What're you talkin' about?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Julayla told me to remember, even the smallest things about
<br />
Mobotropolis.  Help me clear off this pipe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children did.  Soon, the top of the pipe was exposed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmm.  There are six clamps of some kind.  That could also
<br />
mean...Oh my gosh!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, what is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, don't you see what this is?&quot; Sally asked excitedly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This pipe...it's the top of the swing set!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come again?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The swing set!  Remember how it had three swings on it. 
<br />
That meant it had six chains holding the seats.  These clamps
<br />
must be the ones that held the chains in place!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I was gonna say that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then the park....&quot; Rotor began.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly.  We've been right all along.  The park is here,
<br />
under all this garbage.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children were silent for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, this is the pits!&quot; Rotor said.  &quot;It's bad enough
<br />
Robotnik had to roboticize everybody, but then he buries the
<br />
playground under tons of garbage!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie started crying: &quot;I want to go home!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie,&quot; Sally said gently but firmly as she grabbed her
<br />
friend by the shoulders, &quot;you ARE home.  This city, this whole
<br />
world, used to BE our home!  And one of these days we're going to
<br />
take it back!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really?&quot; she sniffled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Really.  But right now we've got work to do.  Now if this
<br />
is the swing set, then the slide should be somewhere over there!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally ran off to her left, the others following closely. 
<br />
She began scratching at the garbage heap again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What're we lookin' for, Sally-girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The top of the slide: two curving metal tubes.&quot;  The others
<br />
began scrounging as well.  In less than a minute:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Found 'em!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor had indeed found the handrails of the disused slide. 
<br />
Sally dug some more until she uncovered the well-worn metal plate
<br />
that was the top of the slide.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, Sonic.  Stand here and close your eyes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then see if you can see Uncle Chuck's house.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;With my eyes closed?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your mind, with your heart, your imagination!  Now come
<br />
on, we don't have all night!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was taller than he had been the last time he was on
<br />
the slide, and he had to bend his knees slightly to take hold of
<br />
the railings.  Once he did, however, it all flooded over him.  He
<br />
no sooner closed his eyes and held onto the railing than he
<br />
gasped, opened his eyes, raised his arm and pointed ahead of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the way to Uncle Chuck's.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahead of them, just beyond where the trash stopped, was a
<br />
block of modest homes, homes long deserted.  Some of them were
<br />
already partially buried by the garbage.  &quot;Which one is it?&quot;
<br />
Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That one: fourth from the corner, facing the next street.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great work, Sonic!  Let's go.&quot;  The children began walking
<br />
toward the houses.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, it was like I really COULD see it!  That was way past
<br />
cool!  But what if Tails isn't there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the one thing Sally hadn't allowed herself to think
<br />
about.   &quot;Let's just search your Uncle Chuck's house first,&quot; was
<br />
all she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 8
<br />
<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The modest house which had once been the home and workshop
<br />
of Sir Charles Hedgehog was deserted.  Unlike the other houses,
<br />
it showed signs of having been thoroughly ransacked.  The door
<br />
appeared to have been torn off its hinges, and almost every window
<br />
had been smashed.  Ducking down an alley, the children made their
<br />
way to the small workshop attached to the back of the house.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inside of the workshop resembled the garbage dump the
<br />
children had just left.  Papers and components littered the floor. 
<br />
Dust and grit lay heavy on smashed glass and scattered pieces of
<br />
paper.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh,&quot; Sally whispered, &quot;this place looks like someone
<br />
fought a war in here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is looking like the SWATbots, they destructioned
<br />
everything.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like they haven't been back since.  Maybe they'll leave
<br />
us in peace while we look for...Are you OK, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Back off!  It's just...dusty in here, that's all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It WAS dusty inside the workshop, but Sally didn't see any
<br />
of the others rubbing their eyes the way she saw Sonic rubbing
<br />
his.  She backed off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is your planning, Princess?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can't call out for Tails; the SWATbots might hear us. 
<br />
Look at the floor and see if you can find any footprints; it so
<br />
dusty in here he's bound to have left some if he came this way.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got it, Sal.  Rotor, you and me will check out the store
<br />
room.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Rotor made their way to a room just off the
<br />
workshop.  It may have been a storeroom but it was no mere closet;
<br />
it was at least half the size of the workshop.  Mechanical
<br />
components lay just about everywhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, wow!  Look at this capacitor unit!  Sonic, your Uncle
<br />
Chuck had some great stuff!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is all junk, Rotor!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not after I get through with it.  I gotta take this back
<br />
with us!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That stuff hasn't worked in who knows how long.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Sonic.  I've fixed TOASTERS that were in worse shape
<br />
than this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Worry about your toasters later, man, right now we gotta
<br />
look for Tails!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, Sonic, OK.  But why do I get the feeling I've seen THIS
<br />
thing before?&quot;  Rotor wondered out loud as he looked at a large
<br />
box-like mechanism in the center of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Because it is looking like every other contraptionation you
<br />
have builded in our hut,&quot; Antoine said pointedly.  He had found no
<br />
trace of Tails and had gone to the store room to tell Rotor and
<br />
Sonic.  Sally and Bunnie were right behind him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think so, Ant.  There's just something....&quot;  At a
<br />
loss for words, Rotor tapped the side of the machine.  Immediately,
<br />
there was another sound, one that brought all other sound and
<br />
movement to a halt:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic?  Where are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, it's me!  Where are you, big guy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I felled in here.  I can't find my way out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hang on, honey,&quot; Sally said, as she felt her heart start
<br />
beating again, &quot;we'll find the door.  How did you get in there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I finded the place just like Sonic's map said, but I
<br />
couldn't find where the chili dogs were.  So I opened the door
<br />
and looked in here, but it closed and I can't open it.  I guess I
<br />
felled asleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, Tails, where was the door?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;On this side.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tap on the side for me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a second the others heard Tails tapping on the casing.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, can you get inside there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give me a second to...wait, I think this is an access
<br />
plate.  If I can find where to push...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The top of the plate moved in toward the inside of the
<br />
machine.  The foot of the plate was apparently hinged, and a
<br />
spring at the top was what must have trapped Tails inside and
<br />
prevented him from opening it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You OK, Tails?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh-huh.  But I can't get out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails,&quot; Sally called to him, &quot;you'll have to move away from
<br />
the plate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The...the thing that Rotor's pushing on.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's too tight!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, you have to try!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can't hold this open by myself.  The spring's too tight!  Antoine,
<br />
get over here and lean.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, can you reach around them and pull Tails out of
<br />
there?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll try, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor and Antoine pressed against the access plate.  It
<br />
gave, but at the same time they heard a small yelp from inside
<br />
the machine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You OK, Tails?&quot; Sonic called out.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The door bit me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stand to the side of the door, honey,&quot; Sally called to him,
<br />
&quot;as far as you can go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a second, Rotor and Antoine resumed pushing.  Then, in
<br />
the room's dim light, Sally made out a shape emerging from the
<br />
machine: a waving hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I see you, Tails!  Hang in there.  Sonic, grab on!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took about a minute more of pushing and fidgeting, of
<br />
grabbing and having to let go, but eventually Tails was out of
<br />
the machine with Sonic's arms around him.  Freed of his prison, he
<br />
started to whimper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, everything's cool, big guy.  We got you out of there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He must have leaned against that access plate just enough
<br />
to fall inside,&quot; Sally guessed.  She then cradled the cub's face
<br />
in her hands.  &quot;But I'm just so glad we found....&quot;  She paused.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's up, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, where's the map Sonic gave you last night?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right here,&quot; he said, holding up a crumpled piece of paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails, honey, we have to get rid of it right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But it's mine!  Sonic made it for me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Better do what she says, little bro, or else Robotnik might
<br />
find it.  For me, OK?&quot; Sonic added as Tails showed signs of
<br />
hesitation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, OK,&quot; Tails said as he handed Sally the paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now let's burn this before....  Oh no.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, this isn't your map.  Tails must have dropped it
<br />
inside the machine and picked this up instead.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know; it's too dark to read.  Rotor and Antoine,
<br />
see if you can feel around for that map inside the machine.  The
<br />
rest of us will be in the kitchen; maybe we can find some matches
<br />
in there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Here we are going against,&quot; Antoine sighed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Rotor and Antoine once more did battle with the access
<br />
plate, the others followed Sonic into the kitchen of Uncle
<br />
Chuck's house.  The room appeared orderly, though dusty.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like they didn't bother searching this room,&quot; Sally
<br />
observed.  &quot;Robotnik must have figured that the good stuff was in
<br />
the workshop.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, well he never tasted one of Uncle Chuck's....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, DON'T say it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the matter, you don't like chili dogs?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, it's just that I haven't had anything to eat since
<br />
breakfast and I'm starving!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, somethin' 'round here's killin' MAH appetite!&quot; Bunnie
<br />
said, her nose wrinkling.  &quot;What in the hoo-ha IS that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got the map, Sonic!&quot; Rotor said as he walked into the
<br />
kitchen.  Antoine followed close behind, muttering and brushing
<br />
the dirt from his coat.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sal, I found a candle and some matches in this
<br />
drawer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't light it yet, Sonic!  Make sure the window shades are
<br />
down; we don't want to be seen.&quot;  After a few seconds of pulling
<br />
down what was left of the shades, Sally dared to light the
<br />
candle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, here's the map.  First things first, we'd better burn
<br />
this.  What's that other piece of paper, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a long pause.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know, but it's got Uncle Chuck's writing on it.&quot; 
<br />
Sonic handed the paper to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like random notes:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COOLANT PROBLEM SOLVED
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECURE POWER SOURCE
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EXTRA ONIONS.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Extra onions?'&quot; Rotor asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, that's how Uncle Chuck liked his chil...his you-know-
<br />
whats: with extra onions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;THAT'S what Ah'm smellin'!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What, Bunnie?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children did a quick search of the kitchen and located
<br />
several bins, one of which was labeled ONIONS.  Sally opened it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;EEEEEEEEEWW!  Close it, Sally girl!&quot;  Immediately Sally 
<br />
replaced the lid.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, I didn't know ANYTHING could smell THAT bad!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've got to get rid of those things; they're rotten!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using a ruler from the workshop, Sally scooped out the
<br />
remains of a couple of thoroughly rotted onions.  She pitched
<br />
them out of a broken window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;that takes care of the bad ones.  At
<br />
least the other onions in the bin looked OK.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Sally asked, &quot;when's the last time you heard of
<br />
onions staying fresh for five years?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children looked at each other in silence, then started
<br />
grabbing at the onions in the bin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sacre bleu cheeze.  They are the *plastique*!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't get it, Sal.  Why would Uncle Chuck keep plastic
<br />
onions in this bin?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe there's something about the bin itself.  Help me
<br />
empty it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a matter of seconds the children had dumped all the
<br />
plastic onions onto the floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what, Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me think.&quot;  She spent several seconds looking into the
<br />
empty bin.  She then opened the bin next to it, one marked
<br />
POTATOES.  It was empty as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like we struck out, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not yet.  Let me try something.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally reached into the onion bin until her palm rested flat
<br />
on the bottom.  The top of the bin went just past her elbow. 
<br />
When she tried the same thing with the potato bin, however, the
<br />
top of the bin came up almost to her armpit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I knew it!  This bin must have a false bottom!  Can you get
<br />
me a knife?&quot;  Sonic opened a drawer and produced a long kitchen
<br />
knife.  Sally began using it on the edge of the bottom of the
<br />
bin.  It slid between the bottom and the side wall easily, and
<br />
Sally worked the bottom of the bin loose.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The children backed away in awe.  Underneath the false
<br />
bottom lay a large yellow, faceted stone, about as big as Sally's
<br />
head.  It appeared to glow from within.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh!  This looks like a power stone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A power stone.  It's a source of tremendous energy.  Looks
<br />
like this was where Uncle Chuck kept it hidden.  That may be what
<br />
Uncle Chuck's note meant by 'SECURE POWER SOURCE.'  If Robotnik
<br />
had gotten hold of this....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what do we do, take it back to Knothole?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, Sally,&quot; Rotor said, &quot;I think that stone will fit
<br />
into the top of that machine in the storeroom.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, this is no time to experiment; we've got to get out
<br />
of here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what if that contraption was something important?  What
<br />
if it was something that could be used against Robotnik?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like...I don't know; we have to turn it on.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, we'll see if the stone fits; then we'll HAVE to
<br />
leave!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stone, though sizable, was surprisingly light in weight.
<br />
Rotor carried it back into the storeroom, with the others following
<br />
him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why are you giving to him this indulgence?&quot; Antoine
<br />
whispered to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know; just a feeling I have.  I think this thing IS
<br />
important, somehow.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor guessed correctly that an aperture near the top of the
<br />
machine would accommodate the stone.  After fitting it in, Rotor
<br />
didn't even bother saying anything to Sally, but simply turned on
<br />
what appeared to be the power switch.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first nothing happened.  Then a low humming filled the
<br />
air.  Suddenly, there was a brilliant flash as a metallic ring,
<br />
shining like gold and light, shot up from the top of the machine,
<br />
ricochetted off the ceiling, and landed with a clang at Sonic's
<br />
feet.  Rotor reached over and turned off the power switch.  At
<br />
the same time something else fell to the ground, something that
<br />
had been ejected from the machine just behind the ring.  Sally
<br />
picked it up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, it's an envelope.  With your name on it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Were you hearing that?&quot; Antoine whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, 'Twan, let's go see if this house is haunted,&quot;
<br />
Bunnie teased.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That is not a thing of which to be funny.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe you two had better check it out; see if anyone's
<br />
coming.&quot;  Antoine and Bunnie reluctantly left the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Be careful!&quot; Sally whispered after them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's this thing?&quot; Tails asked as he reached for the ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't touch that, Tails!&quot; Sally cautioned.  &quot;We don't know
<br />
WHAT it is yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Awwww.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, honey, let's see where Antoine and Bunnie went
<br />
to,&quot; Sally said as she guided Tails out of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic opened the envelope and looked at the letter inside by the
<br />
light of the power stone.  &quot;Hey, Rotor, this is from Uncle Chuck!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, right.  Maybe I'd better see what the others are
<br />
doing,&quot; Rotor said as he walked out of the room, figuring that
<br />
Sonic would want to read the letter in private.  Sonic began to
<br />
read:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIE,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF YOU ARE READING THIS, YOU'VE DISCOVERED SOMETHING I
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WAS WORKING ON FOR YOU BUT WASN'T GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNTIL YOU HAD COME OF AGE.  I SUPPOSE I SHOULD BE CROSS AT
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU FOR FINDING THIS, BUT I KNOW HOW UNSTOPPABLE YOU CAN BE.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS DEVICE HARNESSES ENERGY FROM A POWER STONE AND
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONVERTS IT INTO A PORTABLE FORM; I CALL IT A 'POWER RING.' 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THESE RINGS ARE USELESS TO ANYBODY BUT YOU; THE OUTER CASING
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAN RECOGNIZE YOUR GENETIC CODE JUST BY COMING IN CONTACT
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WITH YOUR SKIN.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT EFFECT THE RINGS WILL
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HAVE ON YOU; I HOPE IT WILL BE SOMETHING BENEFICIAL.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AS PUNISHMENT FOR FINDING THIS MACHINE AHEAD OF TIME,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;YOU OWE ME 100 CHILI DOGS -- YOU KNOW HOW I LIKE 'EM.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LOVE,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UNCLE CHUCK.&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sonic thought as he wiped away the tears that had
<br />
built up, &quot;with extra onions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at the ring at his feet.  It gave off a strange
<br />
glow but didn't look all that remarkable.  He bent down to pick
<br />
it up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as he did, he felt something -- almost like a wave
<br />
of some sort -- shoot through him.  It was as if something inside
<br />
the power ring had found its way into every cell of his body at
<br />
once.  It was a sensation he'd never felt before, and it was
<br />
wonderful.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool!&quot;  He had to show this to the others.  Holding onto
<br />
the ring, he walked through to where the others had gone.  He
<br />
then noticed that the front door was open.  Through the door, he
<br />
could see Sally and Tails with their backs to him.  They appeared
<br />
to be standing on the sidewalk in front of the house.  He stepped
<br />
through the door into the night.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, guys!  Check this....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stopped.  He could now see that the others stood huddled
<br />
in a small group on the sidewalk, surrounded by four SWATbots
<br />
with blasters at the ready.  Sonic could sense another SWATbot
<br />
just behind him.
