<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was raining.  It had been raining hard for several days, and
<br />
there was no sign that it would let up any time soon.  Deep in the Great
<br />
Forest at Knothole Village, there was little or no activity.  Most of the
<br />
creatures stayed indoors and out of the rain.  Tails lay in bed.  The
<br />
coldness and dampness had gotten him a small cold.  Consequently, he was
<br />
under Sally's orders to stay in bed and rest.  Fortunately, he seemed to
<br />
be getting better, and soon he would be well again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in Robotnik's territory, at the capital of Robotropolis, all
<br />
operations had slowed to a crawl.  Due to some crafty sabotage on the part
<br />
of the Freedom Fighters, Robotnik's main rain shields were disabled and
<br />
much of his city was shut down.  At the main control center in the middle
<br />
of the city, Dr. Robotnik sat in his large chair gazing at the status
<br />
screens on the wall.  What he saw was not good.  If something wasn't done
<br />
soon, the entire city would be completely malfunctioning.  As he sat
<br />
watching the screens, a short, nervous looking man entered the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dr. Robotnik,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's chair turned around so he could face the small man.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Report, Snively,&quot; said Robotnik
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The repairs on the rain shield are nearly completed,&quot; said Snively
<br />
&quot;We should have them fixed within the hour.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; replied Robotnik &quot;How long before Robotropolis is up
<br />
and running?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We should be back to full operational status within three days.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik turned back to the screens and was silent for some time
<br />
before continuing. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me again Snively,&quot; he said &quot;How is it that Sonic was able to
<br />
disable our shields?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively shuffled his feet nervously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Didn't you say something about weak security?&quot; said Robotnik in a
<br />
strangely calm voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes sir,&quot; replied Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There must be some way to neutralize that pesky hedgehog!&quot; said
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If I may offer a suggestion sir,&quot; said Snively as he walked over
<br />
to the main control panels.  He typed in a few commands and the pictures
<br />
of two individuals appeared on the screen, Princess Sally and Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unlike us,&quot; said Snively &quot;the hedgehog has people that he cares
<br />
for.  If we could get our hands on either of them, we could use them to
<br />
keep the hedgehog at bay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik was not impressed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me Snively,&quot; said Robotnik &quot;how do you propose to do that? 
<br />
Princess Sally is not easily caught off guard when she comes here to
<br />
sabotage my city, and the small fox hasn't even been seen outside The
<br />
Great Forest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We could send spies into the Great Forest and catch them when and
<br />
where they least suspect.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik thought about this for a moment.  Then, an evil smile
<br />
came across his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent!&quot; he exclaimed &quot;Dispatch the Stealth-bots immediately!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Knothole Village, the rain was beginning to subside. 
<br />
Tails, who had been feeling better as of late, was sitting in bed trying
<br />
to convince Sally to let him go out and play. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I feel fine Sally,&quot; Tails was saying &quot;honest.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, who was sitting beside his bed wasn't buying it. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You may only think you're feeling better,&quot; she said &quot;but you
<br />
haven't fully recovered.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes I have,&quot; said Tails. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought for a moment. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right,&quot; she said &quot;If you feel as good tomorrow morning, then
<br />
you can go outside.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails hugged her &quot;Thank you Aunt Sally!&quot; he exclaimed. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now I think you better get some more rest,&quot; she said &quot;If you're
<br />
going to be well enough to go out tomorrow, you'll need rest.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails laid down and closed his eyes.  Within minutes, he was
<br />
sleeping peacefully. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally got up carefully and left the room.  As she walked down the
<br />
hall, she met Sonic who was going to see Tails. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's the big guy doing?&quot; he asked. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's feeling better,&quot; Sally said &quot;He thinks he's well enough to go
<br />
outside, but I told him to wait until tomorrow.  He's sleeping right now
<br />
so don't bother him.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right,&quot; replied Sonic &quot;I'm sure he'll be all right tomorrow.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sonic was speaking, three Stealth-bots, Robotnik's silent
<br />
robotic aircraft, were cruising at a low altitude over The Great Forest
<br />
scanning for Tails and Sally. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, as Tails thought, he was feeling better, and
<br />
Sally gave her grudging permission for him to go outside.  As she watched
<br />
Tails run out into the surrounding forest, Bunny Rabbot came up beside
<br />
her. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you think he'll be all right?&quot; Bunny asked. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hope so,&quot; replied Sally &quot;Still, I think I'll ask Sonic to keep
<br />
an eye on him today.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That would be a good idea,&quot; Bunny said &quot;In fact, there he is now.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was walking toward them while talking with Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sonic,&quot; Sally called. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good morning ladies,&quot; replied Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good morning,&quot; replied Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; said Sally &quot;could you do me a favor and watch Tails today
<br />
and make sure he's all right.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing,&quot; answered Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good,&quot; said Sally &quot;If his cold acts up again, I'd like someone
<br />
watching him.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, a scream split the air.  All present recognized Tails'
<br />
voice screaming for help.  Immediately, they rushed off to the direction
<br />
of the screams.  They soon arrived at a clearing where they saw a
<br />
Stealth-bot carrying off Tails in one of it's robotic arms.  Sonic was the
<br />
first to race after it, and the others followed.  Suddenly, another
<br />
Stealth-bot swooped down from the sky toward the group, dividing them in
<br />
all directions.  Meanwhile, Sonic, who had been racing after the first
<br />
Stealth-bot, was almost in range of jumping up and catching the
<br />
Stealth-bot.  However, he wasn't looking where he was going and crashed
<br />
into a tree. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the clearing Bunny, Rotor, and Sally were trying to
<br />
regroup and retreat, but, before anyone knew what happened, a Stealth-bot
<br />
sped down out of the air and caught Sally in it's robotic arm.  Sally
<br />
struggled to get free, but the Stealth-bot was to strong.  All of the
<br />
Stealth-bots, with Tails and Sally in their custody, sped back to
<br />
Robotropolis with all speed. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny and Rotor caught up to where Sonic was recovering with his
<br />
encounter with a tree.  Sonic was sitting next to the tree holding his
<br />
head.  He looked up as the others approached and asked them what happened. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Stealth-bots got Tails and Sally!&quot; exclaimed Rotor &quot;They've
<br />
taken them back to Robotropolis.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic jumped up in alarm and made ready to race after them, but
<br />
Rotor held him back. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know you can't go to Robotropolis,&quot; said Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And why not?&quot; snapped Sonic &quot;They just ran off with two of our
<br />
best friends!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You need a power ring first,&quot; answered Bunny. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic knew she was right, but he still grumbled about it as they
<br />
walked back to Knothole to break the news to the rest of the Freedom
<br />
Fighters. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ivo Robotnik was sitting in his big chair in the main command
<br />
center looking quite pleased with himself.  Snively had just brought him
<br />
the news that Tails and Sally had been captured and had just arrived at
<br />
Robotropolis.  He was looking out the window at what he called a
<br />
wonderfully polluted city. He was trying to think of all the ways he would
<br />
be able to control Sonic now that two of Sonic's friends were now in his
<br />
possession.  The door to the command room opened.  Robotnik turned to face
<br />
who he knew was coming. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Tails were being carried into the control room.  Each
<br />
one was in the tight grip of a Swat-bot.  Tails was near petrified with
<br />
fear.  Sally, who usually kept a cool head, was looking about her to try
<br />
to find a way to escape.  As soon as she saw Robotnik, she did not
<br />
hesitate to protest. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll never get away with this Robotnik!&quot; she exclaimed &quot;If you
<br />
think for one instant that whatever plan you have will work, you are
<br />
sorely mistaken!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think not my dear girl,&quot; Robotnik said &quot;This time, I shall see
<br />
to it that Sonic never finds you.  Surely you know that, as long as I have
<br />
you two as prisoners, Sonic will have to do everything I say.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The least you could do is let him go,&quot; said Sally, indicating
<br />
Tails &quot;He's just a child!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All the more reason for me to keep him,&quot; said Robotnik as he
<br />
walked over to the petrified Tails and patted him on the head &quot;I know how
<br />
much this young one's life means to Sonic.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you hurt that fox,&quot; Sally warned &quot;so help me I'll see to it
<br />
that you severely regret it!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik turned towards Sally. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are hardly in a position to make threats of any kind.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked up at the Swat-bots. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take these two to the transport shuttle,&quot; ordered Robotnik &quot;I'll
<br />
be there shortly.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two Swat-bots carried Sally and Tails from the room.  As they
<br />
were leaving, Sally heard Robotnik say &quot;We'll see what some time in
<br />
Ironlock prison does to them.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's mad laughter could be heard throughout the entire
<br />
building. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Power Ring were probably the most unusual thing to be
<br />
invented.  Sonic's uncle, Professor Charles Hedgehog, had developed the
<br />
technology shortly before Robotnik's invasion.  A few months before the
<br />
invasion, Charles placed a device that automatically constructed power
<br />
rings at the bottom of a small, deep pool of water near Knothole Village. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was now pacing back and forth next to that same pool,
<br />
waiting for a ring.  Ring construction was extensive and the device could
<br />
only turn out one ring every eight to twelve hours.  Strangely enough
<br />
Sonic was the only creature that could use the power in a ring.  When he
<br />
held one, he was able to run at just over Mach one.  Normally his top
<br />
running speed was only two hundred and fifty MPH. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pool suddenly started to glow. Sonic stopped pacing and
<br />
waited.  A large glowing ring levitated up out of the pool and hung in mid
<br />
air.  Sonic grabbed it quickly.  He could feel it's immense power rushing
<br />
through him.  Not one to waste time, he quickly charged off to
<br />
Robotropolis.  He exceeded Mach one in less than ten seconds. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic arrived at Robotropolis in three minutes, and forty-five
<br />
seconds.  Sneaking into the prison block was not going to be easy.  Sonic
<br />
stealthily sneaked through the city.  As he approached the prison block,
<br />
he heard a shuttle taking off and looked up.  A large subtle was taking
<br />
off from the main control center.  Sonic dismissed it as another transport
<br />
ship off to mind it's own business.  Sonic continued his search for Sally
<br />
and Tails.  The shuttle coasted through the air. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On board the shuttle, Robotnik was gloating to Snively about how
<br />
well his plan was succeeding.  In the back of the shuttle was a small cell
<br />
in which was Sally and Tails.  Tails was beginning to come out of his
<br />
fearful trance and was now trembling uncontrollably.  Sally held him close
<br />
to her, trying to comfort him.  After a time, he slowly calmed down and
<br />
stopped trembling.  Sally found that he had fallen asleep.  Sally
<br />
carefully laid him down on the bench she was sitting on and rested his
<br />
head on her leg.  As she sat there listening to the soft roar of the
<br />
shuttle engines, she wondered how Robotnik could be cruel enough to make a
<br />
child go through this.  She looked down at Tails and saw him cough in his
<br />
sleep.  She dismissed it as the result of all the pollution in the air,
<br />
but something in the back of here mind vaguely suggested that it might be
<br />
something more. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shuttle continued its journey toward Ironlock Prison. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Knothole Village, Sonic had just come back from
<br />
Robotropolis.  He was quite upset that he hadn't found any sign of Sally
<br />
or Tails.  Sonic decided that his next move should be to go ask Bookshire
<br />
if he knew where the pair might be. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire was an unusual person.  He lived near the northern most
<br />
edge of Knothole Village.  His main interests were in computer and medical
<br />
technology.  The thing that made him such an asset to the rebellion
<br />
against Robotnik was that he had established a link between his computer
<br />
and the Robotropolis Main Computer Core.  This provided much information
<br />
about almost any aspect of Robotnik's operations.  Sonic, along with Bunny
<br />
and Rotor arrived shortly at Bookshire's residence.  The middle-aged
<br />
raccoon welcomed them and asked what he could do for them. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally and Tails have been kidnapped by Robotnik,&quot; said Sonic &quot;We
<br />
want you to find out where he's taken them.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come in then,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;I'll see what I can do. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He led the three down into his home which he had constructed just
<br />
under the surface.  They went into his computer room where Bookshire sat
<br />
down in front of the computer and turned it on.  After some initial button
<br />
pushing, Bookshire switched the computer into voice activation mode so he
<br />
could speak directly to it. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; he said &quot;access Robotropolis Main Computer Core using
<br />
Cryptosmasher software.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer contacted the RMCC and quickly broke through the
<br />
encryption security lockouts.  It then displayed The RMCC main menu of
<br />
operations. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, determine security level for information regarding the
<br />
location of prisoners.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Access to Robotropolis Prisoner Status Files requires Level One
<br />
Priority Clearance,&quot; said the computer. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can such clearance be forged through the use of any code-breaking
<br />
software in your memory?&quot; asked Bookshire. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Affirmative,&quot; replied the computer &quot;with a probability of being
<br />
discovered of sixty-eight percent.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What does that mean?&quot; asked Bunny. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It means that we need to fake and access code to get into these
<br />
files,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;and there's a sixty-eight percent chance that
<br />
Robotnik's security programs will catch us and lock up the system.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well I think that that's a risk we have to take,&quot; said Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;Computer, attempt access of said
<br />
files.  Upon access, search for information regarding Princess Sally and
<br />
Tails.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer screen was suddenly filled with incomprehensible data
<br />
as the computer attempted access.  Shortly, the main menu for the prisoner
<br />
status files appeared.  The computer then searched for the requested
<br />
information. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are no files on record for Princess Sally or Tails,&quot; said
<br />
the computer. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; said Sonic, annoyed &quot;What do we do now?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;apparently they're not being kept in
<br />
Robotropolis.  What we have to do now is figure out where they could have
<br />
been taken.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And how are we supposed to do that?&quot; asked Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire thought for a moment. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; he said &quot;exit Prisoner Status Files and access records
<br />
for all transports departing Robotropolis in the last twenty-four hours.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer quickly carried out the command. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There have been 297 recorded departures from Robotropolis.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Which transports were transporting prisoners?&quot; asked Bookshire
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No transports were reported with prisoners.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That would make sense,&quot; remarked Bookshire &quot;I guess Robotnik
<br />
didn't want anyone to know where they were taken.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Sonic got an idea. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe we could find out if any of the transports were destined for
<br />
other prisons,&quot; he said. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great idea!&quot; exclaimed Bookshire &quot;Computer, how many of the
<br />
previously mentioned transports were destined for any known prison?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Transport NO. 14578-K5-78598-B departed Robotropolis Main Control
<br />
Center at 1100 hours today. Reported destination:  Ironlock Prison, Pilot: 
<br />
Swat-Bot #457-S, Passengers:  3.S
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ironlock Prison!&quot; exclaimed everyone. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Bookshire &quot;Now you know where they are.  Perhaps it
<br />
would be in everyone's best interests if you were to go get them.  Now!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This broke the others from their stunned trance.  They thanked
<br />
Bookshire and immediately raced off to Ironlock prison. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ironlock Prison was one of the oldest structures on the planet. 
<br />
It had been built in 1593 near the very heart of the Dark Swamp.  It was
<br />
used for over 300 years until it was abandoned in 1894.  Now, the old
<br />
building was crumbling, but there were still some parts that were still
<br />
intact.  One of these parts was a small cell block on the fifth level that
<br />
was, at that moment, being guarded by ten Swat-bots.  In one of the cells
<br />
was Princess Sally and Tails. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was lying, trembling on what was left of the bed.  He was
<br />
getting sick again.  Sally had done just about all she could think of to
<br />
comfort him.  She had covered him with an old blanket she found in the
<br />
cell, but it was getting colder and colder as night started to set in. 
<br />
Being unable to think of much else to do, she sat down next to him and
<br />
started singing something soothing.  She had been singing to Tails for
<br />
some time before she was interrupted when she noticed Robotnik standing at
<br />
the bars. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What a lovely singing voice you have Princess,&quot; remarked Robotnik,
<br />
smiling &quot;Perhaps you would be good enough to sing for me once.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was appalled at the mere thought. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your dreams, Doctor,&quot; snapped Sally. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Too bad,&quot; replied Robotnik &quot;I just stopped by to see if you are
<br />
enjoying your new home.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd rather see you behind bars Robotnik,&quot; said Sally &quot;How can you
<br />
be so cruel as to lock up a sick child!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik smiled. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just another part of my wonderful personality I guess,&quot; he said. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When Sonic finds us, he'll make you regret the day you were born!&quot; 
<br />
exclaimed Sally. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think not my dear girl,&quot; said Robotnik &quot;He has no idea where you
<br />
are, and even if he did, my Swat-bots will handle him.  In the meantime,
<br />
enjoy your stay.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik chuckled to himself as he walked away. Sally turned back
<br />
to the sleeping fox and felt his forehead.  It was extremely hot.  Sally
<br />
was getting more and more worried that, if help didn't come soon, it would
<br />
come too late.  She began to sing to Tails again as night fell into place. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Bunny, and Rotor arrived outside the main gate of Ironlock
<br />
Prison shortly after eight o'clock.  It wasn't going to be easy getting in
<br />
there.  Carefully secluded behind some trees, the three planned their next
<br />
move. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There are four Swat-bots guarding the main gate,&quot; said Bunny &quot;How
<br />
are we going to get past them?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe we won't have to,&quot; said Rotor &quot;If any of the stories I've
<br />
heard about this place are true, there are at least three secret entrances
<br />
to this place.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trio moved silently through the surrounding swamp until they
<br />
arrive at a small pond. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think there should be a tunnel into the prison at the bottom of
<br />
this pond,&quot; said Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll go down and have a look,&quot; replied Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic dove into the murky water.  Although he could barely see, he
<br />
was able to make out a dark tunnel near the bottom.  He swam back to the
<br />
surface. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I found it,&quot; he told the others &quot;let's go.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny and Rotor dove in and followed Sonic down through the water
<br />
and into the tunnel.  Just as they were about to run out of air, they
<br />
surfaced in a dark cavern.  As they climbed out of the water Rotor pulled
<br />
out his flashlight. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't think any living thing has been in here for ages,&quot; 
<br />
remarked Bunny. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're probably right,&quot; said Sonic &quot;Let's get going.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three proceeded down the dark cavern.  It was some time before
<br />
the cavern opened out into an abandoned corridor somewhere deep inside
<br />
Ironlock. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor pulled out a scanner he had brought with him and swept the
<br />
area. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think I have something,&quot; he said &quot;I'm reading two life forms
<br />
about five floors above and to the northwest of us.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then let's get going,&quot; said Sonic impatiently. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The three moved up the prison as fast as they could go.  When they
<br />
reached the fifth level, it was crawling with Swat-bots.  They moved
<br />
silently down a corridor and peeked around the corner.  One of the cells
<br />
down the next corridor was guarded by a bunch of Swat-bots. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's gotta be where they are,&quot; whispered Sonic &quot;you guys wait
<br />
here, and I'll handle the Swat-bots.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic raced out of hiding, and, before the Swat-bots could react,
<br />
he leaped into a Sonic-spin and tore through each and every one of them. 
<br />
When he finished they were nothing more than piles of metal.  Rotor and
<br />
Bunny came out of hiding as Sonic opened the cell door. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!&quot; exclaimed Sally &quot;Am I ever glad to see you.  Tails got
<br />
sick again and its even worse than before! We've got to get him out of
<br />
here!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny came in a gently picked up the still trembling fox in her
<br />
arms. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alright,&quot; said Sonic &quot;we gotta find a quick way out of here.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I saw a patrol craft in the courtyard as we came up,&quot; 
<br />
said Rotor. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great, &quot;said Sally &quot;If it's still there then we're in business.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran down to the courtyard as fast as they could.  As they ran
<br />
out into the yard, a loud alarm sounded.  The were momentarily startled,
<br />
but they quickly snapped out of it as the yard began to fill with
<br />
Swat-bots.  Sonic ran ahead and destroyed the two bots guarding the craft. 
<br />
the group barely made it inside when the bots opened fire on the craft. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunny laid Tails down on one of the benches as Rotor began to try
<br />
the controls. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You do know how to fly one of these don't you, Rotor,&quot; asked
<br />
Sally. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh...I think so,&quot; said Rotor as he flipped various switches. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEDGEHOG!&quot; bellowed a deep voice from somewhere outside. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'd do extremely well to surrender now, hedgehog,&quot; said Robotnik
<br />
&quot;we have you completely surrounded.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your dreams, Robuttnik!&quot; yelled back Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just then, Rotor hit the vertical thrusters and the craft shot
<br />
straight up for over a mile.  Suddenly it stopped. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; said Rotor, visibly shaken &quot;I think I got it.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The trip home was somewhat shaky, but everyone survived.  After an
<br />
examination, Bookshire reported that they got Tails home in time and he
<br />
would be okay.  Three weeks later, Tails and Sally were back having the
<br />
same conversation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I feel fine Sally,&quot; Tails was saying &quot;honest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, who was sitting beside his bed wasn't buying it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You may only think you're feeling better,&quot; she said &quot;but you
<br />
haven't fully recovered.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes I have,&quot; said Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not this time, Tails,&quot; said Sally &quot;Now I think you should get some
<br />
sleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aw, Aunt Sally, &quot;began Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, Tails&quot; said Sonic from the doorway &quot; if you go to sleep
<br />
now, when you're well, you can go on a race with me through the forest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails didn't need a second invitation.  He laid down in his bed
<br />
and went to sleep.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Sally and Sonic had left the room, Sally turned to him. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You definitely seem to have a way with children,&quot; said Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I understand children real well,&quot; Sonic boasted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Takes one to know one, right,&quot; said Sally. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right,&quot; said Sonic&quot;...hey, wait a minute!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally burst out laughing. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's not funny, Sal,&quot; said Sonic. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure it is,&quot; replied Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was about to say something else, but he started laughing
<br />
too.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pair walked through Knothole playfully making fun of each
<br />
other as night once again closed in on the Great Forest.  
<br />

<br />
THE END
<br />
