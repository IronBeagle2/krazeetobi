<br />
Part 4.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Freedom Fighters had to choose their missions carefully.  They 
<br />
didn't have the supplies nor the people to pursue a war with reckless 
<br />
abandon, and because each mission involved a huge amount of risk, they 
<br />
had to make sure that what would occur if they were successful was worth 
<br />
it.  If they were successful.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A while back, Bookshire and Rotor had managed to force a link to 
<br />
the Robotropolis Main Computer Core, but even with that source of 
<br />
information, they had to be cautious.  Packbell, Robotnik's android 
<br />
commander, knew of the link, and was constantly planting false 
<br />
information in the computer files, hoping to trap the Freedom Fighters.  
<br />
It was false information that had led to a failed mission where Bunnie 
<br />
was partially roboticized.  That was not something the Freedom Fighters 
<br />
wanted to have happen again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, however, there was enough reliable information to be had, and 
<br />
Sally decided it was time for another mission.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That evening, all who would be involved with the mission were 
<br />
gathered in Sally's hut to go over what would take place.  There was 
<br />
Sally, Sonic, Bookshire, Bunnie...and Tolouse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tolouse were the last ones to appear.  As they stepped 
<br />
through the doorway, Tolouse saw the somber expression on everybody's 
<br />
face, and he knew it was for real this time.  He sat down in a chair 
<br />
offered to him, breathing deeply in an attempt to calm his nerves.  
<br />
Sonic sat next to him, and then the room quieted as Sally got up to give 
<br />
the details of the mission.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She set Nicole down on the table and said, &quot;Nicole, display the 
<br />
coolant treatment plant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The small computer beeped in reply, and soon a holographic 
<br />
projection of one of Robotnik's city structures was floating in front of 
<br />
the gathering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stood beside it.  &quot;According to information Bookshire was 
<br />
able to retrieve, all of Robotnik's factories use a coolant system to 
<br />
keep the machines from overheating.  However, the coolant formula that 
<br />
he uses is very unstable, and must be constantly recycled.  Here,&quot; Sally 
<br />
pointed to the hologram, &quot;is where that takes place.  If we succeed in 
<br />
disabling the treatment plant, all of Robotnik's factories will be off 
<br />
line, until he gets the plant repaired or rebuilt.  This means there 
<br />
will be less opportunity for him to search for Knothole and other forest 
<br />
refugees, which means we have succeeded in buying valuable time.&quot;  She 
<br />
hesitated before saying softly, &quot;Time that could quite possibly allow us 
<br />
to find a way to beat him once and for all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cleared her throat and continued in a normal voice.  &quot;The plant 
<br />
follows a schedule.  Every day of the week coolant is brought in from 
<br />
different parts of the city for treatment and recycling.  We've found 
<br />
out that many of the factories that normally have their coolant recycled 
<br />
tomorrow are undergoing reconstruction, so this is our best opportunity 
<br />
to disable the plant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, here's the plan:  I will see to any security measures that 
<br />
need taking care of, and Tolouse will be with me, standing guard and 
<br />
helping if necessary.  Once I give an okay, Sonic and Bunnie will go 
<br />
inside and plant the explosives.  Any questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were none.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.  Sonic, Bunnie, I'm sure I don't have to tell you that even 
<br />
though the plant won't be as busy as normal, there will still be worker-
<br />
bots and Swat-bots all throughout the plant.  Please be careful.  And, 
<br />
Tolouse...&quot;  Sally smiled.  &quot;This will be your first time going with us 
<br />
to Robotropolis.  Are you ready?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse tried to remember a time when he felt more scared, and he 
<br />
did.  He had been four years old, and he and his mother were fleeing 
<br />
Mobotropolis.  But, this was what he was here for.  &quot;Yes.  I am.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded.  &quot;Good.  Okay, everybody, try and get some sleep.  
<br />
We...have a long day set for tomorrow.  Good night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all got up and gave their polite good-byes.  As Tolouse 
<br />
approached the door, he was tapped on the shoulder.  He turned around, 
<br />
and saw Sonic.  &quot;Well, bud, this is it.  How ya feelin'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was not going to lie.  &quot;Scared as heck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic nodded.  &quot;You'd be crazy not to.  Don't worry too much, 
<br />
though.  After all,&quot; Sonic elbowed Tolouse's side, &quot;you got the *easy* 
<br />
part.  Just stand beside Sally and look around.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse swallowed, trying not to sound too uncertain.  &quot;Okay.  I'll 
<br />
do my best.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the spirit, bud.  Okay, go home, get some rest.  Big day 
<br />
tomorrow.&quot;  Sonic waved good night, and Tolouse waved in return.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse spent most of the night lieing in bed, wide awake, thinking 
<br />
of his mother and the rest of the underground villagers, thinking of his 
<br />
new friends at Knothole, and thinking of tomorrow's mission.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is it.  Here we go...
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early the next morning, the mission began.  Sonic did his usual 
<br />
service as transportation, and soon they were all standing in the junk 
<br />
yards outside of Robotropolis.  After that, they walked towards the 
<br />
treatment plant.  Soon, the plant was towering above them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally handed Sonic and Bunnie com-links and pointed to the rubble 
<br />
of a collapsed building.  &quot;You two hide over there until while I figure 
<br />
out a way in.  Tolouse, follow me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally spent the next few minutes looking over the outside of the 
<br />
structure, hoping to find a way in that would allow for the least amount 
<br />
of tinkering with the security systems.  Tolouse followed closely, ready 
<br />
to do anything he was told.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ivo Robotnik sat in his command chair, drumming his fingers as 
<br />
if he were bored.  Snively, of course, knew better.  Whenever he saw 
<br />
Robotnik like this, it was usually soon followed by Robotnik jumping out 
<br />
of his chair as if struck by some great inspiration, and soon yet 
<br />
another factory or another technologically-wonderful toy or another 
<br />
fearce weapon to be used against the Freedom Fighters was being built.  
<br />
Well, Snively thought to himself with sarcasm, the old goon will be 
<br />
*quite* happy with this latest development.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it, Snively?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am pleased to report, sir, that the factories you requested 
<br />
additions to...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes?&quot; Robotnik interrupted, leaning forward.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;They have been finished ahead of schedule, sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik stood up, excitement coursing through him.  &quot;That is 
<br />
wonderful news, Snively.  Well, get them running!  Establish the links 
<br />
to the power generators, the water plants, the coolant plant...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Preparations are being made, sir,&quot; said Snively, feeling more 
<br />
arrogant with each passing moment.  As if *I* need to be told how to run 
<br />
these things...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent, Snively,&quot; Robotnik said, rubbing his hands together.  
<br />
&quot;This is turning out to be a fine day...&quot;  He looked at Snively.  &quot;Well?  
<br />
Carry on!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.&quot;  Snively turned on his heel and walked out of the room.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was hiding in the rubble, keeping his eye on the treatment 
<br />
plant and the area surrounding it.  Sally had found a way in, and now, 
<br />
Sonic and Bunnie were somewhere inside, while Sally stood watch near 
<br />
their make-shift entrance.  Provided that all went as planned, the only 
<br />
thing left for Tolouse to do was to wait until all three of them 
<br />
returned to the rubble.  Of course, it was also his mission to warn them 
<br />
should anything approach the plant, even though there was not supposed 
<br />
to be activity until later in the day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse yawned and rubbed his eyes.  When he opened them again, 
<br />
again, he saw three tankers making their way to the plant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, gods!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He quickly pulled out his com-link and said into it, &quot;Guys, there's 
<br />
some tankers coming to the plant!  They're coming from the...&quot;  Tolouse 
<br />
paused to look around and remember his directions.  He never got a 
<br />
chance to decide on the right one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;FREEZE, PRISONER!&quot; Tolouse heard a robotic voice say.  He spun 
<br />
around and saw a Swat-bot holding a laser rifle to his head.  He froze, 
<br />
the com-link slipping out of his hand and clattering on the concrete 
<br />
below.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Swat-bot called to another bot, and soon Tolouse was being 
<br />
escorted to the prison block.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The com-link left behind came to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, repeat that...Tolouse?...oh gods, Tolouse...?  Bunnie, 
<br />
Sonic, abort the mission.  Let's get out of here!&quot;
<br />

<br />
