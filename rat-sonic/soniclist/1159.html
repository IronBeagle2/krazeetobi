-&gt;       Has anyone tryed to start a petition to make them create more
<br />
-&gt; cartoons? Hey, with a little work we might get the cartoon back!
<br />

<br />
Well that wouldn't be possible.  For one, Sega cancelled the contract after
<br />
DIC started to sell some animation stills from the show and that got
<br />
Sega P.O.ed. Also robotnik bit the dust at the end of the show. Now that
<br />
wouldn't be too much of a problem. I am trying to write a story where
<br />
robotnik comes back in a way that sounds like something they would do in
<br />
Jurassic park.  OOPS I SAID TOO MUCH ALREADY!
<br />

<br />
-&gt;       Oh, are the novels any good? Er, novellas....are there any
<br />
-&gt; NOVELS?
<br />
-&gt; 100 pages is a little short for me. And I haven't seen any graphic
<br />
-&gt; novels, are there any out there?
<br />

<br />
I think they are 100 page books with some pictures. I have also seen a
<br />
book that was made for younger kids. It's a really short book like a
<br />
picture story book. Forget what it was called.
<br />

<br />
Also if they can't get the TV show back why not they get Time Warner to
<br />
get rights form Sega and Archie to make some Audio plays like they make.
<br />
I have heard a few of TWs Audio Plays before and they do a good job.
<br />
What i was thinking is they could get the cartoon cast back together to
<br />
preform some of the Comics
<br />

<br />
-&gt;       A person was asking for help with a game. Where on the net is
<br />
-&gt; this
<br />
-&gt; game? I need directions.
<br />

<br />
Ok it's a service called Furtooia. I had the Telnet adress somewhere
<br />
here but can't find it right now. I have it on my EWAN program so i can
<br />
try thst. Here is what i remember
<br />

<br />
Telnet to  red_panda.tbyte.com port 9999
<br />
logon as a guest they will tell you how
<br />
ring for a help wizard online to let you out of the guest room
<br />
tyoe out till your outside ofthis big tree
<br />
type taxi then gfo
<br />
then type d
<br />
your in Knothole!
<br />

<br />
-&gt;       One last question, how old is Antoine?
<br />
-&gt; -
<br />
Well in the episode Blast from the Past they have him with the rest of
<br />
the kids. I whoud guess he is about the same age as Sonic and Sally
<br />

<br />
Hope that cleared some things up
<br />
