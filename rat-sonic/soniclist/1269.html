#21 [Apr 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;3 Phases of E.V.E&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/Spaziante
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik unleashes E.V.E. [&quot;exceptionally versatile
<br />
evolvoid&quot;] to capture Sonic.  As Sonic manages to outsmart
<br />
E.V.E., it simply adapts to another form to compensate.  Sonic
<br />
lures it to Robotnik's headquarters where, assuming a
<br />
self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it is being held back
<br />
by its biological inheritance from Sonic and Robotnik [i.e.,
<br />
individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation].  E.V.E. toasts
<br />
Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by Sonic--apparently,
<br />
Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) -- E.V.E. spares
<br />
Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
<br />
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
<br />
tease--stay tuned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
<br />
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary by Ron Bauerle
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species!&quot; written by Mike Kanterovich &amp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ken Penders, art by Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so
<br />
far and describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is
<br />
renouned for his military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps
<br />
Sally's meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.  Sally &amp; Geoffrey
<br />
are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the facility and manage
<br />
to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their private lives out
<br />
of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the process (I can't
<br />
call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic either).  They
<br />
then head back to the camp where some young trainee freedom
<br />
fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey mistakes them for
<br />
enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're separated by Sally. 
<br />
This establishes some bad blood between Hamlin and Geoffrey that
<br />
continues all issue.  The team proceeds to its next target (an
<br />
energy substation) and after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage
<br />
to destroy it.  During the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life
<br />
but Hamlin still doesn't trust him.  That night, when everyone
<br />
else is asleep, Geoffrey slips away, activates a teleportal,
<br />
enters some kind of building and descends to its basement where
<br />
he speaks to a figure in a  glass case: Sally!?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also some fan art: two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie (both NBD),
<br />
and one of Sally as a dominatrix (!).
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
#22 [May 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Return&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Penders/Spaziante &amp; Harvey M.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The story opens with Sonic &amp; Sally MCW (Married with
<br />
Children; cf. the end of &quot;Sally's Quest&quot; in _In Your Face #1_). 
<br />
Sonic &amp; Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning
<br />
storm, an apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly
<br />
disappears.  Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and
<br />
follow the remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a
<br />
satellite talking with Robo-Robotnik from &quot;Night of a Thousand
<br />
Sonics,&quot; (#19), only in this case only the consciousness of
<br />
Robo-Robotnik (hereinafter &quot;R-R&quot;) remains resident.  Robotnik
<br />
convinces R-R to teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out
<br />
Snively has activated an alternative Doomesday device which would
<br />
go off if Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually
<br />
deactivates &quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; himself to keep from being
<br />
ruler over nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic:
<br />
&quot;You owe me!&quot;  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a
<br />
stalemate.  What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by
<br />
Spaziante artwork.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails Knighttime Story,&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak &amp; John Dagostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Tails grumps about &quot;get[ting] baby-sat&quot; while Sonic has
<br />
all the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story
<br />
wherein Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who &quot;borrows&quot;
<br />
his armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned
<br />
knight, ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia
<br />
(guess who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two
<br />
letters pepper them with questions (most are answered: &quot;Keep
<br />
reading.&quot;  Translation: &quot;we're working on it!&quot;).  The cover of
<br />
Princess Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one
<br />
which appears on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the
<br />
&quot;creative differences&quot; theory in Q7.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Miniseries #2 [May 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;: Part 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
<br />
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
<br />
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
<br />
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
<br />
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
<br />
volunteers to stay with him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
<br />
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
<br />
leaving, they find that Arlo and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
<br />
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
<br />
opposed).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
<br />
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
<br />
Sally to Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears): Will Sonic and
<br />
Sally marry? &quot;Could be.&quot;  Has Sally met Knuckles?  She will in a
<br />
forthcoming 48-page S&amp;K special.  Does Sally have a mother, and
<br />
if so what does she look like? &quot;Of course...her origin may yet be
<br />
told.&quot;  Or [shameless plug] you can read about it in &quot;Bloodlines&quot;
<br />
in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.
<br />

#23   [Jun 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all
<br />
captured by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In
<br />
order to save Robotnik from &quot;disposal,&quot; Sonic convinces Car-Heem
<br />
that they are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous
<br />
Car-Heem.  Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape
<br />
their confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although
<br />
Robotnik blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's
<br />
airlock, Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns
<br />
everyone to Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants
<br />
of his ant farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun
<br />
which I'm not going to reveal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vol-ANT-teer&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails'
<br />
lost backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just
<br />
in case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
<br />
isn't exactly clueless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
<br />
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
<br />
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
<br />
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sally Miniseries #3  [June 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species, Part III&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
(Summary: James Firmiss)
<br />
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
<br />
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
<br />
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
<br />
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
<br />
Sally rescues him.  They eventually reach their objective, break
<br />
down the doors and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the
<br />
container).  Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps
<br />
him.  Sally breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the
<br />
same side.  Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a
<br />
perfect robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the
<br />
defense system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the
<br />
freedom fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being
<br />
built.  Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to
<br />
him by St. John.  Robotnik begins the roboticization process but
<br />
the chamber blows up because a &quot;feedback loop&quot; has occurred. 
<br />
Something which is impossible unless...he were trying to
<br />
roboticize a robot!  The real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
<br />
Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
<br />
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
<br />
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
<br />
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
<br />
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
<br />
&quot;moles&quot;.  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
<br />
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
<br />
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
<br />
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
<br />
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
<br />
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
<br />
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
<br />
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
<br />
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
<br />
serious lip-locking before they part.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
<br />
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
<br />
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
<br />
leader of the &quot;Rebel Underground&quot; and acted as a double agent in
<br />
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
<br />
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
<br />
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
<br />
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
<br />
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
<br />
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
<br />
was an automated Sally:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the real Sally always called him &quot;Mr. St. John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
<br />
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
<br />
replaced by a robot double.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
<br />
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
<br />
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
<br />
unexpected happened.
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
<br />
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats....&quot;  JF
<br />

<br />

<br />
Day, and expresses the desire to be her boyfriend.

#24  [Jul 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When Hedgehogs Collide&quot; (in 4 parts)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich
<br />
Koslowski (Parts 3 and 4)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
<br />
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
<br />
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from &quot;The Good, The
<br />
Bad and the Hedgehog&quot; [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
<br />
&quot;the Antisonic,&quot; as in &quot;the Antichrist&quot;) is looking for some
<br />
action, so he rounds up the &quot;gang&quot; consisting of the Antisally,
<br />
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
<br />
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
<br />
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
<br />
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot; though they were unable to penetrate &quot;the Zone
<br />
of Silence&quot; (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
<br />
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
<br />
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
<br />
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
<br />
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
<br />
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
<br />
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
<br />
strategies.  So it's &quot;Change partners!&quot; as play is resumed: Sonic
<br />
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
<br />
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
<br />
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
<br />
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
<br />
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
<br />
peacefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
<br />
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
<br />
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
<br />
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
<br />
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
<br />
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
<br />
the work and &quot;kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!&quot;  At least,
<br />
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
<br />
to...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a &quot;Sonic + Bunnie&quot; graffiti
<br />
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sally,&quot; &quot;Sonic + Nicole&quot;--THAT I'd like to see!--and &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sonic&quot;], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
<br />
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
<br />
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
<br />
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
<br />
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
<br />
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
<br />
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGram: information on two upcoming &quot;special&quot; issues: the
<br />
48-page Sonic &amp; Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
<br />
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island; and
<br />
the &quot;Silver Anniversary&quot; issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
<br />
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of &quot;Do-It-
<br />
Yourself Sonic Contest&quot; winners who have moved and left no
<br />
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
<br />
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles 48 page special [1995]
<br />
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Panic in the Sky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney (Part 1), Manak (Part 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobians living on the western shore of &quot;the Great
<br />
Continent&quot; [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
<br />
another adjective besides &quot;Great&quot;: viz.: the Great Forest, the
<br />
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the &quot;all-purpose&quot;
<br />
use of the word _hrair_, or &quot;thousands&quot; by rabbits in Richard
<br />
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
<br />
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
<br />
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
<br />
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
<br />
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
<br />
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
<br />
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
<br />
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
<br />
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
<br />
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
<br />
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
<br />
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
<br />
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.  
<br />
It appears that Robotnik is &quot;hijacking&quot; the island by somehow
<br />
draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps the island
<br />
afloat.  Already having established a presence on the island,
<br />
Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans to use
<br />
the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole.  Knuckles
<br />
won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes the Chaos
<br />
Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik abandons it,
<br />
expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole (though how he
<br />
suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).  But Knuckles
<br />
replaces the &quot;real&quot; Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd tell you how
<br />
he switched it with a phony one which was the one he broke, but I
<br />
don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an invitation to
<br />
join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of the island now
<br />
involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
<br />
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
<br />
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
<br />
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
<br />
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
<br />
island.  Must be Nack the Weasel -- check out the SonicGram in
<br />
issue #23 for a hint.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patroling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
<br />
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
<br />
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
<br />
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
<br />
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
<br />
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
<br />
Knuckles' exit line: &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect
<br />
and serve!&quot;  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
<br />
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
<br />
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
<br />
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
<br />
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
<br />
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
<br />
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
<br />
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
<br />
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.
<br />

<br />
#25  [Aug 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go Ahead...Mecha My Day&quot; (the only story in this issue)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Gallagher
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
based on summary by James Firmiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
<br />
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a &quot;zone portal.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
<br />
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
<br />
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
<br />
terms: &quot;Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice.&quot;
<br />
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
<br />
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
<br />
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
<br />
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
<br />
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
<br />
much of a bustline in issue #21!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
<br />
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
<br />
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#26 [Sep 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Way, Way Past Cool&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
<br />
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
<br />
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
<br />
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
<br />
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
<br />
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
<br />
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
<br />
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
<br />
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
<br />
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
<br />
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
<br />
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has inspired renewed argument over species
<br />
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
<br />
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
<br />
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
<br />
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
<br />
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
<br />
expect?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
<br />
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
<br />
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
<br />
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
<br />
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
<br />
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
<br />
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
<br />
would ordinarily avoid water?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan art
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fortified&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
<br />
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
<br />
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
<br />
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
<br />
forge.  Robotnik's &quot;bus&quot; crashes into the fort, only to confront
<br />
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
<br />
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
<br />
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
<br />
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in &quot;Vol-Ant-eer&quot; in Sonic #23
<br />
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
<br />
her a little on the &quot;squashed&quot; side.  After Spaziante's rendering
<br />
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone
<br />
and Pauley [DJD: Leave it at the water cooler, guys!].  Hint that
<br />
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
<br />
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
<br />
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
<br />
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
<br />
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of &quot;total destruction&quot; don't
<br />
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
<br />
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
<br />
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple
<br />
Trouble special.

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
<br />
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
<br />
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
<br />
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
<br />
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
<br />
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
<br />
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
<br />
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
<br />
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
<br />
address is princess_at_frdmftrs.org ?
