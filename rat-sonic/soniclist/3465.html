<em class="quotelev1">&gt;job at it. Here, i'll give you a full refund.
</em><br />

<br />
Oh, I see.  You can do whatever the hell you feel like to me, and I gotta
<br />
keep my yap shut and take it from you?  Well, sorry, I don't allow people
<br />
to treat me in that way for very long.  It's obvious that you won't,
<br />
either.  
<br />

<br />
And I know it's so bloody hard to maintain one of these things, too.  I
<br />
used to run several remailers on a Freenet (this one, in fact) with no
<br />
shell access and only a .forward file that had to be manually edited 
<br />
when I wanted to add a new user.  Often, I'd have to transfer a file
<br />
sent to myself to the list due to misdirection on the part of the user.
<br />
You, on the other hand, have a totally automated remailer that you
<br />
occasionally take control of when someone spams it.  -You- have absolutely
<br />
no day-to-day need to operate the thing, and you don't even do it yourself.
<br />

<br />
Anyway, Ratman, where'd the rest of my post go?  No comments on it?  No 
<br />
denials about what I said?  Absolutely nothing to add besides the
<br />
below thug-like threat and sneer?  Not even a `I did not'?
<br />

<br />
Somehow, Ratman, I expected you to behave in this way.  You never were
<br />
the type to sit down and discuss an issue rationally, were you?  Nay, 
<br />
it's either you're right or everyone else is wrong.  God forbid you
<br />
might consider the shades of gray.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I tell ya, I appreciate you making it easier for me to shut this thing down.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I felt kinda bad about it, but this helps make me feel better about it. 
</em><br />

<br />
Do you enjoy making other people suffer, Ratman?  Apparently, you take
<br />
great pleasure in watching those of us who loved this list twist in the
<br />
wind while you dangle the sword of Damocles over this forum.  
<br />

<br />
Needless to say, you've made it far easier for -me- to motivate my
<br />
friends to start up a new mailing list.  After all, next to the fear
<br />
of death, rage is the second best motivational tool.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;And if this &quot;rat bashing&quot; becomes a trend, I think i'd like to shut it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;down right now. I'll see how it goes today and tomorrow.
</em><br />

<br />
How do you sleep at night, Ratman?  Can you honestly say to me that hurting
<br />
so many other people is not a problem for you?  Perhaps that MK crowd
<br />
of yours has zeroed your empathy levels...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But I'd rather give it the full week for people to say their goodbyes, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and possibly advertise for other forums people can use to discuss Sonic.
</em><br />

<br />
It's too late to apply damage control, Ratman.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;So yes, this is my frigging mailing list dammit, I'm not about to sit by and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;watch people band together to say what a jerk I am. You can't tell me you
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wouldn't do the same thing. 
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, I wouldn't be taking away the list in the first place.  I'd
<br />
just let it fix itself, eventually.  And if that didn't work, I'd help
<br />
to start a thread that would get people's minds back on-topic.
<br />

<br />
Also, Ratman, I'd sit and take my medicine for my past misdeeds, rather
<br />
than editing them all away and trying to shift the blame onto someone
<br />
else.  If -I- thought someone had said something bad about me, I'd take
<br />
issue with them in a logical, scientific fashion, proving that what the
<br />
other person(s) said was incorrect.
<br />

<br />
In closing, if this be the message that stopped this list prematurely, so 
<br />
be it.  It will only make my resolution to win a new list stronger.  I
<br />
will not cowtow to you again.
<br />

<br />
Joe.
