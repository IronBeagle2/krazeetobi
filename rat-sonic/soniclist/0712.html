&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog Story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 11
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You need to work on your party manners, Robuttnik!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik turned around.  Standing just behind the rank of
<br />
SWATbots at his back, as if he'd materialized out of thin air,
<br />
stood Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sugarhog!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Business before pleasure, I'm afraid: GET THAT HEDGEHOG!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an instant, the Chase was on.  Sonic never really
<br />
admitted it to anyone but this was not only what he was best at,
<br />
but what he lived for.  Running for running's sake was a rush,
<br />
but to pour it on as fast as he could while staying one
<br />
split-second ahead of Robotnik's SWATbots--he never tired of it. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, he never took risks without a reason...at least,
<br />
that's what he told Sally whenever she'd scold him for his
<br />
reckless conduct.  Even now his dashing about the chamber had a
<br />
purpose.  It kept Robotnik and his SWATbots from focusing their
<br />
attention on a service duct near the ceiling.  It was the duct by
<br />
which he had entered the room.  And it was from this duct that a
<br />
long strip of black cloth now hung down.  It was Sally's bakhat,
<br />
and Sally was rappelling down it to the floor of the room.  In a
<br />
second, she was undoing the restraints on Sandy and Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How'd you find us, Sally-girl?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck picked up a dispatch call for SWATbot
<br />
reinforcements.  Now come on,&quot; she urged, &quot;we've got to get out
<br />
of here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But once Sandy was freed from the restraint, she shoved
<br />
Sally to the side, drew a third knife that had been concealed in
<br />
her boot, and ran straight for Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one of the SWATbots had detected her sudden movement. 
<br />
It only took the bot a second to lock onto Sandy and fire.  The
<br />
blast hit her in her right arm.  Crying out in pain, she fell to
<br />
the floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SANDY!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Bunnie dashed to Sandy's side while Sonic got
<br />
right in the SWATbot's face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, that's no way to treat a lady!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The taunt worked; the SWATbot's attention was back on Sonic
<br />
and away from Sandy, who was being helped up to a kneeling
<br />
position.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My arm!&quot; she gasped.  &quot;Can't move it.  Blast must have
<br />
shorted it out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you stand?&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't think so.  Feels like it weighs a ton!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's it, Sandy-girl.  You are out of the game!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with that, Bunnie used her own robotic arm to toss Sandy
<br />
over her shoulder like a sack.  With the helpless Sandy in tow,
<br />
Bunnie and Sally headed for the bakhat and began climbing, while
<br />
Sonic continued to use a combination of speed and taunts to keep
<br />
Robotnik and his SWATbots occupied.  So consuming was Robotnik's
<br />
hatred for Sonic that he had no idea that his other prisoners
<br />
were escaping.  Finally, Sonic came to ground at the far end of
<br />
the room, away from the magnet.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Man, you're slowin' down, Robobreath!  Want me to be your
<br />
personal trainer?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hedgehog, you've been a nuisance for far too long.  It
<br />
isn't worth it for me to roboticize you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never would've figured you for the compassionate type.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So I've decided that I'm just going to have to kill you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa, right the first time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The half dozen SWATbots all drew a bead on Sonic as Robotnic
<br />
stepped behind them.  &quot;Any last requests, rodent?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about two seconds, Sonic seemed nonplussed.  That was
<br />
all the time he needed to sum up the situation.  From where he
<br />
stood, he could see that Bunnie and Sandy were now safely inside
<br />
the conduit.  He could also see Sally just inside the duct,
<br />
holding onto the bakhat as if ready to give it a pull.  Sonic
<br />
followed it down to where Sally had apparently tied it off, and
<br />
the old hedgehog smirk was back in place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I got a request: smile for the camera!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that, Sally gave a pull on the bakhat...which she had
<br />
tied to the power switch of the electromagnet.  It started to hum
<br />
to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NOO!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It only took a second for the magnet to warm up and begin
<br />
pulling Robotnik toward it.  In that one second Sonic had gone
<br />
into a Sonic spin, skittered up the wall and across the ceiling,
<br />
entered the duct, and was exchanging a high-five with Sally just
<br />
as Robotnik slammed into the magnet.  Followed by a half-dozen
<br />
SWATbots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Snively!!  Cut off the power!!  Get me out of here!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But by the time Robotnik had been freed, Sonic and the
<br />
others had safely disappeared down the miles of ducts and
<br />
conduits of Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be concluded
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
