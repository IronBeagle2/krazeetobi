<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was near dusk when they found a site that would serve as a
<br />
suitable shelter for the duration of their stay, however long it
<br />
would be.  It was a cavern located about fifty km inland from
<br />
the carbonate mud pit.  It had a few of the amenities of modern
<br />
life:  a bath (subterranean lake), water from the stream that
<br />
fed the lake, and beds (unusual calcium carbonate cave
<br />
formations that were actually soft enough to sleep on).  All
<br />
that remained was one problem:  food.  There was nothing
<br />
available besides the native plants, and they were officially
<br />
declared unfit for consumption by Nicole.  They did have ration
<br />
packs, but those were nearly completely consumed before the
<br />
incident in the canyon.  All they could do at this point is
<br />
conserve their energy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the endeavor to keep them distracted from their gastronomic
<br />
requirements, Sonic and Sally took a bath to rinse the mud off,
<br />
and talked about anything in general for a while.  They also
<br />
reviewed the data regarding the temporal displacement device and
<br />
the other hardware in the probe.  Sonic tried to be as
<br />
accommodating as possible, trying not to interrupt when a new
<br />
piece of technobabble surfaced.  Sally appreciated this act
<br />
forwarded by the normally impatient and disinclined hedgehog.
<br />
In return, she tried putting in a little more explanation into
<br />
the more difficult concepts so that she and Sonic would
<br />
understand them.  Whether Sonic acted this way out of kindness
<br />
or for another motive wasn't clear.  What was clear was that
<br />
they were both in the same situation, and teamwork would be
<br />
their only savior.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As time slowly progressed on for the two surviving Freedom
<br />
Fighters, they learned a great deal of information about the
<br />
temporal displacement device.  However, none of the data was
<br />
actually useful in the field combat sense.  More data had to be
<br />
searched through to find something they could utilize. That was
<br />
until an hour before midnight, when something caught Sally's eye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Sally said, &quot;I think I've found something that might
<br />
get us back to our time period.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog replied patiently, &quot;As I say to Bunny, 'I'm all
<br />
ears.'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally then continued with the description.  &quot;According to this,
<br />
we can return to our own time period by applying an inverse
<br />
temporal entry vector utilizing the same level of power that was
<br />
used by the device to send us here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic thought that statement over.  He stood up, apparently
<br />
tired of sitting while contemplating the issue.  &quot;Let me get
<br />
this straight, Sal,&quot; he hazarded.  &quot;If we go back through that
<br />
time hole with the same amount of juice that got us here, we get
<br />
back to our time?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly, Sonic,&quot; Sally confirmed.  &quot;I'm already working on
<br />
calculating what power level the device used to bring us here.&quot;
<br />
To Nicole, she asked, &quot;Nicole, what is the absolute time
<br />
differential from previous readings?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Calculating, Sally,&quot; Nicole answered.  &quot;Absolute temporal
<br />
displacement:  three billion, 800 million, 200 thousand, 906
<br />
years, two months, five days, ten hours, five minutes, thirty
<br />
seconds.  Readings based on prescaled data.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hedgehog wasn't exactly aware as to why that level of
<br />
accuracy was required.  He made his point audible.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In order to get back to our time,&quot; Sally explained, &quot;we need
<br />
to know exactly when it was we were transported here.  If the
<br />
wrong level of power is given on the return trip, we may find
<br />
ourselves before or after the time we want to go back to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How does power on the return relate to the power the time
<br />
machine used?&quot; Sonic asked thoughtfully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;According to the data, the power response is linear.  That is,
<br />
the power differential relative to what the device used would
<br />
send us before or after the event took place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So that means if I give it more juice than the device used, we
<br />
could go back in time to before we were sent here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right,&quot; Sally said.  She was about to continue, but she
<br />
paused, thinking about what observation Sonic had made.
<br />
Slightly surprised by his proposal, she said, &quot;Sonic, you want
<br />
to go back to the time before we were sent to this time period?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Correctomundo, Sal,&quot; he confirmed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But why?&quot;  Sally was somewhat puzzled by the hedgehog's choice
<br />
of tactics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sonic's turn to explain his rationale.  &quot;Let me put it
<br />
this way, Sal,&quot; he began, pacing as he spoke, like a professor
<br />
teaching a class.  He amplified his voice, speaking to the
<br />
cavern at large, to give his statements an ominous sound to
<br />
them.  The cavern's acoustics provided the perfect response.
<br />
&quot;There's still too much we don't know about that time machine
<br />
that even the info Nicole got can't tell us.  We don't know if
<br />
it was an experimental wartoy or otherwise, and billions of
<br />
other things that might affect how well it works.  Another is
<br />
that thing's old beyond belief.  We don't have a clue to how it
<br />
reacted after 'Buttnik fired it, and this hedgehog ain't willing
<br />
to bet on something being stable for that long.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought the point over, and concluded that Sonic could be
<br />
right about the temporal displacement device.  Considering the
<br />
matter further, if they did go back in time to the right hour or
<br />
even minute, there might be enough of an opportunity to destroy
<br />
the machine before Robotnik had the chance to use it himself.
<br />
The key was to find the right time, and go back to it so that
<br />
they could perform the necessary destructive acts.  One thing
<br />
remained burning away in her mind, though.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There's just one thing though,&quot; Sally stated, &quot;if we go back
<br />
in time to a point before we were sent here, we wouldn't exist
<br />
after a while.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Say what?!&quot; exclaimed the confused hedgehog.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, Sonic.  I didn't mean that the way it sounded,&quot; she
<br />
apologized.  &quot;What I meant was that WE, the you and I here,
<br />
would cease to exist at the time when Robotnik engaged that
<br />
device.  The 'other' us, the Sonic and Sally in sync with time
<br />
back in the past will live.  They, I mean we, just won't
<br />
remember what happened.  If we're successful this time around,
<br />
it would be to our other selves like the entire incident never
<br />
happened.  You and I would have destroyed the device, so the
<br />
other us would never be sent to the future.  Do you still want
<br />
to go back before Robotnik used it against us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a chance we'll have to take, Sal.  If we go back to when
<br />
Robotnik sent us here, we'd just end up in that beam again.  And
<br />
if we go after, that thing might blow up in our face.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right, Sonic,&quot; she finally said after scheming over the
<br />
proposed plan.  &quot;Going back before Robotnik got his hands on it
<br />
and used it against us would be the best idea I heard all day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Sal.  Remember this:  the Hedgehog is always right.&quot;  He
<br />
dictated this teasingly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally retorted in kind.  &quot;Since when?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic responded with a glare, but they both knew it to be
<br />
mocking only;  not a real threat.  Sally responded with her own
<br />
glare toward Sonic.  Mutually disarmed, they surrendered to
<br />
laughter and embraced each other for a while.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realizing that the technical discussion of time and space had
<br />
purged more energy out of them than expected, they went to
<br />
sleep.  The next morning would be the day of the great escape
<br />
from this future time period, in the hopes of creating a better
<br />
one in the past.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the two companions in time went back to the
<br />
temporal singularity for the final preparations on their return
<br />
trip.  Along the way, they discussed and decided when to return
<br />
to, and what power level was needed.  While walking through the
<br />
mud pool, they both tripped over rocks hidden under the opaque
<br />
layer of shell and other carbonate excretion products.  This
<br />
eventually covered them in mud from their head to their feet,
<br />
making the journey even more difficult since they were partially
<br />
blinded by the mud caked over their eyes.  But they managed to
<br />
trek on.  Within about two hours, they managed to arrive at the
<br />
temporal singularity site.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where's it at, Sal?&quot; Sonic inquired, quickly scanning for
<br />
their passage to home.  &quot;I can't see it out there anywhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally handed a pair of multispectrum goggles to him and
<br />
responded, &quot;Here, try these on, Sonic.  I've modified them to
<br />
detect temporal distortions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic retrieved the goggles, put them on his face, and searched
<br />
the area again.  &quot;Got it,&quot; the hedgehog said to his comrade when
<br />
he located the singularity thirty meters ahead of them.  &quot;Cool.
<br />
You got the juicing limit set, Sal?  That might've been the
<br />
mistake we made the last time we tried this,&quot; he said not
<br />
without some concern.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technically, Sonic was incorrect in his last statement.  From
<br />
the viewpoint of Mobius' past, this would be the first time that
<br />
they executed this plan.  However, now wasn't the time to argue
<br />
the finer points of temporal physics.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yep, already done.  Twelve megawatts exactly,&quot; Sally verified.
<br />
&quot;Just remember this,&quot; she admonished, &quot;we need to go DIRECTLY
<br />
into the temporal singularity.  Otherwise...&quot; she trailed off,
<br />
not inclined to think of the consequences.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There wasn't any need for further discussion on this particular
<br />
subject.  It had been covered before.  They both knew that if
<br />
Sonic didn't enter the singularity perpendicular to its event
<br />
horizon, the best that could happen is that they could be
<br />
transported anywhere in time, without their discretion.  The
<br />
worst case, they could be trapped in the singularity for all
<br />
eternity.  No margin for error existed here, and everything
<br />
depended on Sonic's concentration and undeviating stability to a
<br />
path.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With nothing further to review or to prepare for, they began
<br />
Phase 1:  powering for time transport.  Sonic reprogrammed the
<br />
goggles to display only the areas of the strongest temporal
<br />
displacement potential and added a target sight centerlined for
<br />
him, for that indicated the correct path to vector into.  Sally
<br />
got behind him, gripping his back with all the strength she had.
<br />
She pulled the power ring out of his backpack, and he assumed
<br />
his stance to engage the power transfer.  An energy field formed
<br />
around the hedgehog,  gradually becoming more powerful and
<br />
displacing the mud around his feet as he concentrated on
<br />
generating the required energy to travel over 3.8 billion years
<br />
into the past.  Nothing else existed in his mind;  only the
<br />
power ring field mattered now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole was programmed to emit an audible signal when the
<br />
detected power field reached the preset energy level.  No
<br />
indication tone came from the little computer.  Sonic was
<br />
straining to his limit to generate the power field, but he
<br />
needed a little more encouragement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally noticed the hedgehog's predicament, and tried to motivate
<br />
him on further.  &quot;Sonic, you can do it.  I know you can.
<br />
Concentrate harder.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His only response was to strengthen the energy level in the
<br />
power field.  About five seconds later, Nicole gave the signal
<br />
they were waiting for.  He halted his energy demands from the
<br />
power ring, but maintained the power field surrounding him and
<br />
Sally.  Sonic then lowered his field of vision and centered his
<br />
target sight on the strongest area of temporal displacement.
<br />
After obtaining the desired target, he maintained his aim, and
<br />
fired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Phase 2 had begun.  Sonic covered the thirty meter distance to
<br />
the temporal singularity in a microsecond, his velocity warping
<br />
the volume of air around the energy field into an intense shock
<br />
wave cone.  Sonic entered the temporal singularity perfectly,
<br />
and remained on course back to the other opening in time and
<br />
space.  All that remained now was to traverse the
<br />
incomprehensible span of time back to the device and the person
<br />
responsible for their troubles.
