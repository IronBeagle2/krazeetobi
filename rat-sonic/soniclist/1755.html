<br />
Since we've been talking about copyright issues and such I'm sending this
<br />
article I came across recently. According to the place I got it from its a
<br />
story out of the Hollywood Reporter.
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Even Genie never imagined Aladdin exploring &quot;A Whole New World&quot; from his
<br />
knees on a magic carpet behind a naked Jasmine.
<br />
Nor did Steven Spielberg envision one of his furry femal Tiny Toons
<br />
characters attracting a mate from out of her species.
<br />
But those and dozens of other highly professional-looking pornographic
<br />
variations of popular animated characters from Disney, Warner Bros, and
<br />
Paramount movies, NBC, Fox and Hanna Barbera TV shows, video games and
<br />
comic books are posted on a World Wide Web site on the Internet.
<br />
While some of the drawings simply feature characters such as Ariel of &quot;The
<br />
Little Mermaid,&quot; Marge Simpson, Josie and the Pussycats and Babs Bunny in
<br />
the nude or Als and Scooby Doo getting excited by naked women, others are
<br />
more explicit. For instance, Babs is featured in various drawings
<br />
masturbating while reading a copy of &quot;Huge Dudes&quot; magazine and engaging in
<br />
sex with Buster Bunny and other characters.
<br />
In fact, Warner Bros. &quot;Tiny Toons,&quot; created by Spielberg, is the subject of
<br />
many of the drawings, one of which features new lyrics to the show's theme
<br />
song under the new title &quot;Teeny Toon&quot;: &quot;We're hot and we're horny, we're
<br />
showing kniderporny...&quot;
<br />
Studio officials at Disney, Warner, and Paramount were all unfamiliar with
<br />
the site when contacted on Tuesday, but all said that copyright issues are
<br />
routinely turned over to the legal department. None would comment on the
<br />
possible illegality of the drawings.
<br />
A source at Warners said the company has been notified of similar
<br />
situations on the Internet over the past year or two.
<br />
Owen Sloane, who specializes in entertainment law for Berger Kahn of Marina
<br />
del Rey, said that there is a certain amount of lee way regarding the use
<br />
of copy righted characters when lused for satire.
<br />
But there are limitations relative to interfering with the valule of the
<br />
character, he said.
<br />
Although he did not see the drawings, after listening to a descripiton from
<br />
a reporter he said as the images could have a damaging effect on the
<br />
characters themselves, &quot;There are probably copyright problems here.&quot;
<br />
However, he said that so far companies have not been aggressive about
<br />
policing the Internet. &quot;Most of the time Internet issues are not worth
<br />
pursuing because the distribution is small and it has little impact.&quot;
<br />
Mark Hilts, vp of Servic Tech, a Rochester, NY based Internet service
<br />
provider for the site said he was unaware of the nature of the content on
<br />
the site. He said he would check with lawyers right away and if it was
<br />
clearly illegal or porographic the site owuld b terminated. &quot;If it's
<br />
clearly illegal or porno graphic in any way, it will be terminated,&quot; Hilts
<br />
said.
<br />
However, he added, &quot;Everyone's idea of pornography is different.&quot;
<br />
Hilts would not divulge the name of the ownere of the site. E-mail to the
<br />
site went unanswered Tuesday.
<br />
Although the familliar charcters are featured in soft-core and hard-core
<br />
porno9graphic postions and settins, most of the drawings are signed, such
<br />
as one in which a Tiny Toons character is depicted performing felation on a
<br />
horse.
<br />
Directory pages that categorize the drawings by studio indecate that
<br />
although the drawings are based on copyrighted characters, the modifeid
<br />
pictures are &quot;fan art&quot; and may be distributed freely.
<br />
The site also warns users that the pictures are of an adult nature and &quot;not
<br />
a place to shop around for the kiddies.&quot;
<br />
