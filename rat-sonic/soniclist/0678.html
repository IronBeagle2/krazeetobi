<br />
Temporal Notice:  The story takes place approximately 4.5 weeks
<br />
after David's activation, about a week after Tails and David
<br />
became brothers by Knothole Law.  Refer to &quot;My Brother's Keeper&quot;
<br />
for background details.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saturday morning at 0630 hours was one of dazzling beauty for
<br />
the denizens of Knothole.  The solar system's star exhibited an
<br />
excellent act around this time of day, some say specifically for
<br />
Mobius.  The eastern sky exploded into a shower of colors along
<br />
the sky, displaying all the primaries and further in the visible
<br />
light spectrum.  The shower of light continued its advance
<br />
gradually toward the west, forcing the darkness from its
<br />
stronghold back toward the other time zones in the west.
<br />
Although most of the play in the stage of the sky was partially
<br />
obscured by the branches and the leaves of the tree covering and
<br />
surrounding Knothole, there were small panoramas in some areas
<br />
that permitted the actors to be seen as the colors intermingled
<br />
and separated in complex patterns.  Views like this allowed the
<br />
Freedom Fighters of Knothole to enjoy waking up at this time of
<br />
day.  All except one Freedom Fighter in particular.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Normally, David wouldn't be in such a somber mood, in perfect
<br />
contrast to the gaiety of the day.  He had much to appreciate,
<br />
for he had accomplished much over the past four weeks as a
<br />
compuorganic vulpine.  For starters, he had become comrades with
<br />
the rest of the Knothole residents in general, his most
<br />
important and recent acquirement being Tails.  After a legal
<br />
settling held by Princess Sally, plus overwhelming support from
<br />
the rest of Knothole constituents, David and Tails were brothers
<br />
by Knothole law.  By mutual agreement between David and Tails,
<br />
the two foxes decided to live together in Tails' hut.  The
<br />
vulpines received a bunk bed courtesy of Rotor, and recognizing
<br />
David as a kindred inventor, the walrus permitted David the
<br />
privilege of collecting whatever raw materials he needed from
<br />
Rotor's junk equipment shed.  The compuorganic fox replaced or
<br />
installed many of the computers in Knothole by permission with
<br />
ultramodern-designed units, including the computers in Sally's
<br />
hut, the observatory, Reconstruction Hall (formerly the War
<br />
Room), and of course, his and Tails' hut.  Sally even allowed
<br />
him to modify Nicole's circuitry, and she received a faster,
<br />
more efficient computer in the process.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from the external accomplishments, David kept his nanites
<br />
and circuits (electronic and organic) under intensive labor for
<br />
improving and designing the complex proactive conjunction of
<br />
systems that formed his physical and mental matrix.  Over a
<br />
short period of time, he complied a massive level of data for
<br />
his behavior subroutines, allowing him to interact with the rest
<br />
of the Freedom Fighters on a personal level.  The
<br />
positronic/organic clock speed and instruction execution level
<br />
increased geometrically by every second.  His organic/electronic
<br />
visual circuitry gradually expanded their encroachment into the
<br />
electromagnetic spectrum, progressing beyond IR and UV.  These
<br />
and other countless upgrades were a source of personal pride to
<br />
David.  Yet with all these achievements, the compuorganic
<br />
vulpine was still troubled on what would otherwise be an
<br />
delightful day for him.  In his place as a symbiotic marriage
<br />
between computer and organic systems, he had a unique look on
<br />
life that made him a honored Knothole member.  But he maintained
<br />
the mannerisms of a perturbed black and gray fox on this day,
<br />
for reasons that only he had awareness of.  His mind reviewed
<br />
the events of the past day:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yesterday morning, David was occupied in a conversation with
<br />
Sonic, for the purpose of analyzing his terminology and behavior
<br />
associated with his speech.  He attempted to mimic the
<br />
hedgehog's jovial attitude and language in order to find ways to
<br />
integrate them into his own developing styles, then a cascade
<br />
failure occurred in his universal translation language subunit
<br />
processor that rapidly extended into the other integrated
<br />
terminology system routines.  No audible sound emitted from his
<br />
mouth as he fell to the ground, convulsing as if he had an
<br />
epileptic attack.  He became unconscious before his impact with
<br />
the ground.  He awoke five minutes later in Rotor's workshop on
<br />
a improvised cot, finding many of his friends standing around
<br />
him, concerned for his welfare.  He explained to them that it
<br />
was a failure in one of his language subroutines that caused the
<br />
disaster, and assured them that the situation was under
<br />
stringent control.  Reluctantly, they released him from the
<br />
makeshift cybernetic/organic medical facility, thinking that
<br />
this would be the final encumbrance that David would face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David was wrong in his assumption.  For later in the day, when
<br />
the sun had completed its decent into the west horizon, David
<br />
was deep in the Great Forest for the purpose of essaying his
<br />
extended optical sensor array.  Without any warning, everything
<br />
except his visible light spectrum detection grids deactivated
<br />
simultaneously.  Unable to detect any recognizable forms in the
<br />
blackness, he engaged his electromagnetic navigation array.
<br />
That system crashed one second after he activated it.  He groped
<br />
around in the darkness for about two hours before Dulcy managed
<br />
to locate and retrieve him.  More scrutiny by his distressed
<br />
peers after his return to Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the rest of the day continued, David found many of his
<br />
systems either partially or thoroughly disabling themselves in a
<br />
random chain, and he had no means to limit or prevent the
<br />
effects.  By midnight, 40% of all his operational units were
<br />
radically affected.  David had no alternative except to reset
<br />
all his critical and minor functions and programs to their
<br />
default values, excluding his memory data core and emotional
<br />
database, which appeared to be the most stable remaining systems.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the functionally-deprived fox was afraid to even venture
<br />
out into public, for the dread that even his default codes would
<br />
fall victim to a possibly more dire cascade failures, possibly
<br />
leading to fatality.  He was at odds with the obligation of
<br />
informing Knothole at large what precisely was creating the
<br />
system-wide general protection faults in him.  Then again, it
<br />
was more than likely that what he felt was necessary to say to
<br />
his associates would only serve to aggravate the anxiety/stress
<br />
indicators higher than the level they were presently at.
<br />
Everyone had their own notions as to what was gradually
<br />
stripping David's modifications from his grasp, but he knew
<br />
exactly what the answer to the conundrum was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, David's systems were unable to dynamically respond to
<br />
his lofty demands.  His projected scope of improved designs were
<br />
too much beyond his compuorganic's form to compose and alter
<br />
for, since he was designed without consideration to what he
<br />
would wish to install by default.  The desire for excellence was
<br />
never even anticipated, especially not from David.  To extend
<br />
his hopes for functionality far over his predesigned
<br />
specifications would only be a lesson in futility.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A familiar voice from the bed above his called to him.  &quot;Are
<br />
you OK, David?&quot; his brother asked, regarding his irritated
<br />
facial expression.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David was unable to retain the truth, knowing that it would
<br />
have to be revealed eventually.  &quot;No, Tails, I am not,&quot; he
<br />
replied to his relative, speaking with his default value
<br />
terminology index and modified emotional subroutine, incapable
<br />
of cloaking the frustration from his vocalization.  &quot;Nearly all
<br />
of my systems are either reset to their initial values, or
<br />
disengaged from service.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What caused this to happen?&quot; the caring confidant continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David lifted himself from his bed and began pacing across the
<br />
floor, going to the ends of the bunk bed and repeating his
<br />
determined cadence.  &quot;I committed many severe errors,&quot; he began
<br />
with a voice close to cracking into uncontrollable weeping.  &quot;I
<br />
expected my compuorganic system to be capable of creating and/or
<br />
engaging in modifications to my components.  I desired
<br />
integrated devices and programs that were ultimately too far
<br />
beyond what I was expected to possess.  In the process, I
<br />
instructed my nanites to construct those circuits and organic
<br />
complexes until they nearly failed.  Critical protection faults
<br />
occurred, leading to random cascade failures.  The end result:
<br />
deprivation of nearly all the advantages I had.&quot;  By the end of
<br />
his monologue, he nearly was in tears.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, David,&quot; Tails said with more reassurance than he
<br />
felt, for he knew that his kin was in a severe predicament, and
<br />
he didn't have the knowledge of how to confront the situation.
<br />
&quot;You'll come out of it, and probably be able to get those
<br />
programs back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; David said determinedly, combating the stream of tears
<br />
that threatened to overtake his eyes and failing.  After
<br />
re-resonating his voice to a slightly more composed state, he
<br />
continued dictating.  &quot;The only alternatives I retain are to
<br />
maintain the default values and do nothing to alter
<br />
them.....or....&quot;  He stopped pacing, his face contorted with
<br />
concentration, due to the intensive data compiling and
<br />
resolution.  Tails bided his time for the resulting unspoken
<br />
alternative, knowing that David would eventually reveal the
<br />
thought to him.  &quot;Or,&quot; he finally said, &quot;completely redesign my
<br />
system to allow for a broad spectrum of hardware and software
<br />
modifications, reinitialize the codes, et cetera.&quot;  A new
<br />
expectancy arose from his decision, gradually becoming apparent
<br />
on his face.  His right arm partially extended, he pointed a
<br />
finger toward nowhere in particular.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His brother examined his face, saw the look of expectancy, and
<br />
the particular method that he utilized to point one specific
<br />
finger from his right paw off to an undefined point in space.
<br />
From the little bits of information that Tails knew about his
<br />
vulpine relative, he had enough experience with him to
<br />
understand what significance the facial expression and
<br />
positioning of the extremity indicated to Mobius at large.
<br />
David had found the reprieving point in his trials, and the
<br />
decision was final.  He had every intention of surpassing what
<br />
Rotor and Bookshire designed him to be, while maintaining the
<br />
basic intent of being a Freedom Fighter commander.  Nothing
<br />
would force him to deviate from his intended course now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yet,&quot; David spoke again, this time with a thoughtful
<br />
atmosphere, &quot;there are a great number of undefined parameters to
<br />
take into consideration.  What can I utilize to define my new
<br />
compuorganic system?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He noticed his personal computer, and walked to the touchpad
<br />
keyboard.  Not knowing what to expect next from the developing
<br />
situation, Tails followed.  After arriving at the required
<br />
position to use the keyboard, David typed in the required
<br />
security commands, answered the security coding vocally, and
<br />
received access to the servers available in Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer,&quot; David commanded, directing his request to the small
<br />
black tower case, &quot;access the Knothole Library Server.  Download
<br />
available on-line book titles only.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The computer complied with his request.  Less than one second
<br />
later, the book titles scrolled down the video display panel.
<br />
David pressed the appropriate keys on the video display to
<br />
examine the book titles.  The confusion of fastly-scrolled
<br />
titles made no sense to Tails, but he knew his brother would
<br />
have no difficulty interpreting the blurred wave.  David stopped
<br />
when he found a book that piqued his interest.  He pointed it
<br />
out to his bewildered relative.  The book was &quot;Profiles of
<br />
Mobian Predators&quot;.  He lightly tapped the display where the
<br />
title was visible, indicating it to the computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Download the indicated book for information, and display on
<br />
wall unit.&quot;  He and Tails then walked to the wall unit display,
<br />
where they could both have an extended field of view.  &quot;Display
<br />
speed, 1024 wps.&quot;  The computer scrolled the book down the
<br />
screen at the requested speed, and David read through its
<br />
entirety in six seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now that I have an approximation of what functions I require,&quot;
<br />
David finally stated, &quot;I need to design the basis for my system
<br />
frame.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you sure it's safe, David?&quot; Tails inquired, beginning to
<br />
seriously ponder the gravity of the task his vulpine familiar
<br />
was about to undertake.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The procedure is safe, Tails,&quot; the black and gray fox
<br />
responded.  &quot;Nothing will be overlooked or considered trivial.
<br />
The methods are POTENTIALLY life-threatening, but safeguards
<br />
have been implemented to make the risks highly improbable.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if to prove the point, David went back to his personal
<br />
computer.  Taking position in front of the keyboard, his paws
<br />
became a fury of motion as he entered the required codes to
<br />
manipulate the replicator, a modified roboticiser unit located
<br />
in Rotor's workshop.  After two minutes of entering complex
<br />
mathematical codes and programming procedures, David removed a
<br />
plastic object from a data access port in his computer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This polylinear chip,&quot; he said with unconfined fascination,
<br />
&quot;is the key to my artificial evolution.  Now I shall become the
<br />
model Freedom Fighter, and have no difficulty upgrading my
<br />
components and software.&quot;  He inspected the chronometer in the
<br />
wall display unit, saw that the time was 0641 hours.  &quot;However,&quot;
<br />
he continued, &quot;the passage to an improved form of life requires
<br />
energy, and I am currently unprepared for such an endeavor.&quot;  A
<br />
low, but audible noise originated from his abdominal area,
<br />
indicating mutual agreement between his digestive system and
<br />
power indicators.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the two foxes had consumed their fill of breakfast, they
<br />
traveled to Rotor's workshop for David's improved initialization
<br />
procedure.  They checked to see if the hut was currently under
<br />
use for another one of Bookshire's and Rotor's projects;  it was
<br />
not.  Without further delay, they walked inside, spending five
<br />
minutes assessing the preliminary diagnostics on the main
<br />
computer and replicator.  Satisfied with the results, David
<br />
instructed the main computer to reform him, utilizing the
<br />
parameters encoded on the polylinear chip.  Thirty seconds
<br />
later, the vulpine stepped into the replicator cylinder, and
<br />
disintegrated into a shower of dissociated subatomic particles.
<br />
The main computer began its most difficult assignment:
<br />
restructuring David without causing a fatality in the process.
<br />
Tails waited five minutes while the computer performed its
<br />
programmed duties, then saw his brother reappear in the
<br />
replicator container, particle by particle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looked significantly different compared to the fox that had
<br />
entered the replicator cylinder five minutes before.  His tails
<br />
seemed more muscular and powerful, capable of flight for longer
<br />
distances, and looked as if they could easily behead a SWATBot
<br />
and recycle a Hover Unit in no time at all.  The remaining
<br />
section of his endoskeletal frame was covered by a slimmer, but
<br />
equally devastating compuorganic overlay.  His cranial
<br />
attachment seemed to have decreased in volume at least 5%, from
<br />
the reallocation of raw materials to other areas in his body.
<br />
The advanced David had been designed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails was astounded by the renewed black and gray fox that
<br />
stood before him.  &quot;Is that you, David?&quot; he demanded for
<br />
identification.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His fox brother quirked his mouth, forming a smile.  &quot;Of
<br />
course, who else would I be?&quot; the relative replied, not without
<br />
a certain piqued resonance in his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Tails began, &quot;it's nice to see that you haven't lost
<br />
your sense of humor.&quot;  He investigated the schematic diagrams on
<br />
the computer.  &quot;What are these empty spaces for?&quot; he inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The voids in my body allow for growth of new components.  Now
<br />
I have the capability to construct and refine systems without
<br />
concerning myself with the threat of multiple cascade failures.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's statement was correct, for the re-initialization did
<br />
more than refine his more obvious external physical appearance.
<br />
His cognitive subroutines, instruction/clock speed, integrated
<br />
language routines, reaction timebases, nanites, and countless
<br />
other functions had been accelerated and/or rejuvenated.  The
<br />
new baselines allowed for new components in the future, which
<br />
would soon fill the cavities under his skin.  Now that he had
<br />
superseded his original design plans set by Bookshire and Rotor,
<br />
David was prepared for nearly anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revitalized fox stepped out from the replicator cylinder.
<br />
&quot;Tails,&quot; he said to his brother, &quot;I believe it is time to begin
<br />
the next phase of my directed evolution.  It is necessary for me
<br />
to exceed conventional velocities, so propulsion is the concern
<br />
now.&quot;  He stepped over to the main computer, and entered all the
<br />
appropriate security access codes for server connection
<br />
allowance.  &quot;Computer,&quot; he commanded after he was granted
<br />
access, &quot;connect to the Knothole Library Server.  Keyword:  FTL
<br />
propulsion.&quot;
<br />
