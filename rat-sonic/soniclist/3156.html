<em class="quotelev1">&gt;        Hrm...odd thing about Archie's ages--they maintain that Sally and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sonic are 15, but in the lead-in story to the Princess Sally miniseries,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we see a panel where her mentor (sorry--I don't have the issues with me 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; at the keyboard, and I can't remember the titles or names off the top of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; my head) mentions being at her commencement ball--and that same panel has 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sally dancing with Sonic. Unless Mobius uses a vastly different system 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; than Earth, shouldn't Sally be at least 16 (though I may be getting this 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 'commencement ball' confused with something else, I'm going on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; assumption that its the same thing as a debutante ball or a coming-out 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; party)?  All things considered, I'd put Sally and Sonic as being 19, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; maybe very early 20's, Antoine being maybe a bit older, Bunnie and Rotor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being a couple of years younger than S&amp;S, and Tails being about 13, given 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; actions and attitudes. How much time has passed between that ball and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; current day, anyway? For that matter, how long *has* it been since Robo 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; took over??
</em><br />

<br />
I've always had trouble with Julayla's comment about the &quot;commencement&quot;.
<br />
The only thing I can figure is that Kanterovich &amp; Penders must have
<br />
written it without reference to &quot;Blast To The Past&quot; which established
<br />
&quot;canonically&quot; that Sonic, Sally et al. were 5 when Robotnik took over in
<br />
3224 MA [Mobian Age].  That ep, plus &quot;Drood Henge,&quot; are pivotal in
<br />
establishing the Mobian timeline.  Archie, unfortunately, has never been
<br />
held to be as canonical as the SatAM series, and has had to play
<br />
catch-up ever since, even with regard to character modeling.  For the
<br />
longest time the Archie Sally was off-color [if you know what I mean]
<br />
and apparently based on the Sally that appeared only once, in the
<br />
off-model &quot;Heads or Tails&quot; ep from the first season.
<br />

<br />
Much as I'd want to put the gang toward the shank end of adolescence,
<br />
&quot;Drood Henge&quot; leaves it as unambiguous that they're in their mid-teens
<br />
and that Tails is a 10-year-old.  As for time, 3224 from 3235 makes it
<br />
11 years that Robotnik has been in business.  That makes it more
<br />
interesting for Tails, who would have been born within a year of
<br />
Robotnik's takeover and thus would never have known what Mobius was like
<br />
pre-Robotnik.
