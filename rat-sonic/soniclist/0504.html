<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I kinda suspected they were Knuckle's eyes.  That's how they kept doing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; ads for Sonic 3.  Besides...  We have't seen him either in the TV show.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Is it me or did Snivley curl his eyebrows after coming out of hiding?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
Okay, I'm feeling kinda sat 'bout this, and am prob'ly refusing to accept
<br />
reality, but has there been any OFFICIAL word as whether or not StH will
<br />
appear next season?
<br />

<br />
I know some of us have seen various articles and posts saying the worst, but
<br />
I was just wonderin' if ABC, DiC, or anybody else involved with the program
<br />
had mentioned anything.
<br />

<br />
Switching subjects (slightly) here, I'm remembering that message that someone
<br />
forwarded from r.a.a that was by one of the guys involved with the afternoon
<br />
cartoon.  It said that they did the whole she-bang in one year and apparently
<br />
have not done anything since.
<br />

<br />
Just for debate, I would think that creating a show in such a manner ought
<br />
to make it better, story-wise.  I mean, you start out knowing exactly how
<br />
many episodes there'll be, so you go about writing the story, start, middle,
<br />
finish, sorta like one long mini-series.  Then, in case you do in fact go
<br />
back to the studio, you can leave one little exit in the final episode to
<br />
continue with.
<br />

<br />
I believe this is how the original TMNT syndicated series was written, since
<br />
there actually were characters that came and went recurringly (assuming
<br />
you could find a TV station that would play them in order!), but apparently
<br />
this was not the case for TAoStH.
<br />

<br />
Again, just for debate, I ask the question:  What went wrong?
<br />

<br />
Well, you said it was a little quiet!
<br />
