<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But that isn't what these characters were created for. 
</em><br />

<br />
Who are we kidding? The characters were created for one purpose only: To
<br />
make money. When Sonic was first introduced back in '91, what do you think
<br />
the Sega executives were thinking about? How to create a cute, magical,
<br />
wonderful character in order to make the world a better place? I think not.
<br />
They wanted us to enjoy it, because: our enjoyment=their profits.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;How they act and what they do is entirely up to the creators of these
</em><br />
characters.  To fly off the
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;handle and have these characters doing what the authors never intended for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;them to do, and then try to cover it in the shroud of 'realism'... that feels
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;very cold.
</em><br />

<br />

<br />
If somebody else were actually doing something progressive with these
<br />
characters, I might agree with you. However, since the games have been put
<br />
on hold and the show has been cancelled, I really don't think the creators
<br />
would care what we do with them now. Does anybody even know who these people
<br />
are? I really don't think it makes any difference, considering that SEGA
<br />
owns the rights to them, anyway. Also, how do you know what the creators
<br />
originally intended? For all we know, SEGA bought the rights to the
<br />
characters from some cartoonist who was using them as logos for his
<br />
on-the-side pornographic video store. As ridiculous as this sounds, the
<br />
question remains, how do we know?  
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I'm not saying that should be *all* that one focuses on, before you get
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; the revolver out and plug me...but you can't just *ignore* it, either.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If the original creators choose to ignore it, it is ignored.  If you want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a more 'realistic' look at how a a sentient male hedgehog and a sentient
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;female squirrel would react to each other, then how about creating your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;own characters to do so?  Leave Sonic and Sally out of it.
</em><br />

<br />
I disagree again. If everything which is considered different, new or
<br />
invalid were ignored, the human race would never had advanced anywhere. Do
<br />
you think that the famous inventors in history just had a brilliant flash
<br />
and went and built something? Of course not. They tried many, many different
<br />
things, often using discarded ideas of others. That's the key to all of
<br />
this. The fan-fic authors are trying new ideas, which no one has done
<br />
before, or ideas which someone MIGHT have thought of before.  Whether
<br />
someone agrees with the content or not is everyone's own personal choice. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven't read the story yet, so I cannot make a judgement on it. I can
<br />
enjoy any story, from Jack and Jill to War and Peace. If a story is
<br />
pornographic, fine. If it's content is intended for &quot;mature&quot; audiences,
<br />
fine. It just better have the story to back it up. This is true whether a
<br />
story is controversial or not. If it's good, I like it. If the plot is full
<br />
of holes and the story is just uninteresting, I don't like it. Sex adds
<br />
points to the plot, it doesn't create the plot. 
<br />

<br />
Based on what I've heard, the story &quot;Tail&quot; involves Tails coming of age,
<br />
including the aspects of sexual maturity. As I said before, I enjoy the
<br />
stories which have a serious tone to them, so I'll probably enjoy this one.
<br />
Come on people, puberty and adolescence are very natural segments of all of
<br />
our lives. There is nothing wrong or dirty about it. I find it amazing that
<br />
discussing this stage of our growth, which has such a profound influence on
<br />
us, is taboo. 
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts...
<br />

<br />
-Matt
