<br />
Dan,
<br />

<br />
I would compare working on SONIC to be almost as complex as working on STAR
<br />
TREK, which I have done for both DC Comics and Malibu. When working on any
<br />
TREK-related series, the primary guideline was anything filmed was considered
<br />
&quot;official&quot; TREK history. It's only now that some novels or certain projects
<br />
contain &quot;official&quot; information considered part of TREK lore. Even so, nothing
<br />
printed in comics is deemed official. In fact, Roddenberry supposedly
<br />
disavowed the animation series he spearheaded back in the early '70's, even
<br />
though it features stories by such TREK luminaries as D.C. Fontana, David
<br />
Gerrold and Walter Koenig. Not to mention the voices of the ORIGINAL CAST!!!
<br />
As far as I'm aware, even though Gene's ashes are scattered out in space,
<br />
Paramount still doesn't acknowledge the animated series.
<br />

<br />
So if you operate on the premise that the source material is the official
<br />
history, it's hit or miss when transferring the characters, stories or series
<br />
to other media. By this thinking, whatever material SEGA puts out is
<br />
official. Anything else put out by other media, such as the comics or TV
<br />
series is official only as long as SEGA deems it so. If there are
<br />
discrepancies, and there are many too numerous to go into here, it's not
<br />
because anyone wants to deliberately confuse anyone. It's due more to a lack
<br />
of any dedicated resources co-ordinating details concerning the world of
<br />
SONIC.
<br />

<br />
Even Mike and I get it wrong ourselves. For instance, in A SENSE OF HISTORY
<br />
Part One, we showed a hedgehog pounding a sign into the ground with his
<br />
family standing nearby. We originally had on the sign &quot;Future Site of
<br />
Knothole Village&quot;, as we thought it would be a neat bit to state that
<br />
Knothole Village stands where the Floating Island once existed. However, when
<br />
we wrote that, Mike Gallagher was only beginning to write the TAILS
<br />
mini-series. After he established the world of Downunda and Knuckles'
<br />
grandfather Athair, it was decided it made more sense since echidnas come
<br />
from Austrailia to have the Floating Island originate from Downunda. Due to a
<br />
rush of deadlines at this time, I wasn't even made aware of this until I saw
<br />
the printed story.
<br />

<br />
The only bible I ever worked with in regards to the SONIC comic series was
<br />
the one for the ABC Saturday morning series and character model sheets from
<br />
SEGA, and that was it. I had to depend on my 8-year-old son Stephen to keep
<br />
me in line regarding SONIC as he is a HUGE fan. (A side note here: I got
<br />
involved with SONIC because he is my son's FAVORITE character.)
<br />

<br />
When Mike and I started working on the series, we were submitting stories
<br />
based on what Mike Gallagher was doing, as he was the primary writer at the
<br />
time. With each passing story, we started getting subversive and began
<br />
emphasizing more of the adventure aspects and less of the bad puns, using
<br />
humor when called for, and not doing a gag at the expense of the story. If
<br />
you go back and reread those early issues, you'll see how we gradually began
<br />
to steer the book in the direction we wanted rather than maintaining the
<br />
status quo. However, we could not have done this had the folks at SEGA not
<br />
been receptive to what we were trying to do.
<br />

<br />
Of all the ideas we submitted, the original story proposal for the PRINCESS
<br />
SALLY mini-series is the one I'm sorry didn't get off the ground, but I think
<br />
we more than made up for it with the KNUCKLES mini-series.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Battle-hardened&quot; describes an attitude, not tactics. If Sonic and Sally and
<br />
company had been fighting for over ten years with Robotnik, they'd have the
<br />
attitude and look reminiscent of soldiers fighting in the trenches during
<br />
World War II. And we'd love to do that, but we can't because of our young
<br />
audience. As it is, in order to get anything with an edge through, we use
<br />
Disney as our guideline, as in: If Disney can do it in their cartoons, why
<br />
can't we in our comics.
<br />

<br />
As for Sonic's history, Mike and I have a rough timeline and what stories
<br />
we'd like to document about that timeline. For instance, if you read SONIC
<br />
#36, we mention Robotnik's mentor Kodos, who is going to feature very
<br />
prominently in the series after issue #50. In #17, we showed Robotnik taking
<br />
over Mobotropolis, and portray Julayla getting Sonic and Sally to safety.
<br />
Although we didn't have the room, Rosie was there as well, making sure that
<br />
Tails was escorted safely out of the war zone. Antoine and Rotor were at the
<br />
front lines, and beat a retreat to fight another day. Tails' parents were
<br />
among those roboticized, and we have yet to decide how or if we'll
<br />
incorporate them into the series. Y'see, we can answer your questions
<br />
regarding continuity, but this is the Archie version APPROVED by SEGA.
<br />

<br />
I apologize for rambling, but I tried to answer your letter the best way I
<br />
could to explain why things are the way they are. This is not meant to
<br />
detract from the fan-fic, which for reasons I'm sure you understand, I don't
<br />
read and can't comment on. If the fans want to fill in the blanks, that's
<br />
what TREK fans have been doing the past 30 years, and there's been no end to
<br />
any of the debate regardless.
<br />
