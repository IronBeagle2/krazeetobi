<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Now about evolution... as most of you know, on Earth, creatures' ability to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;thrive in certain climates and locations led to their evolution. It could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that Mobius' continental drifting was somewhat different, thus causing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;evolutionary cycle to take a different path than Earth's own...?
</em><br />

<br />
Well, I've always found it interesting that so many different species could
<br />
evolve at the same time, yet co-exist peacefully on Mobius. Normally, if
<br />
more than one species occupies the same place in an ecosystem, one of them
<br />
will overcome all others. If I remember my anthropology from freshman year,
<br />
this is known as the Law of Competitive Exclusion. Based on what we know
<br />
about primitive human cultures (Well...they weren't really human yet) this
<br />
has happened several times with evolved species. One species was just
<br />
totally wiped out by another. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Of course, it's also possible that all of the species on Mobius evolved at
<br />
different times. This is most likely what will happen on Earth in the
<br />
future. Right now, humans are the only animals that can be called sentient.
<br />
However, there is one group of living things that has showed some evidence
<br />
of sentience other than us, and those are bees. But I'm straying from the
<br />
topic. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Maybe there were separate cultures at one time on Mobius, but they must have
<br />
been completely isolated from one another in order for each one to remain in
<br />
existence without their inhabitants being conquered/destroyed/forced to
<br />
migrate by another, more powerful, empire. (Unless they were all extremely
<br />
benevolent cultures...kind of unlikely, don't you think?) We could use a few
<br />
Mobian history books on this one. :) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
Might be interesting to learn if there were some Mobian equivalent of the
<br />
Holy Roman Empire, or ancient Greece. Hedgehog emperors and
<br />
philosophers...scary. ;)
