<br />
Part 2.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse walked slowly over to Sally's hut, anxious.  When he got to the 
<br />
door, he took one last look at the village that was Knothole.  He sighed and 
<br />
said to himself, &quot;When I leave this hut, I'll either be a Freedom Fighter ...or 
<br />
I won't ever come back.&quot;  Then, just before turning around and knocking on the 
<br />
door, he breathed deeply and said, &quot;Well, it won't be because I didn't try.  I 
<br />
am *not* going to mess this up!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking one last deep breath, he knocked on the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come in,&quot; said a pleasant voice.  He did.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked up from where she was seated.  &quot;Tolouse.  Sit down.&quot;  He did.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a few minutes there was silence, and Tolouse's heart pounded against 
<br />
his chest.  But he made himself keep still, and he locked his gaze with 
<br />
Sally's.  I am *not* going to mess this up!  Finally, Sally spoke.
<br />

<br />
[[Author's note:  Tolouse has been sworn to secrecy about the conversation that 
<br />
took place between him and Sally.  Therefore, this story has been edited for 
<br />
the public.  Sorry :-).]]
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at Tolouse once again, and then smiled, very faintly so 
<br />
Tolouse would not notice.  Then, she got up and looked out the window.  
<br />
&quot;Tolouse, do me a favor.  You must promise not to tell anyone about these 
<br />
questions or your answers.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse nodded.  &quot;I promise.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally turned back around.  &quot;Can you, on oath as a Freedom Fighter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse's eyes shot up at her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally chuckled.  &quot;Well, if you're going to be a Freedom Fighter, prove to 
<br />
me that I can trust you like one!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse got up and stood tall.  &quot;Princess Sally, I promise you that I will 
<br />
not tell anyone about your questions.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled, and placed her hand on his shoulder.  &quot;Welcome aboard, 
<br />
Tolouse.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse's mind flew in one thousand different directions at once, and his 
<br />
body threatened to do the same, but he held his composure and said, &quot;Thank you, 
<br />
Princess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally chuckled again.  &quot;Please, like I told Sonic, just refer to me as 
<br />
'Sally'.  You see, the reason I want you to not say anything is so I can use 
<br />
these questions again, with other potential Freedom Fighters.  Understand what 
<br />
I mean?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse nodded.  &quot;I do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  Now, do me another favor will you?  Help me play a little joke on 
<br />
Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse blinked.  &quot;A joke?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally giggled.  &quot;Well, even I can have a little fun every once in a while, 
<br />
especially where that hedgehog is concerned.&quot;  Sally grinned.  &quot;Will you help 
<br />
me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure, I guess.  What do I do?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Stay here while I walk out and tell him that I've decided you should not 
<br />
be a Freedom Fighter.  Then, I'll let him come in, and you play your part.  
<br />
Then we'll spring it on him together!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse thought about it.  &quot;He...won't mind...?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally giggled again.  &quot;That hedgehog is always playing jokes on people.  
<br />
He'll just be getting a dose of his own medicine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, okay.  I can do that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled.  &quot;Thank you.  Just wait here, okay?&quot; and she was out the 
<br />
door.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right as the door closed, a loud &quot;YES!!&quot; could have been heard within the 
<br />
walls of Sally's hut.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You did, huh?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am sorry, Sonic, but I think he took it well.  I told him he was 
<br />
welcome to stay at Knothole, but I just don't think he's ready to be a Freedom 
<br />
Fighter yet.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic shook his head, but said nothing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally spoke up.  &quot;Why don't you go and talk to him?  I'm sure he could use 
<br />
the company.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess,&quot; Sonic said, and walked towards Sally's hut.  He didn't hear 
<br />
Sally's faint giggle coming from behind him.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked up as Sonic came in, and did his best to hide his 
<br />
excitement.  He got up and pretended to look wistfully out the window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, bud.  Sally, uh, told me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I guess,&quot; Tolouse said, making sure to put a note of sadness in his 
<br />
voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, cheer up, Tolly!  You can stay here, and someday, maybe...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I can't hold on any longer!  But right as Tolouse turned around, Sally 
<br />
entered the hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gotcha, Sonic,&quot; she said, and giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Huh?&quot;  Sonic turned to Tolouse, confused.  Tolouse burst out laughing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned back to Sally, more confused.  &quot;But I thought...hey!  You 
<br />
tricked me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That I did, Sonic,&quot; Sally said.  She looked at Tolouse.  &quot;Sonic, meet our 
<br />
newest Freedom Fighter.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked at Tolouse, who was beaming with pride.  &quot;All right!!&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that day, Sonic and Tolouse sat under a tree, talking about 
<br />
themselves and listening to the wind rustling the leaves.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked over at Tolouse and smiled.  &quot;You're in, bud.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse sighed.  &quot;I'm in.&quot;  Tears of joy once again began to well in his 
<br />
eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic couldn't take such a display of emotion.  &quot;Hey, ease up!&quot;  he said.  
<br />
Finally, he got up and stretched.  &quot;Come on.  Sally and I are gonna talk to you 
<br />
tomorrow about what we do.  But first thing's first.  We gotta get you some 
<br />
place to live, and I want ya to meet a few people!&quot;  He thought for a moment, 
<br />
then started back towards the village.  &quot;Follow me, I know just where you can 
<br />
stay.  Si's old place!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stopped right when the name 'Si' left his lips, and he remembered 
<br />
what Sally had warned about failed missions.  He sighed as his mind went back 
<br />
to a couple of months ago, when such a mission had resulted in the loss of a 
<br />
friend.  &quot;Tolouse?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He studied Tolouse once again.  &quot;This really what you want?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse felt more certain with each passing second.  &quot;Yes, Sonic.  I've 
<br />
waited my whole life for this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saw the look of certainty in Tolouse's eyes, and his spirits lifted 
<br />
again.  &quot;Well that's good, bud, 'cuz you're gonna be in for quite an adventure!  
<br />
Let's go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
