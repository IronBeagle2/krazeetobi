<br />

<br />
Temporal Notice:  The events detailed here take place in early
<br />
fall (October 12th by Terran equivalent), year 3236.
<br />

<br />
Present day...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The month of September had been a tedious and very difficult
<br />
one for all the Freedom Fighter groups.  Once every thirteen
<br />
years, for climatological reasons unknown, the winter season had
<br />
a rather malicious habit of arriving too promptly for those that
<br />
were unprepared for it.  The end result:  Knothole had been
<br />
almost been at the level of desperation in supply distribution;
<br />
since after the war ended with Robotnik about six months before,
<br />
it had become the major control center of the Freedom Fighter
<br />
groups by default.  Since the locus of many of the tunnels was
<br />
Knothole, the commanders had their hands full attempting to
<br />
organize so many people into such a small space AND direct them
<br />
to the appropriate centers for cargo shipping.  This was a
<br />
tedious process, since they only had a few Hover Units, and a
<br />
Hover Unit can only contain a limited amount of cargo.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knothole was crowded in many ways more than one.  Many of the
<br />
members from the other groups moved there not very long ago,
<br />
either to escape from unfavorable climate, be closer to their
<br />
intimates, or for various other reasons.  Unfortunately, this
<br />
began to create an overpopulation bottleneck in Knothole,
<br />
considering that the habitable zone was previously designed to
<br />
maintain the original residents plus 25% surplus.  Knothole was
<br />
now at 35%, making the situation disturbing, and nearly
<br />
intolerable for Sally, since the majority of the burden was hers
<br />
to cope with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'As much as I like them,' Sally said to herself in her
<br />
thoughts, 'one of these days those people are going to have to
<br />
find a new home.  This overcrowding is really putting a cramp in
<br />
my administrative duties, for both Knothole and everywhere else.
<br />
&nbsp;I never thought it would be so difficult to work with all these
<br />
extra people!  Who knows, maybe some of this weather will drive
<br />
them off...I hope.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A rapping sound emanating from her door snapped her mind to
<br />
reality and from the universe of her thoughts.  She walked to
<br />
the location of the sound and opened the door.  Of course, she
<br />
should have remembered.  Only David and Tails would ever signal
<br />
that low on a door relative to everyone else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, Tails,&quot; Sally said as benignly as possible, trying to
<br />
keep the stress from the past month plus now out of her mind.
<br />
&quot;Please, come in.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little red fox hesitated for a second, for he couldn't miss
<br />
the general impression that she was somewhat perturbed.  He then
<br />
entered, after analyzing the situation in his mind.  She wasn't
<br />
angry at him;  just irritated, probably for the reason that
<br />
nearly everyone else was.  That knowledge still didn't resolve
<br />
any of his reluctance, however.  He scanned over what he could
<br />
see in her hut.  The place was a disaster area, which was very
<br />
uncharacteristic of her;  except for when she was under high
<br />
levels of tension that she was incapable of dispensing with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gee,&quot; Tails began, trying to resonate his voice in a joking
<br />
manner and failing at the attempt, &quot;are you sure it's safe for
<br />
me to come in here?&quot;  He chuckled a bit, nervously, belatedly
<br />
uncertain that his faux jovial attitude would present him with
<br />
the desired result.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His suspicions were correct, and for once wished that they were
<br />
not.  All Sally did was fix him with a cold, hard stare for
<br />
about ten seconds.  As much as he desired to erase that
<br />
expression from his mind's eye, he couldn't.  She captured his
<br />
gaze, and wouldn't release it under his accord.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if realizing what had transpired, she immediately averted
<br />
her harsh regard.  &quot;Oh, I'm sorry, honey,&quot; she finally
<br />
responded, nearly in tears.  &quot;I didn't mean to look at you like
<br />
that.  It's just that...I've been under a lot of stress lately,
<br />
and...&quot;  She disengaged her monologue, not knowing how to
<br />
continue her apology to the little cub.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails went over to her in a gesture of reassurance, and
<br />
embraced her.  &quot;It's OK, Aunt Sally,&quot; he stated with sympathy.
<br />
&quot;Nearly everyone's been this way for the past few weeks, except
<br />
David.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was her turn for a faltering guffaw.  &quot;David?&quot; she asked,
<br />
observantly and somewhat disconcerted by the reference.  &quot;The
<br />
only time I've seen David irritated about something is that time
<br />
he had a system-wide failure before he completely rebuilt
<br />
himself.  I don't know if ANYTHING else perturbs your brother or
<br />
not.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, that been the only thing so far,&quot; he ventured, &quot;he
<br />
hasn't gotten mad about anything el-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another interruption from the direction of the door.  From the
<br />
general location of the sound, it had to be David, but appended
<br />
to the knock was a high level of insistence.  She opened the
<br />
door and saw David standing before the doorway, with a look of
<br />
extreme distress on his face.  Sonic stood beside him, the
<br />
normally cavorting hedgehog looking equally distraught.  Aspects
<br />
that were uncharacteristic of the David and Sonic she knew.
<br />
Something was horribly wrong.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hiya, Sal.  Hi, big guy,&quot; the hedgehog greeted nervously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, Aunt Sally,&quot; David dictated politely, despite the
<br />
despairing mask he wore.  Seeing his vulpine familiar next to
<br />
her, he continued, &quot;And to you, Tails.  May we be allowed to
<br />
enter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why...yes, certainly.  Come right in, both of you,&quot; she
<br />
answered, careful to keep the expectancy out of her voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She knew now wasn't the time to make demands, and that her
<br />
friends would eventually notify her of the unspoken calamity.
<br />
David was a fox of truth, and the truth would reveal itself when
<br />
he regained his composure so that he could speak as a composed
<br />
observer of events.  Sonic was usually more at ease with
<br />
reporting potential or known problems, but the lack of response
<br />
told her that he either preferred to allow David to explain the
<br />
situation since David would present the information in its
<br />
entirety, or that it was so severe he couldn't face it himself.
<br />
Sally and Tails sat on her bed, watching the fox and hedgehog
<br />
pair stand and reflect on Knothole's status.  A few minutes
<br />
later, the fox altered his look of despair to one of
<br />
seriousness, and that was her cue that he was prepared to
<br />
disclose the information he was so reluctant to make known to
<br />
her before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What happened out there, David?&quot; she demanded kindly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have taken the liberty as a Knothole Freedom Fighter
<br />
Commander to assist a fellow officer in assessing the supply
<br />
manifests,&quot; he initiated, with the extreme dread literally
<br />
dripping from his voice, &quot;and Sonic and I have concluded that we
<br />
do not have a sufficient supply of reserve food stock to survive
<br />
the winter.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a very devastating report for Sally, and she knew that
<br />
if this knowledge was made public, it would inevitably promote a
<br />
state of alarm for the rest of Knothole.  Besides the permanent
<br />
residents of Knothole, there were the other members of the
<br />
Mobius Freedom Fighter groups to consider as well.  And the
<br />
influx of new residents gradually increased every month at the
<br />
least, sometimes even by the week.  Hearing David report the
<br />
potential calamity only served to portray the situation in its
<br />
entirety, with the proof as tenacious as granite.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who else besides us knows about this?&quot; she inquired, as if
<br />
expecting a riot to erupt anytime now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We are the only four in Knothole who have the knowledge of the
<br />
food supply statistics,&quot; David reassured, but cast a vacant
<br />
stare directed toward the floor as he continued.  &quot;However,
<br />
maintaining the subject under covert guard will merely delay the
<br />
inevitable;  not prevent it.  The others will more than likely
<br />
learn of the truth, if not now, then in the near future.  It
<br />
will become necessary for us to inform the rest of Knothole
<br />
about the reserve food shortage anyway, so in either case we
<br />
would have a responsibility to prevent panic and rioting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The compuorganic vulpine missed nothing.  'It's days like these
<br />
when I wish David WASN'T so perfect,' she thought.  'Maybe if
<br />
just a few little white lies were programmed in there somewhere,
<br />
letting us know that things were all right, even though they
<br />
might not be.'  Yet, deep down inside, she knew that for him to
<br />
do so would be a sin against his programming and moral beliefs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about shipping the surplus from other bases?  How long
<br />
would that take?&quot;  Sally asked, in order to get a better idea of
<br />
how severe the state could be.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic answered for her.  &quot;No way, Sal.  It could take days, and
<br />
we don't have that time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails finally spoke after he saw that the preliminaries of the
<br />
situation had been established from the verbal exchange.  &quot;What
<br />
can we do about this, David?&quot; he asked his relative, the one
<br />
ultimately in command of the circumstances.  &quot;How hard could it
<br />
be to repair the replicator?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Addressing both Tails and Sally this time, David responded,
<br />
&quot;The reports I've received from Rotor and Bookshire are not in
<br />
our favor.  The supply of replacement hardware has nearly been
<br />
depleted, and even if the replicator did become active again, we
<br />
no longer have the base organic stock necessary for food
<br />
replication.  We do have the required chemicals to create the
<br />
organic stock, but we also do not have the hardware to overhaul
<br />
the replicator.&quot;  A long pause as he compiled and resolved the
<br />
thoughts in his mind.  &quot;No, the only alternatives I can consider
<br />
at this point and time would be to find suitable areas on Mobius
<br />
for our surplus population to inhabit, locate a food resource
<br />
area that we might conceivably be able to transport raw stock
<br />
from, or locate the required hardware for the replicator.
<br />
Unless either of you have other suggestions, I propose sending a
<br />
survey party to analyze the potential success of executing the
<br />
plans I specified.&quot;  He waited patiently for an answer from
<br />
Sally and Tails, for he and Sonic had already examined the
<br />
matter at length before approaching Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young fox and the more senior ground squirrel regarded each
<br />
other with anxiety, as if to say, &quot;I don't.  Do you?&quot;  No
<br />
resolution of the implied question for other theories of dealing
<br />
with the problem at hand was forthcoming.  They then returned
<br />
their attention to the black and gray fox, then to the blue
<br />
hedgehog.  Neither had to receive verbal interpretation of the
<br />
silence indicated by Sally and Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After inspecting his internal chronometer for an attosecond,
<br />
David decreed, &quot;Very well, then.  The investigatory detail will
<br />
depart at 1000 hours tomorrow, seeing as-&quot;, he indicated the
<br />
illumination level outside, which was gradually grading toward
<br />
darkness as the sun extended its contact with the horizon, &quot;-it
<br />
would be inadvisable to do so now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who do you plan to take?&quot; Sally inquired.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As of now, the proposed party consists of me and Dulcy.  If
<br />
anyone else wishes to-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interruption from Sonic.  Not verbal, but his reaction was
<br />
more than explanatory enough to convey his opinions about having
<br />
Dulcy in a mission when there was more than likely to be flying
<br />
involved.  He seized Tails by the sides of his chest, and darted
<br />
with him out of Sally's hut, in an effort to spare himself and
<br />
his comrade from another of Dulcy's flights.  Sally could only
<br />
stare at the unannounced and rushed departure, whereas David
<br />
placed his right paw on his forehead, sighing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I had predicted the probability of this occurrence,&quot; he said
<br />
with reservation to a point off in space, &quot;and it looks as if I
<br />
was correct.  Next time, I will pay more attention to my
<br />
predictive subroutine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After finally regaining some of her composure, Sally voiced her
<br />
shock at the situation.  &quot;I never saw Sonic take off like that
<br />
before, especially not about Dulcy.  Is something wrong, David?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He responded, &quot;Nothing beyond the usual faulty landings that
<br />
she executes.  Apparently, Sonic isn't the only one that shares
<br />
the fear of being part of a mission with Dulcy.  This belief has
<br />
already spread through the rest of Knothole,&quot; he finished, with
<br />
obvious sympathy for the dragon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How bad is it now?&quot; she continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I believe at this phase every one has lost faith in Dulcy to
<br />
properly correct her landings.  Especially from the incident
<br />
where she impacted with ten huts after falling victim to a wind
<br />
shear pattern on her final approach.  She and ten others were
<br />
injured in that crash.&quot;  His computers and organic memory cells
<br />
accessed the appropriate memory in question, and images in his
<br />
mind's eye formed of him valiantly defending Dulcy, noticing how
<br />
no one else would subscribe to his explanations.  Not even Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were the unspoken incidents of similar, countless
<br />
failures in nearly all the touchdowns that Dulcy made.
<br />
Invariably, she would land in the same fashion:  lose her
<br />
balance, then fall forward, scraping her chin on the ground, not
<br />
to mention jarring her passengers.  The rest of the Freedom
<br />
Fighters eventually lost faith in Dulcy's abilities, and
<br />
publicly made that point clear.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Sally stated after thinking over the dragon's public
<br />
appearance, &quot;the only thing that we can do now is try to build
<br />
up her confidence, and that of everyone else's in her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I concur,&quot; the fox agreed.  &quot;I just so happen to have an
<br />
experimental technique to bolster her confidence and perfect her
<br />
landing procedure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His female comrade looked at him, as if surprised that a
<br />
solitary vulpine could perform such a feat.  She had her doubts
<br />
about David's success in providing the dragon with the
<br />
initiative for flying and going out in public again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Noticing the nature behind the dissension, he said, &quot;It will be
<br />
successful, Sally.  Trust me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She chuckled, remembering who was famous for submitting that
<br />
particular phrase.  &quot;OK, David,&quot; she finally said, smiling.  &quot;I
<br />
believe you.&quot;  If Sonic had done so, she wouldn't have believed
<br />
it.  Knowing David's record for truthfulness restricted her
<br />
standard reflexive &quot;Oh, I hate it when you say that&quot; retort.  If
<br />
her young colleague believed that the undertaking was to result
<br />
in a favorable outcome, then it would be so.  She playfully
<br />
tugged on his cheek, knowing that he would teasingly despise her
<br />
for it.  She then kissed his olfactory sensor, with the
<br />
knowledge that the reaction would be humorous as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her suspicions were no further from the truth.  The juvenile
<br />
fox directed his gaze toward the floor, rubbing the protesting
<br />
sensitivity out of his nose.  After the uprising had dissipated,
<br />
he lowered his arms to his sides while compressing his paws into
<br />
dangerous-looking fists, brought his face into full view of
<br />
Sally's field of vision, and set his expression into one of mock
<br />
contempt.  She parroted the threat to him.  Laughter exploded
<br />
from the hut as they lovingly embraced each other.  This was the
<br />
most rewarding occurrence for Sally in the past three weeks, and
<br />
she intended to savor every second of it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After David regained control of his emotional state, but still
<br />
visibly feeling the residual effects of the last fifteen
<br />
seconds, he spoke.  &quot;Now that we both understand each other, I
<br />
believe I have business to attend to.  Good night, Aunt Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night, David.  Good luck with Dulcy,&quot; she replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Remember: this fox ALWAYS keeps his word.&quot;  And with that last
<br />
statement, he exited from her hut, walking toward Dulcy's.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A deafening guffaw from the background immediately after David
<br />
was out of the field of view.  Sally snickered for a few
<br />
seconds, then began the task of organizing her disorganized
<br />
domicile.  The stress, at least for today, had been alleviated.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having dispensed with the effects of what transpired in the
<br />
past minute, David recomposed himself into his more reserved
<br />
manner.  He tapped on Dulcy's door, then patiently bided his
<br />
time for her response.  He received his invitation five seconds
<br />
later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go away,&quot; the dragon demanded, the irritated and morbid sound
<br />
of her voice indicating her interest for solitude.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy,&quot; the vulpine called genially, &quot;it's me, David.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DAVID?!&quot; she exclaimed, apparently surprised that out of all
<br />
the others in Knothole, her closest advocate would arrive to
<br />
visit her.  &quot;Oh, nonononononono,&quot; she mumbled in belated regret
<br />
for her previous remark.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fox's sensitive hearing heard the dragon's racing steps,
<br />
the audio frequency increasing with the Doppler shift as she
<br />
approached the door.  The door burst open, expelling a small
<br />
amount of air from inside.  She immediately, but gently, picked
<br />
him up, then dashed back into her hut with him cradled in her
<br />
arms as if he were an infant.  The door created a clattering
<br />
report as it regained contact with the doorway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking down on David with astonishment and embarrassment, she
<br />
whispered so that only she and he could hear, &quot;It's nice to see
<br />
you again, David.  But you really shouldn't be here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why is that?&quot; he queried, in a slightly more audible voice.
<br />
His face contorted from one of amazement at Dulcy's response to
<br />
one of a cynical nature.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm bad luck.  Everyone knows that,&quot; Dulcy explained in a
<br />
beleaguered tone.  &quot;No one wants to go out with me anymore.
<br />
I've lost my interest in flying, since there's nobody to be with
<br />
me.&quot;  She lightly placed her ally on the floor and turned her
<br />
head away from him, as if to spare him from a curse.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy,&quot; David commenced, now in mock disgrace, &quot;you insult me.
<br />
&nbsp;I don't subscribe to the 'popular' theories concerning you;
<br />
therefore I have no place in the universally-inclusive
<br />
'everyone'.&quot;  He paused to permit the implied significance of
<br />
the delivery take effect.  The response was unfavorable, for
<br />
Dulcy didn't redirect her head toward him.  He was prepared to
<br />
entrust his life to her, and she didn't take heed of the
<br />
unspoken message.  In favor of something more candid, he
<br />
ordered, &quot;Dulcy, I want to see you at the bridge at 1000 hours
<br />
tomorrow.  We have an exploratory mission to perform for food
<br />
supplies, hardware for the replicator, and for possible
<br />
habitation sites for our excess population here at Knothole.  I
<br />
require you to be prepared for it before that time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the dragon's turn to be taken aback by the unexpected.
<br />
&quot;You REALLY mean it, David?&quot; her face deformed with the extreme
<br />
amazement.  &quot;YOU want to go on a mission with ME?  I didn't know
<br />
you cared about me so much,&quot; she warbled, whimpering with
<br />
gaiety.  She very gently picked her comrade up again, and hugged
<br />
him, her hot tears plummeting to the fox's head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course I care about you,&quot; he assured, returning the embrace
<br />
to Dulcy.  &quot;I am a Freedom Fighter Commander, and your comrade.
<br />
I would not have the status I maintain now if I didn't consider
<br />
the personal side, the needs of my subordinates.  I'm still the
<br />
David you always knew, Dulcy.  Even if I don't always have the
<br />
opportunity now to be with everyone here in Knothole, I love
<br />
them all as my friends, and even as family.  And I am proud to
<br />
have you as a sister in our extended family.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, David,&quot; she said with a kind of gratified sadness,
<br />
clutching him tighter against her torso.  &quot;This is so touching.
<br />
You're growing up, just like your brother.&quot;  She then presented
<br />
him with a full-bodied dragon kiss that reeked of hydrogen
<br />
sulfide.  She then returned him to his original position on the
<br />
floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I meant what I told you, Dulcy, and I want you to remember
<br />
that I'm available to assist you with every means I am capable
<br />
of.  Now if you will excuse me,&quot; he said as his dermal sensors
<br />
indicated a slightly higher degree of water on his skin, plus
<br />
the imposed and unpleasant smell, &quot;I believe I need to continue
<br />
my shower.  See you tomorrow at 1000 hours.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be there,&quot; the now exuberant dragon replied.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As David walked away from the double-huts of his two closest
<br />
female companions, he pretended not to notice that Sally and
<br />
Dulcy were covertly watching him.  He then heard a joyous
<br />
&quot;Yeeha!&quot; as continued his cadence.  The unanticipated comeback
<br />
from the pair made him halt, and body visibly cringed in
<br />
exaggerated astoundment.  Tittering from the background
<br />
indicated their appreciation.  The soaked fox executed an
<br />
about-face, as if to defend himself from a stealthy adversary.
<br />
His visible light grids detected nothing, but his IR sensors
<br />
located Sally and Dulcy, &quot;hiding&quot; from him under their windows.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vulpine shook his head with a small degree of awe.  'Now I
<br />
have the knowledge that part of my duty as a Freedom Fighter
<br />
Commander is complete,' he thought.  'When I have reinsured that
<br />
level of happiness in two of my friends despite the general
<br />
trend of the day, I know that I have been able to commit myself
<br />
to their necessities, and succeed.'  He engaged his
<br />
rotor/nacelles, and flew off toward his and his brother's home.
