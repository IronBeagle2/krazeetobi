<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, try it again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A silent tension filled the air inside Sally's hut.  Sandy
<br />
was seated at a table, her right arm the subject of intense work.
<br />
Rotor had studied it for some time and was trying to get it
<br />
functioning again.  After half a dozen adjustment it continued to
<br />
lay there, unresponsive to Sandy's attempts at movement.  Now
<br />
Rotor had tried totally replacing what appeared to be a shorted-
<br />
out motivator located on the forearm.  Sally and Sonic held their
<br />
breath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a second, nothing happened.  Then, in a single smooth
<br />
motion, Sandy's fingers curled up into a fist and just as
<br />
effortlessly uncurled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes!&quot; Sonic yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great job, Rotor!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks, Sally, but looks like the upper arm motivator is
<br />
going to need replacement as well.  I think I have one in the
<br />
storeroom.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not the storeroom!&quot; Sonic wailed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Sally said, &quot;go help Rotor look for one.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But Sal, if he opens that door I'll be up to my hips in
<br />
chips!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic,&quot; Sally said deliberately, &quot;go help Rotor!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, OK,&quot; Sonic said as he followed Rotor out the door. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally closed it behind them, then turned to face her sister.
<br />
&quot;What did you think you were doing?&quot;  she demanded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know what I was doing, and you can't stop me from
<br />
trying again!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I can try!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you honestly say that you wouldn't do the same thing if
<br />
you were in my position?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you....&quot;  Sally stopped.  For a second her attention
<br />
was no longer on Sandy.  It was as if she had seen something
<br />
before her eyes, something that had disappeared as soon as it had
<br />
come into her field of vision.  She turned back to Sandy.  Her
<br />
voice was subdued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I...I just remembered of Mother's last words to you.  How
<br />
she called you by name and said: 'You are free now to choose your
<br />
own path.'  Then she held your hand and said goodbye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sandy, it was wrong of me to try to stop you.  I'm sorry. 
<br />
I won't try it again if you're bent on vengeance against
<br />
Robotnik.  But you have to understand that our fight against him
<br />
has never been about revenge.  It's been about restoring our
<br />
families, our world.  It...I'm sorry, Sandy; I hope you
<br />
understand.&quot;  With that, she turned away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally turned.  For the first time, Sally saw tears in
<br />
Sandy's eyes; Sandy had not even cried at the death of their
<br />
mother.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I just remembered Mother's last words to you,&quot; Sandy said. 
<br />
&quot;How she called you by name and said: 'You have understanding,
<br />
and you have friends.'  Then she held your hand and said goodbye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally, I...I'm sorry I didn't recognize that understanding
<br />
sooner.  I owe you a debt I can never repay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;When the possibility arose that you might still be alive, I
<br />
didn't want to believe it.  I tried to talk Mother out of
<br />
travelling to Knothole to see you.  Even as we made our way here
<br />
I secretly hoped it all would have been a lie.  But if we'd never
<br />
looked for you, then Mother would have gone to her grave
<br />
somewhere in the deserts of Nomad country with a question in her
<br />
heart, and the sands would have buried her stone of memory inside
<br />
of two days.  Instead, she died with her heart at peace,
<br />
surrounded by the love and loyalty that a Queen deserves.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled at the same time tears rolled down her cheeks.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You have done more for her than anyone could have hoped
<br />
for, Sally.  I am your servant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; she said gently, &quot;you're my sister.&quot;  Sally put her
<br />
arms around Sandy, who did the best she could with the one arm
<br />
that functioned.  A minute later, Sonic and Rotor re-entered the
<br />
hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got it, Sally!  It's just take a minute to install.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah,&quot; Sonic griped, &quot;and I'll be picking computer chips
<br />
out of my quills for a week!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So,&quot; Rotor went on, making idle conversation, &quot;you gonna
<br />
stay around here, Sandy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally held her breath.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, Rotor.  I've been thinking about it and I've made up my
<br />
mind.  I'll be travelling to the East.  I was thinking of hooking
<br />
up with Dirk and the Eastern freedom fighters.  I think I can
<br />
teach them something about fighting SWATbots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally breathed a sigh of relief.  &quot;That's wonderful, isn't
<br />
it, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, but....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why'd she have to tell Robuttnik about his arm?  Why should
<br />
we do him any favors?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Who knows, Sonic?  Maybe he'll return the favor some day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't get it, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So what else is new?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, Sonic, if Robotnik knows that he's being poisoned by
<br />
his own robotic arm, sooner or later he'll reach the same
<br />
conclusion that Uncle Chuck did: that the only effective
<br />
treatment involves deroboticizing it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So maybe he'll begin working on a deroboticizer of his own,
<br />
and when he's got it perfected....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then we use it against him by undoing all the people he's
<br />
roboticized!  Hey, I guess that's way past cool after all!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What can I say?  Being way past cool runs in the family.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you gonna be all right, Sandy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy and Bunnie stood at the eastern edge of the Great
<br />
Forest.  It was sundown, and the sky to the east was darkening to
<br />
a smooth indigo while streaks of fire still lit the western sky. 
<br />
Sandy had taken leave of Knothole, but Bunnie had insisted on
<br />
escorting Sandy to the edge of the woods.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be fine, Bunnie.  I learned how to navigate using the
<br />
stars from the Nomads.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's nice,&quot; Bunnie said as she leaned against a tree with
<br />
her arms crossed before her, &quot;but that's not what Ah meant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know,&quot; Sandy said quietly as she looked at her
<br />
roboticized right arm, fully functional once more.  &quot;Don't worry
<br />
about me, Bunnie; I won't try anything stupid against Robotnik...
<br />
or myself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah'm glad to hear it,&quot; Bunnie said as she took Sandy's
<br />
hands in her own.  After several seconds she hadn't let go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is there any chance of your coming East some time?&quot; Sandy
<br />
asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No; mostly Ah'll be right here in Knothole.&quot;  Several more
<br />
seconds passed, and still Bunnie hadn't let go.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie...there's something...something I've wanted to...but
<br />
I don't....&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then Ah will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie then embraced Sandy and kissed her.  She kissed her
<br />
hard, on the mouth.  Sandy was caught off-guard, but only for a
<br />
second.  She then returned both the kiss and the embrace.  They
<br />
seemed to go on forever.  When their lips parted with a quiet,
<br />
moist sound, three stars were already visible in the sky
<br />
overhead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You take care of yourself now, Sandy, y'hear?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And for the first time, Bunnie saw Sandy smile--a smile that
<br />
a second later was hidden behind a Nomad's veil.  Sandy took her
<br />
bearings from the sky and started out silently toward the
<br />
darkening East.  Bunnie sighed, turned and began walking through
<br />
the Great Forest to the West, back toward Knothole.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE END
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
