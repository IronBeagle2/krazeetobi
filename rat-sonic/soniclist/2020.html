<br />
Lately, there have been too many inappropriate posts to the Sonic list.
<br />

<br />
Please read this message carefully.  You will be responisble for knowing 
<br />
and following its content.
<br />

<br />
The Sonic PC Game ================= I have tried to be a little more
<br />
lenient on these posts as it is a fan project and not a Sega product
<br />
(Sega's games are already represented in 2 Usenet groups.) These posts
<br />
have begun to dominate the list and to overstep the list's purpose.  As
<br />
stated in the Sonic list's new member introductory text, the list is for
<br />
discussion of the Sonic characters, cartoons, comics, and fan stories. 
<br />
Many of these posts can scarcely (if at all) qualify as discussion of
<br />
Sonic characters, and are not at all discussions of the cartoons and
<br />
comics. 
<br />

<br />
There appears to be enough interest in this project that a seperate list 
<br />
should be considered.  I, personally, support this idea.  A seperate list 
<br />
will help the main list return to its stated purpose as well as free 
<br />
non-interested subscribers from having to receive these posts.  The only 
<br />
&quot;inconvenience&quot; to users I see is having to remember 2 posting addresses 
<br />
rather than 1.
<br />

<br />
The leader(s) of this project might want to ask Ratman (nicely!) if he is 
<br />
willing to set up a second list, or seek a LISTSERV site that will host 
<br />
the list without a fee.  Pobox.com will set up a mailing list for 
<br />
interested persons for a fee, as will many local Internet Serivces 
<br />
Providers.  As a last resort, it is possible, albeit inconvenient, to run 
<br />
a mailing list from a personal e-mail account.
<br />

<br />
Whether or not there is a second list, I am willing to go along with:
<br />
&nbsp;a) Occasional posts to this list that recruit new persons to the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;development team and/or summarize the current state of progress
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in development of the game.  Also, the final announcement of
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;completion as well.
<br />
&nbsp;b) Adding referrals to the team leader(s) to the new subscriber
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;introductory text for this list.
<br />
&nbsp;c) Adding referrals to the team leader(s) to this list's Web
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;page (which really needs to be updated anyway).
<br />

<br />
Until and if a second list is formed, please begin taking these 
<br />
inappropriate posts to private e-mail.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sonic's Paper Game
<br />
==================
<br />
Many of the issues concerning the PC game above apply to this game as 
<br />
well.   I have no problem with the announcement that this game was being 
<br />
offered to interested persons.  Posts discussing the game play overstep 
<br />
this list's purpose.  The &quot;I want a copy&quot; posts should definitely have 
<br />
been sent directly to the person making the announcement and not to the 
<br />
entire mailing list.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Respect For Other Users
<br />
=======================
<br />
Contributions are what keep this list alive, but are not required of 
<br />
anyone.  Who really wants to read posts that say &quot;I have nothing to say 
<br />
but I have to say something, so here's my message.&quot;?  You have the right 
<br />
to be active or lurking according to your own interest and personal time 
<br />
availability.  Do not hurl insults at someone or a group of persons 
<br />
because they aren't active enough to satisfy you -- or for any other 
<br />
reason, for that matter.  If you have a problem with a subscriber on the 
<br />
Sonic list, send e-mail to that person and/or sonic_at_rat.org (with a copy 
<br />
of the offending post).
<br />

<br />
What next?
<br />
==========
<br />
Advisements and administrative warnings have already gone out to some 
<br />
persons.  I hope this message will eliminate the need for me to send any 
<br />
more such messages.  Anyone who now posts or continues to post 
<br />
inappropriate messages is subject to being deleted from the subscriber 
<br />
database.
<br />

<br />
Be aware that the Sonic list could also become a moderated list.  I would 
<br />
not want to see this happen because it would cause posts to be delayed up 
<br />
to 48 hours (not to mention the effort it would take me to forward 
<br />
*every* message to the list).  Please think before you post, and don't 
<br />
make this become a moderated list.
<br />

<br />
Adulations or flames regarding this message or any other administrative 
<br />
issue should be sent to sonic_at_rat.org and not posted to the list.
<br />

<br />
Thank you for your attention and expected co-operation.
