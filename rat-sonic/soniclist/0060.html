Hiyas.  Wow.  We're off to a big start here aren't we (re: This list)
<br />
Anyway.  Last night I went through all the Sonic comic books I had and
<br />
compiled the beginnings of what could be a FAQ list.
<br />

<br />
Before I get to it I wanted to make a few comments on what I've seen so far.
<br />

<br />
Alessandro Sanasi:  Don't worry about your English, its fine...  also, you
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;mentioned a comic book by Fleetway Publications.  I never heard of it 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;before.  I also don't have anything to view ANSI graphics.. Hrm
<br />

<br />
Jeffery Pegnato:  Its true she doesn't have your typical squirrel tail
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;(some ground squirrels have short tails) but I really can't envision her
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;as a fox (well.. as a vulpine species).  I personally think she was 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;adopted or daughter by marriage.
<br />

<br />
List manager guy Majordomo: The address to mail to the list is kinda hidden
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the welcome file.  Also, unless people provide .sigs with their e-mail
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;address the mail headers I get don't have the return address.  ELM will
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;attempt to send the mail to the whole list if I simply hit 'r' to reply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to fix this from your end?  I've seen it done before but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;know next to zero about setting up a mailing list?
<br />

<br />
Sally's Vest &amp; Species posts: I like the vest.  Gives her a bit more class.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;As for her species and the age of sonic.. I have some info about that in 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;my FAQ list.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Action Figures:  I haven't found any.  I have found two types of 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;plush sonics though (one from Sears and another I find in a videogame
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;store.. Plush Tails too however I don't think his tails are big enough :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark Young.. that videogame store seems to still keep the plush sonics
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;in stock [Its a chain called 'Software Etc.']
<br />

<br />
Tails's 2nd Tail:  The most plausable idea I've come up with is he's a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;post-nuclear (or post-robotnik-pollution) mutant although SonicGrams in
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;the comic book has a few others [see the FAQ list].
<br />

<br />
Mark Young:
<br />
Other comments... I've seen both the Weekday and ABC weekend series (although
<br />
Madison only gets the weekend series) and I prefer the weekend series by
<br />
far.  Probably because it takes everything way too seriously alot. :)
<br />

<br />
Yo Ratman!  You're absolutely right.  Rotor looks more like an ugly plush 
<br />
toy than a walrus.  Bring back the old style Rotor!  Antione is really 
<br />
annoying too.  The Princess Sally Miniseries #1 intro said Antione is 
<br />
around for his military skills...  Well, why don't they portray THAT once
<br />
in a while (have him at least do 'something' good for the group even if he's
<br />
a klutz and a fraidy-cat).
<br />

<br />
Hrm.  This letter is getting pretty long.  I'm going to send the FAQ as a 
<br />
separate file.
<br />
