<br />
Ok this is the first chapter (And a little part of the second chapter.
<br />
) 
<br />
Enjoy!
<br />

<br />
Note: After certain consideration, I have decided not to make a 
<br />
continuation of &quot;From Amy Rose with Love&quot; Instead, this will not be 
<br />
based upon things that have happened in &quot;From Amy Rose with Love&quot;. 
<br />
Sorry to those of you who where hoping for a continuation, but I 
<br />
don't see how Sally and Antoine could go together. (Even though I 
<br />
came up with the idea in the first place)
<br />
I perfer to write storys that go on and on and on...... such as what 
<br />
I had planned to do in &quot;From Amy Rose with Love&quot;. Consider this the 
<br />
first of the series. Enjoy!
<br />

<br />
To Be or not to Be
<br />
Chapter One
<br />

<br />
Knothole II on the floating island.....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Knuckles, this is the last straw!!!!,&quot;Espio yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why? What did I do?!,&quot; Knuckles asked the chameleon. She turned 
<br />
her back to him. Vector leaned back in his chair at the meeting table,
<br />
&nbsp;studying a map of the island. There were several circles where they 
<br />
had spotted Mecha Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I saw you with that 'Princess Sally'! You kissed her, you know tha-
<br />
&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;She kissed me!! It was a kiss on the check! Besides you and me are 
<br />
not going together! Thats why I didn't conplain when you kissed 
<br />
Vector.&quot; Knuckles glares at Vector. The crocodile simply shrugs; in 
<br />
such a way as saying 'leave me out of this'.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Listen you two, drop it. We have much more important things to 
<br />
worry about, like finding Mecha,he has the chaos emerald after all!  
<br />
The floating island IS still falling!! Worry about personal matters 
<br />
later!,&quot;Vector said. Charmy Bee flew into the hut and almost knocked 
<br />
Vector over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right! There are more important things to do!&quot; Knuckles 
<br />
said. He was still hurt that his relationship with Espio was going 
<br />
down the drain, but there was time to talk that over later.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Charmy!,&quot; Espio called,&quot;Find Sonic. You are the only one who can 
<br />
get there the fastest. Tell him to- er here,&quot; Espio wrote out a note 
<br />
for Sonic. Charmy Bee couldn't speak and that was his only weakness. 
<br />
She handed the note to Charmy Bee. He looked it over, and gave her a 
<br />
quick thumbs up. Charmy Bee flew out of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What should I do?,&quot; Mighty the Armadillo asked Knuckles.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hmmmm. You and Alisa go evacuate the island. Heres the parachutes 
<br />
for every one. Oh! Heres two for you guys,&quot;  
<br />
The Chipmunk and the Armadillo gave Knuckles a thumbs up. Knuckles 
<br />
threw them the parachutes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well?,&quot;Vector asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Me and Espio will go hunt down Mecha. I think we will have an 
<br />
easier time finding him if we split up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You will stay here and wait for Sonic and the other freedom 
<br />
fighters.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sigh. I always get stuck with the boring stuff!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Chapter 2
<br />
......AND BRING SOME POWER RINGS. I HAVE A FEEL ING THAT THEY WILL 
<br />
WORK LIKE A CHAOS EMERALD.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whos crazy idea is this?!&quot; Sonic yelled at the Bee. He crumbeled 
<br />
up the paper. Charmy shrugged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIC! Little ole Ant left this note&quot; Bunnie said. She was 
<br />
practiculy in tears. &quot;It broke my little ole heart.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;.........AS BUNNIE REFERS TO ME AS HOW YOU SAY 'LITTLE OLE ANT' I 
<br />
HAVE FOUND SHE IZ RIGHT. I'M WORTHLESS. I RESIGN FROM THE FREEDOM 
<br />
FIGHTERS......
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, Antoine would never admit he was 'Little Ole Ant' it's 
<br />
just not an Ant thing to do.
<br />

<br />

<br />
To be continued.......
