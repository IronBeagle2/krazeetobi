Note: the following is off-topic, but I wanted to let everybody else have 
<br />
the opportunity to get involved in any further discussions...
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: AHVT94B_at_prodigy.com (MR THADDEUS R BOYD)
</em><br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, school's starting, which means I'm only going to be here on weekends
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the rest of the school-year...good news is, I've skipped 7th grade.
</em><br />
<br />Hmm, maybe I should forward you the logs I made from rec.org.mensa when I 
<br />
posted about this several months back - from what I remember of the 
<br />
follow-ups and e-mail replies, this wasn't universally a negative 
<br />
experience, but in general it was.  I posted about it to see if anybody 
<br />
else's experience was like mine: I skipped 5th grade, and have suffered 
<br />
socially for it ever since.  While it's possible that this still would have 
<br />
been the case had I not skipped the grade and thus been that much smarter 
<br />
than my colleagues, the fact that after skipping the grade I was still smarter
<br />
than most of them, _plus_ being a year behind them physically, pretty much 
<br />
destroyed any dating and other social opportunities I might have had...
<br />
<br />I don't mean for this to be a self-fulfilling prophecy for you though, so 
<br />
my advice is to take advantage of as many social opportunities as you can 
<br />
to get to know your new classmates and establish some good friendships if 
<br />
possible.  If you're into sports, go out for them, but hopefully the year's 
<br />
difference won't be too much to overcome (I'm not athletic, which was 
<br />
another strike against me).
<br />
<br />I'm curious as to whether or not any of this came up as an issue during 
<br />
the supposed discussions you had with your counselor, parents, etc.
<br />
<br />Anyway, if anybody wants to discuss this further, I suggest we take it to 
<br />
e-mail and not clutter up the list any more...
<br />
<br />Ron Bauerle
