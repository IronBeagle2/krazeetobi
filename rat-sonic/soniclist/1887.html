<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Why do the writers make Robotnik tell stupid jokes? Why jokes at all? He's a

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; madman who is allways in a bad mood. People in a bad mood (or, do to some

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; accidents involving the hedgehog, is in a terrible mood) dont tell jokes?!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Especially not _BAD_ jokes! And I think I saw some of you write that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Bloodlines (I loved that story) was too depressing. Well, of course it's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; depressing! Wars are allways depressing! There's a _HOLOCAUST_ going on for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; _at_#!%$# sakes! I mean, some stories write about a group that goes out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to plant bombs in a factory, the group is having fun, and the group is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; allways happy. WHAT ABOUT THE _WAR_?! Also Robotnik. Why is he portrayed as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; being so stupid? (Lot's of stories I have read have that) If he's an idiot,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Than the whole Mobius is made up of idiots! Robotnik, an &quot;evil GENIUS&quot;,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; outsmarted the whole world, and thus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; became the &quot;planet's overlord&quot;. Why doesn't anyone (or at least
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; only a very small amount of people) pay any attention to these

<em class="quotelev1">&gt; things!?

I know what you mean.  My very first post to rec.arts.animation dealt
<br />
with this topic.  I gave it the subject line &quot;Schizo The Hedgehog&quot; and
<br />
it concerned the difference in mood between the syndicated cartoon
<br />
series (wherein Robotnik is largely a buffoon) and the weekend animated
<br />
series that ran on ABC (wherein Robotnik has more of a Darth Vaderesque
<br />
air about him).
<br />

<br />
This schizophrenia continues even in the comics.  While some writers
<br />
(such as Kanterovich and Penders in the Sally Miniseries) can take the
<br />
&quot;fight&quot; in Freedom Fighters seriously, other writers like DeCesare and
<br />
Gallagher have to keep the jokes coming.  I've traded posts on this
<br />
subject with Paul Castiglia at Archie Comics (who used to work in
<br />
editing the comics before moving on to other Archie work and leaving
<br />
Sonic in the editorial hands of Scott Fulop).  Paul left the impression
<br />
that the comics have to pass review from representatives of SEGA who
<br />
insist that the material be kept &quot;light.&quot;  But there's a difference
<br />
between banter with a humorous edge, and going into some mindless
<br />
joke-telling mode.  Many of the Gallagher/Manak stories fit the latter
<br />
description.
<br />

<br />
Personally, I'm convinced that the Sonic team at Archie believes that
<br />
their primary readership consists of 8-12 year old boys.  As a result,
<br />
they are not about to explore some of the harder realities of the
<br />
conflict.  &quot;That's The Spirit&quot; in Sonic #20 came as close as they ever
<br />
have: still, the way the story was told and supported by Manak's artwork
<br />
undercut the poignancy of the plot [the freedom fighters believe that
<br />
Sonic is dead].  The Tails 2-part story &quot;Growing Pains&quot; in #28 and #29
<br />
was an even greater example of what could go wrong: quite aside from the
<br />
flaws in the story *per se*, it was hard to take Tails' heartbreak
<br />
seriously when he was stuck with such melodramatic prose.
<br />

<br />
Until such a time when SEGA authorizes an illustrated novel featuring
<br />
Sonic, I don't expect the situation to change at Archie any time soon.
<br />
In the meantime, those of us who aren't hesitant to deal with such
<br />
things can always post fanfic.
<br />

<br />
And I'm not just saying this because of your kind words about
<br />
&quot;Bloodlines,&quot; either!
