Assuming you mean information on specific episodes, rather than the cartoon
<br />
as a whole, I can do that.  (I sprung for the $1.50 for rental.  (:3)  Here
<br />
are a few episodes to get the ball rolling; hopefully, list-readers will

pipe up with more...

SONIC RACER
<br />
written by Len Janson
<br />

<br />
Sonic, Princess Sally, and Bunnie Rabbot are on a mission to disable one
<br />
of Robotnik's generator plants; Sonic distracts the Swatbots guarding the
<br />
plant, Sally shuts down the alarm systems, and Bunnie strongarms the
<br />
physical shields protecting the main computer controls.  After a little
<br />
button-pushing by Sally, the whole plant smokes quite nicely; Sonic
<br />
provides a warp-speed lift out of the area as Robotnik fumes. 
<br />

<br />
Sonic and Bunnie celebrate their success, but their celebration is
<br />
premature, as Sally points out; a backup generator kicks into operation. 
<br />
The Freedom Fighters return to Knothole to plan the assault on the backup
<br />
generator. Meanwhile, Snively suggests the old Robin Hood ploy to get
<br />
Sonic: a speed contest with a trophy to the winner. 
<br />

<br />
Sonic learns of the contest the next day and, predictably, expounds on how
<br />
easily he'll blow away the competition.  Sally points out that it's
<br />
probably just a trap, but Sonic notes that while Robotnik's chasing him,
<br />
the backup generator will be underdefended.  Snively and Robotnik,
<br />
meanwhile, are testing their secret weapon: a panther-like robot capable
<br />
of Sonic-level speeds.  That night, Bunnie reads a bedtime story to Tails;
<br />
Sally worries about Sonic's safety despite Tails and Bunnie's attempts to
<br />
reassure her. 
<br />

<br />
The next day (though it's always night in Robotropolis), the race is about
<br />
to get underway; as Robotnik waits for Sonic to show, Bunnie, Sally, and
<br />
Antoine sneak into the curiously deserted city.  Sonic makes his entrance
<br />
in a &quot;Little Red Rodent Hood&quot; disguise, expresses his disgust at the
<br />
caliber of his competition (a few hovers), and is in turn impressed as the
<br />
pantherbot makes its entrance at speed. 
<br />

<br />
The race begins, and Sonic and the bot are neck and neck (the hovers, as
<br />
expected, are no contest); the bot suddenly goes to full speed, and Sonic
<br />
loses his disguise as he hits his own 'afterburners'.  Robotnik releases
<br />
the first of a series of boobytraps on the course (laserbeams across the
<br />
track), but Sonic dodges them with a quick leap.  Nicole locates the
<br />
backup generator for Sally's group, but the question remains: how to get
<br />
past the guards that are still there? 
<br />

<br />
Sonic continues to deal with attempts on his life on the track while Sally
<br />
figures out how to get into the plant: climb up onto the roof and enter
<br />
through the skylight.  Unfortunately, while trying to get to the controls
<br />
of the plant, Antoine clutzes up, starting some machinery in action which
<br />
draws him along a conveyor towards crushing gears.  Bunnie is unable to
<br />
stop the works, so Sally sets off a flare, drawing Sonic off the race to
<br />
rescue the group.  Sonic jams the works with a Power Ring, which starts a
<br />
power reaction ultimately leading to the vaporization of the backup
<br />
generator; Sonic and the gang, of course, are long gone. 
<br />

<br />
Around the campfire back at Knothole, Sally and Sonic toast the lastest
<br />
victory for the Freedom Fighters. 
<br />

SONIC BOOM
<br />
written by Len Janson
<br />

<br />
Sonic, Antoine, and Cat (a one-shot character) break into one of
<br />
Robotnik's facilities, where they meet with Sally (who snuck in disguised
<br />
as one of the security robots).  Antoine and Cat stand guard as Sonic and
<br />
Sally work on disabling the Stealthbots awaiting launch there.  Sonic gets
<br />
increasingly edgy as security gets too close for comfort, but Sally's
<br />
received a puzzling message from the computer she's hacking: &quot;Bean&quot;, an
<br />
endearment her father used.  As she tracks the transmission to the Dark
<br />
Swamp, Antoine klutzes up again and is discovered by the patrol bots,
<br />
forcing a rapid withdrawl; Sonic runs interference while Sally bails out. 
<br />
Cat is separated from the group during the escape and is captured. 
<br />

<br />
Sonic finds out about Cat's capture and heads back to find him; Sally
<br />
takes Antoine to the Swamp to track down the message.  Robotnik attempts
<br />
to interrogate Cat, but gets no information; he sends the feline to a
<br />
holding cell, where he is found by Sonic.  Sonic finds out from Cat that
<br />
Robotnik knows where Sally's going and is forced to abandon his rescue
<br />
attempt by concentrated weapons fire; he heads off to the swamp to save
<br />
Sally. 
<br />

<br />
Sally and Antoine, meanwhile, have discovered that the only structure in
<br />
the swamp is Ironlock Prison, which has been abandoned for 100 years. They
<br />
decide to check it out while Sonic and a Stealthbot both persue; Sonic
<br />
spots and destroys the Stealthbot as Sally and Antoine enter the prison. 
<br />
Sally finds a section of her father's royal cloak, then an ancient
<br />
computer, and Sonic finds them.  The computer contains a partial message,
<br />
proving Sally's father is alive (or at least was until recently), and a
<br />
map of tunnel complexes providing access to the entirety of Robotropolis. 
<br />
Unfortunately, the computer is also boobytrapped, and Sonic accidentally
<br />
sets off the trap, dumping them all into an underground passage. 
<br />

<br />
A giant monster approaches, but Sonic powers through it with a Power Ring,
<br />
revealing it to be a robotic creation.  Sally uses the maps to lead the
<br />
group back to the Stealthbot hangar, where they finish the mission they
<br />
set out to perform.  Their task complete, Sonic sets off to rescue Cat,
<br />
but the cell is empty.  The group makes their escape and watches the light
<br />
show as the Stealthbots, sent to pursue them, self-destruct. 
<br />
