Last night I typed up this FAQ based mostly on the Archie comic book series
<br />
as.  Its a start but could use a bit of feedback and input from the 
<br />
television series.

<br />

<br />
5 Hyper-Sonic: Up to twice the speed of sound... don't 'mach' me out!
<br />
6 Warp-Sonic:  Lite speed - 1/3 faster than your regular bulb!
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Robotnic's Rules (From Sonic #3)
<br />
1 No Reading
<br />
2 No Laughing
<br />
3 No Live Plants
<br />
4 ... (I don't have issue #3.. can someone help me?)
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Questions and Answers!
</em><br />

<br />
Q:  What speed setting does Sonic have to go for his legs to turn into 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those swirly things?
<br />

<br />
A:  Trans-Sonic
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  What color is Sally's hair?
<br />

<br />
A:  Good question!  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sonic Miniseries 0 it was blond with red fur.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Sonic Miniseries 1-3 and Sonic 1-15 she's a brunette with pink fur.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic 16 and after she's a red-head with brown fur, just like on TV.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(They explained the color changes in SonicGrams #16; Archie writers had 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little material to base her on until the TV series came out)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a side note:  The comic book tends to follow both the Saturday and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weekday television series but follows the Saturday series more closely.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  What species is Sally?
<br />

<br />
A:  Squirrel! (Given in SonicGrams #5, #14, #16 and #17)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ground squirrel according to SonicGrams #19)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  What species is Antoine?
<br />

<br />
A:  Fox (Given in SonicGrams #12)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  Sonic's Favorite Food?
<br />

<br />
A:  Chili Dogs!  &quot;My favorite food gives me alot of.. 'Jet Propultion'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Yup.. thats what Sonic said in SonicGrams #12 .. eeeww)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  How did Tails get his 2nd tail?
<br />

<br />
A:  Reader mail in Sonic #2 gives a few possibilities:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Tails is a mutant!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Tails was created in Dr. Frankenstein's Lab
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Tails has Antoine's tail!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[(3) is my favorite]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reply in SonicGrams #9 states he was born that way.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A reply in SonicGrams #16 states Antoine gave his tail to Tails so he
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could fly.  Hrm.. I guess (3) is Sonic's favorite answer too!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added comment:  (1) is the most plausable in my opinion.  With 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik polluting everything you're bound to find some mutants.
<br />

<br />
Q:  How did Bunnie Rabbot get her robot arm and legs?
<br />

<br />
A:  Sonic saved Bunnie from being Roboticized but not before she gained 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some robotic parts. (Given in SonicGrams #16)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  Why is Miles Prower called Tails?
<br />

<br />
A:  Its a nickname.  He prefers Tails over Miles (wouldn't you?)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  How old is Sonic?
<br />

<br />
A:  Back in SonicGrams #7 Sonic didn't want to reveal his age, but he 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eventually said he was 15 (SonicGrams #16 and #18)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  How old is Sally?
<br />

<br />
A:  Also 15 (SonicGrams IYF#1 and #20)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  How old is Tails?
<br />

<br />
A:  Somewhere I heard he was 4 (perhaps a Sega Vision's magazine.. I 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;couldn't find it in SonicGrams) but a recent TV episode said he's 10.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This seems a bit more plausable given Tail's personality.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  Where is Mobius?
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
A:  SonicGrams #9 says the planet is in an unspecified point in space.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Cop-out answer)
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q:  Who was the king of Mobius?
<br />

<br />
A:  Sonic #10 shows a picture of the king.  He looks alot like an old male
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;version of Sally.  This contradicts the TV series where he looked alot
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like a fox.  Sonic #17 first shows the king as he appears on TV as a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fox (in Princess Sally's Crusade).
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added note:  Very strange to be a squirrel princess while having a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fox king.  Perhaps Sally is an adopted daughter (or a daughter by
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;marriage)
<br />

<br />

<br />
*   Boomer was renamed Rotor to match the TV series in issue 6 (in a 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dicken's parody).  The issue was hammered home issue 9.
<br />
**  A poster had Bunnie in MS1 but she was not in any storylines until ???.
<br />
*** Snively first appears in #6 in a Dicken's Christmas Carol parody but
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was called 'Jacob Snarley'
<br />

<br />

<br />
Feel free to make additions and corrections.  Remember this is based 
<br />
almost entirely on the Archie comic series.
<br />

<br />
Also.. Anyone know where I can get Sonic Miniseries issue #3?  I can 
<br />
back-order the others which I don't have.
