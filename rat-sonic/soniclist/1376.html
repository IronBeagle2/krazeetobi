<br />Part 4
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, no, Antoine!  Like this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd demonstrated the kick yet again as Tolouse and Tails looked on.  Then,
<br />
again, Antoine tried to mimic it, with disastrous results.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails giggled and Tolouse shook his head and chuckled as Antoine picked 
<br />
himself up from having fallen over.  Again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Zat was better, yes?&quot; Antoine asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh...  Maybe we should try something else,&quot; Todd suggested.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No no really, I am wanting to learn zis.  Here, I try again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse helped Antoine back up from another attempt.  &quot;Yeah, let's do 
<br />
something else...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been two weeks since Todd had first arrived in Knothole, and in that
<br />
time, he had made himself at home.  Perhaps it was because they were all foxes, 
<br />
or perhaps it was because their histories were similar, each having lost family 
<br />
to the forces of Robotropolis, but in that time, Todd, Tails, and Tolouse had 
<br />
become good friends.  Now, they were out on a camping trip, deep within the 
<br />
forest and quite a distance from Knothole.  Antoine had come with them as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why not?&quot; Tolouse had said.  &quot;The poor fox is lonely.  Besides, we could 
<br />
use the entertainment.&quot;  The others had laughed in agreement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd was showing off his skills again.  He whirled around, and a nearby 
<br />
tree branch was splintered by a kick.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool!&quot; Tails said in awe, and the others were equally impressed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of them noticed a small device hovering behind them in the darkness.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir, rebel freedom fighters have been sighted,&quot; the Swat-Bot stated. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell looked at the screen and chuckled.  &quot;Excellent!  That is the one 
<br />
we are looking for.&quot;  All but ignoring Todd's show, he focused the spy-bot's 
<br />
camera on Tails and smiled.  Tonight, he would set his plan into action.  And to
<br />
kidnap him out from underneath the noses of three of his friends, he thought in 
<br />
anticipation.  How will they be able to live with themselves, knowing that poor,
<br />
poor Tails was taken from right in front of them, and then killed for all of 
<br />
them to see?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an easy question.  They won't.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as long as I have anything to do with it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Swat-bots, start with the preparations for our guest.  Then let me know 
<br />
when our campers have fallen asleep.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Commander,&quot; was the automatic reply.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An android hand slipped quickly over his muzzle, and before Tails was even 
<br />
fully awake, he felt himself being carried off into the night.  He tried to 
<br />
scream, but no sound could emerge from his closed mouth.  He soon felt something
<br />
that was all too familiar:  the clamp of a Swat-Bot's metallic hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Keep him quiet until we have left the area.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails squirmed helplessly in the Swat-Bot's grip as Packbell's hovercraft 
<br />
left the area, the engines as quiet as Packbell could make them.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at the campsite, the remaining three foxes slept on.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, Antoine, wake up!  He's gone!&quot;  Todd was near panic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse struggled to clear the haze of sleep from his head.  &quot;Who?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails!  He's gone!  I can't find him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sleep was winning the battle.  &quot;He probably just went into the woods.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, he hasn't.  He's gone!  Look at this!&quot;  Todd handed Tolouse a pad that
<br />
he had found where Tails had been sleeping.  Tolouse slowly managed to focus his
<br />
eyes...and they flew open wide when he did.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention Freedom Fighters:
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to see your friend alive again, you will come to the old
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Museum of Arts building by the end of the day.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely: Commander Packbell
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse quickly got up.  &quot;Okay, let's get back to Knothole and tell the 
<br />
others.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd shook his head.  &quot;No way.  I'm going after him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do what?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know where that building is, I remember seeing it when I was in the 
<br />
city.  I'm going now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Todd, wait!  Sonic will be able to get us there much faster, and he and 
<br />
Sally need to know about this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fine, you tell them, but I know if I start now, I can make it there in 
<br />
plenty of time.&quot;   He took off into the woods, at a sprint that Tolouse knew he 
<br />
wouldn't have been able to keep up with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Todd!&quot; he shouted, but the fox kept running, and was soon out of sight in 
<br />
the dense forest.  Tolouse sighed, but he knew what he had to do.  If they were 
<br />
lucky, they could make it back to Knothole before the sun was too high.  
<br />
&quot;Antoine, wake up!&quot;
<br />
<br />To be continued
