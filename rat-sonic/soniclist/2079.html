&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part the third
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak stared at all of the dishes laid at the Princess'
<br />
table.  Fine meats, breads, cheeses, vegetables, soups, wines,
<br />
ales...  And all to his way of thinking inedible.  A barbarian's
<br />
tastes invariably run to simpler fare.  But the ingredient's were
<br />
there, and so he began the rather peculiar construction of a
<br />
sausage and bread layer again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sniffing at a thick, reddish-brown stew, he asked, &quot;What's
<br />
this?  Smells good.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The princess thought for a moment, and replied, &quot;Well, it's a
<br />
sort of spiced bean and meat stew.  Onions, red peppers, some
<br />
spices...  Not a favorite of mine, actually, but the cook loves to
<br />
make it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak paused, then ladles some of it onto the sausage
<br />
construct.  Tentatively, he took a bite--
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And smiled.  Widely.  &quot;Perfect.  The perfect food.  At last,
<br />
I have found the perfect food.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sausage, bread, cheese and bean stew is the perfect food?&quot;
<br />
whispered Bunnie to her Princess.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It would seem to be,&quot; replied Salar-Alicia.  &quot;Look at him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie stared in open-mouth disbelief as the hedgehog rapidly
<br />
constructed six of the bizarre items, and wolfed them down with
<br />
unexpected speed.  &quot;The PERFECT food!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he began to pull at a mug of ale, the guard captain shook
<br />
her head.  Her princess was obviously taken with the stranger, and
<br />
she wasn't sure that that was wise at all.  Princesses weren't
<br />
meant to be close to commoners, much less to fast-eating
<br />
barbarians.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak's idea of the perfect food was being shared at that
<br />
moment by Tail's gang of street-rats.  Oh, they hadn't created the
<br />
odd compound that the barbarian had, but Tail's theft had paid for
<br />
bread, cheese, sausages, and some (rather thin) bean stew, as well
<br />
as a jug of sour wine that they had cut with water.   To the
<br />
princess, or even the hedgehog, the meal would have been sparse.
<br />
To the assembled urchins, it was a feast as grand as any at the
<br />
palace (or so they fondly believed, in a Cratchet-like fashion).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The four younger ones were as happy as clams (Hmm... You know,
<br />
that's a rather unusual phrase.  I mean, how happy can a clam be?
<br />
No brain, almost no nervous system, existing only for the purpose
<br />
of chowder, but I digress) but Milos was somewhat more somber.  The
<br />
silver piece had bought a deal of foodstuffs, but it was gone now,
<br />
and such a lucky haul was not a regular occurrence.  At the age of
<br />
eleven years he was a bit more of a realist than his gang.  True,
<br />
his unusual gift of flight gave him some advantage, but not
<br />
enough...  Not to steal something worth stealing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, if he were to go for a real prize, it would certainly
<br />
attract the attention of the Guild of Thieves, who might not care
<br />
about a wild urchin grabbing the occasional silver, but would
<br />
certainly be annoyed at one not in the Brotherhood performing any
<br />
real theft.  And there was always the small, nagging guilt he felt
<br />
at each pickpocketing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there were only some alternative.  But he had to keep his
<br />
charges fed, somehow, and the number of jobs for an eleven year old
<br />
fox could be counted on the fingers of his left foot.  At best he
<br />
could gain apprenticeship to some brute, for little more than food
<br />
or board, and that would not help his friends...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A thought occurred to him.  There was enough food for tomorrow
<br />
as well, except bread.  Sometimes the Palace cooks could be
<br />
persuaded to give a crust of three to a appropriately pitiful
<br />
looking waif.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cleth, come with me.  We're going to see if we can get any
<br />
bread for tomorrow.  Get pathetic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cleth, the kitten, grinned.  Only five years of age, he often
<br />
treated the plots that Tails cooked up like a game, and &quot;get
<br />
pathetic&quot; was one of his favorites.  Removing the ragged but clean
<br />
tunic he wore (Tails insisted on keeping what clothing they had in
<br />
as good repair as possible, and even on weekly bathing-- to cut
<br />
down on odors that might give them away) he donned a mass of dirty,
<br />
shredded rags that made him look as though he had not eaten in a
<br />
month, had been beaten daily in compensation, and more like three
<br />
or four years old.  He opened his eyes wide, until they resembles
<br />
something that in another universe would have been painted on black
<br />
velvet, and generated a hint of a practiced tear.  Perhaps even
<br />
Roboth-amon would have had a moment of tenderness at the kitten's
<br />
demeanor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so Tails and Cleth set out on what was planned as a
<br />
begging expedition, but what would turn out to be-- aw, you know.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As two cubs set out for the back of the palace, a black-clad
<br />
figure also made his way towards the royal residence.  Holding a
<br />
small green stone with obscure glyphs inscribed upon it, Sniv
<br />
effortlessly scales a wall, entered a window, and hid the item
<br />
under a bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving as silently as he had come, the master thief and spy
<br />
of the eastlands returned to his room at the disreputable inn he
<br />
was patronizing.  Again he withdrew the mirror that was his means
<br />
of communication with his dark master.  (Yes, I know, but the
<br />
phrase Dark Master is traditional in this kind of fantasy.)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is in place, Master,&quot;  Sniv said quietly.  &quot;Um... If I may
<br />
ask, what is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again the mirror swirled, again the shadowed form of Roboth-
<br />
amon  appeared.  &quot;A beacon of sorts, Sniv.  A beacon for a spell of
<br />
transport.  Also a window into the mirrors of the princess's
<br />
chambers.  I shall see just how capable this barbarian is for
<br />
myself.  Then, after I appraise him... I shall break him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And even the hardened soul of Sniv the Unseen, master spy of
<br />
the Eastrealm, shuddered at the cold laughter that emanated from
<br />
the mirror...
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TO BE CONTINUED
<br />
