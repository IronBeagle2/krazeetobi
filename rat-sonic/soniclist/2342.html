<br />
After reading several of the postings and checking out some of the SONIC
<br />
web-sites, as one of the main writers (and sometime artist) on Archie's SONIC
<br />
series, I thought I'd give a behind-the-scenes peek of what goes on in the
<br />
making of a typical issue.
<br />

<br />
Actually, there isn't any such animal as a typical issue, as each story is a
<br />
unique entity unto themselves. We're always trying to come up with something
<br />
different, fun and exciting that tops what we've already done. Hopefully,
<br />
people are going to have fun and enjoy the finished work when it comes out.
<br />

<br />
Readers have inquired into many aspects about the world of SONIC, especially
<br />
aspects of the characters and the continuity of the stories as they relate to
<br />
each other. Mike Kanterovich and I have always taken the attitude that
<br />
writing SONIC and his friends should be approached as if we were writing
<br />
BATMAN or SPIDER-MAN. That is, this a character that people like and we are
<br />
just mere chroniclers of his adventures. We never treat it as if it were just
<br />
another job, or &quot;only&quot; a funny animals story. 
<br />

<br />
There are some aspects in writing the book that are simply beyond the control
<br />
of the editors at Archie Comics or we the writers. SEGA has the final say on
<br />
everything, even if they contridict themselves. I've recently seen SONIC
<br />
comics that were produced in Britain. My initial reaction ranged from one of
<br />
envy, because for many and various reasons, we simply can't do stories like
<br />
that for Archie, no matter how much we may want to, to feelings of disbelief,
<br />
that SEGA would allow stories published where SONIC appears so &quot;off-model&quot;.
<br />
If you only knew how many times the artists at Archie have been told to
<br />
correct the spines on SONIC because the drawings looked off-model, and then
<br />
along comes offically approved stories that feature drawings that came out of
<br />
a Mike Gallagher script. (No disrepect to Mike is intended or inferred, as
<br />
I'm sure he'd be the first one to agree.)
<br />

<br />
One aspect that's been very difficult to handle has been the issue of
<br />
continuity. Mike and I have always tried to keep our stories within the
<br />
established framework while adding new pieces to the puzzle, so to speak, and
<br />
in the course of producing SONIC'S adventures, it's just not possible to be
<br />
aware of what every writer on every SONIC story is up to, so there are going
<br />
to be inconsistencies from time to time. I've just turned in the script for
<br />
issue #44. There's a chance I may have to make a revision or two based on
<br />
what occurs in #43. (The scripts I turned in for #38 and 39 were pushed back
<br />
to #41 and 42, respectively.) Right now, I've submitted a plot synopsis for
<br />
ENDGAME, a four issue spectacular that begins in issue #47 and concludes in
<br />
#50, with an ending that changes the status quo in SONIC considerably. As a
<br />
matter of fact, a harbinger of things to come can be found in SONIC #36 as
<br />
well as the KNUCKLES mini-series.
<br />

<br />
Speaking of KNUCKLES, I'd like to clarify a point here for the confused and
<br />
frustrated. The 2-page stories as seen in issues #31 through #33 were NOT
<br />
part of the story originally. The 8-page stories you will see in #34 through
<br />
36 WERE what was SUPPOSED to be there. What happened was this:
<br />

<br />
Comics are solicited to the comics shop months ahead of time. Retailers place
<br />
their orders based on what they believe they can sell. Whatever they order,
<br />
they HAVE to buy. If Archie promises a KNUCKLES story in an issue of SONIC,
<br />
and the retailer orders the book based on the information he has been
<br />
provided with, and the book appears with NO KNUCKLES story, then the retailer
<br />
can return the book. With me so far? Okay then. Archie promised KNUCKLES
<br />
stories in SONIC #31 through #33. AFTER these books were solicited to the
<br />
retailers, word came in that a traditionally NON-COMICS BIG TIME retailer
<br />
wanted to carry the KNUCKLES MINI-SERIES. The ONLY way this could be done was
<br />
if the series release date was PUSHED BACK three months. Scott Fulop, then
<br />
editor of SONIC, had only days to turn in issue #31 to the printers. He had
<br />
to make a decision and he had to make it quick. There WASN&quot;T any way he could
<br />
get an all-new story written and drawn and APPROVED BY SEGA in under a week's
<br />
time. It's just NOT possible. So he asked Mike and I to do two-page fillers
<br />
to keep the story going so we could by-pass the process in having to get
<br />
another story approved. Since 2 pages was all that could be written,
<br />
pencilled, lettered, inked and colored in the alloted time in order to get
<br />
#31 to the printers, it was decided to stick to that format for the next two
<br />
issues. Nobody was happy with this. Scott, Mike and I anticipated that
<br />
readers would feel cheated with this, but we hope when they get to the full
<br />
stories, all will be forgiven.
<br />

<br />
I've received some mail on the stories we do, and I've found that writing for
<br />
SONIC is quite a balancing act. Take &quot;Sonic Shot&quot; in issue #33, for instance.
<br />
For the most part, the younger readers liked it, while some adults thought it
<br />
bland. In this case, I'd have to go with the opinions of the younger readers
<br />
because it was they who inspired the story and for whom it was intended. For
<br />
those who criticized that some parts stretched credulity because, for
<br />
example, it wasn't possible for Robotnik to communicate with SONIC as shown,
<br />
my answer is this. I only had EIGHT pages to play with. I decided to focus on
<br />
plot, pacing, fun and sportsmanship. If I had a page or two more,  I could've
<br />
gone into more detail, but sometimes part of what gets you through a story is
<br />
by letting the readers fill in the blanks. While Mike and I generally go for
<br />
a more middle-of-the-road approach in aiming the stories at both younger and
<br />
older readers, the fact of the matter is that a LOT of SONIC readers are
<br />
primarily a younger audience, and once in awhile we'll do something
<br />
specifically for them.
<br />

<br />
If anyone has questions they'd like to field my way, feel free to do so. If
<br />
you have story ideas for submission to Archie, by all means, I encourage you
<br />
to try. You may get lucky. One word of caution: we're in the midst of
<br />
planning stories that take us to issue #60. No scripts have been planned or
<br />
written after #50 as yet, but issue #50 does present some really special
<br />
surprises in store for the readers, so any writer interested in submitting
<br />
should be prepared to make whatever changes necessary to the story to conform
<br />
with the continuity as it's being set up. (And no, I'm not going to give the
<br />
game away at this point.)  
<br />

<br />
Take care and thanks for your interest.
