<br />
Part 7.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An ear-splitting scream filled the room.  Sonic, Sally, and 
<br />
Bookshire turned around to see Tolouse sitting up, eyes shut tight and 
<br />
voice in full volume, in utter terror.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse!  Tolouse!  You're okay, Tolouse!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All three crowded around him, trying to stop the violent 
<br />
convulsions of his body.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, calm down!  You're safe!  You're safe!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slowly, agonizingly slowly, Tolouse's trembling ceased, and his 
<br />
eyes opened wide with shock.  He looked around, not recognizing 
<br />
anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic leaned over.  &quot;Tolouse!  It's me Sonic, your buddy!  Your 
<br />
okay, pal!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic...Sonic...oh, gods!!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse seized Sonic and hugged him tightly, sobbing 
<br />
uncontrollably.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally breathed a sigh of relief, and Bookshire nodded.  &quot;He'll be 
<br />
okay,&quot; he whispered to her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse refused to let Sonic go, and he cried non-stop for the next 
<br />
half-hour.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two days later, Tolouse visited Sally's hut for a talk.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am sorry, Tolouse.  I...&quot;  She hesitated.  &quot;I don't know if I 
<br />
can say anything that will comfort you.  Everybody at this village has a 
<br />
story to tell, about the pain they have suffered and the loss that they 
<br />
have experienced at the hands of Robotnik.  Mostly it has been common 
<br />
understanding that comforts us.  No words need be spoken.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse nodded.  The words were slow in coming out of him as well.  
<br />
&quot;I...I have been doing a lot of thinking...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;And?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the fear had subsided, but uncertainty had taken its place.  
<br />
&quot;Since...I got caught and the mission had to be aborted...I was 
<br />
wondering...am I still...a Freedom Fighter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Tolouse,&quot; Sally said gently, shaking her head and smiling.  
<br />
&quot;You warned us at the plant when there was danger.  Because of that, 
<br />
Sonic and Bunnie were able to get out of the plant before they were 
<br />
seen.  I couldn't have asked for a better job from you.  You are an 
<br />
honorable Freedom Fighter.  But, Tolouse...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Having seen...what you have,&quot; she spoke, her voice almost a 
<br />
whisper, &quot;I am concerned for you.  Your experiences are very unique, and 
<br />
you have seen first-hand just how demented Robotnik is.  I must ask:  Do 
<br />
you wish to continue on as a Freedom Fighter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse sat in silence, thinking.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally nodded.  &quot;You don't have to answer today, and if you say no, 
<br />
there isn't a soul in this village who would blame you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Tolouse had already made up his mind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood up and said in a voice with new-found confidence, &quot;Sally, 
<br />
I wish to go on as a Freedom Fighter.  I have dedicated my life to it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked back at him.  &quot;Are you sure?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I am very sure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well.&quot;  She smiled broadly.  &quot;I did not want to say this 
<br />
before I knew for sure, but I am very glad that you will continue with 
<br />
us.  You have more than proven yourself to the cause.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse exhaled with relief.  &quot;Thank you, Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, Tolouse.  Now go on, scoot.  Make sure Sonic isn't 
<br />
making a nuisance of himself somewhere.&quot;  She giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse smiled, &quot;Okay.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he closed the door to her hut, a shiver ran through his body.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those eyes, those piercing, red eyes...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He shook his head, clearing it.  That is in the past now, he told 
<br />
himself.  And I am still alive, and I am still going to fight!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Y'all 'right, sugar?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked up and saw Bunnie standing a few feet away.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm fine, Bunnie.  I am fine.&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us live to tell our story
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here on Earth and out in space
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Forward on the road to glory
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History records the chase!
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the ice of frozen lakes, run with the fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Along the lanes a lover takes, run with the fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beneath the moon, a Christmas moon, run with the fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And sing a tune, a lover's tune, run with the fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Across the Bridge of Many Ways, run with the fox.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Onto the plains where dreamers play, run with the fox.
<br />

<br />
---The End.
<br />

<br />
The saga will continue, in &quot;On My Mother's Grave&quot;.
<br />

<br />
