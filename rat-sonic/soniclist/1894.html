<em class="quotelev1">&gt;This schizophrenia continues even in the comics.  While some writers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(such as Kanterovich and Penders in the Sally Miniseries) can take the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&quot;fight&quot; in Freedom Fighters seriously, other writers like DeCesare and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Gallagher have to keep the jokes coming.  
</em><br />

<br />
I understand what you mean, and I must say that I've noticed a degree of
<br />
inconsistency in the writing styles, myself. I really think they could do
<br />
more to ensure that the storylines and the character development are more
<br />
consistent on an issue to issue basis. Sometimes I put down an issue and I
<br />
think, &quot;Jeez, that was cool!&quot; Other times, I feel like I'm Mr. Rogers.
<br />
&quot;Hello boys and girls. Can you say 'plot?' Sure you can!&quot;
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Paul left the impression
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that the comics have to pass review from representatives of SEGA who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;insist that the material be kept &quot;light.&quot;  But there's a difference
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;between banter with a humorous edge, and going into some mindless
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;joke-telling mode.  
</em><br />

<br />
If it is true that Sega has a large say in what the comics turn out to be
<br />
like, then I say they're shooting themselves in the foot by harming the
<br />
characters in this way. THEY NEED MORE DISTINCT PERSONALITIES WITH MORE
<br />
EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION. It's that simple. I don't suppose anybody was a fan of
<br />
the Ninja Turtles series which was put out by Archie? In it's final 2 years,
<br />
I truly enjoyed what they were doing with it. They explored the characters'
<br />
emotions and the writers were creating very intricate plotlines, with
<br />
complex themes. They just kept setting up more interesting events making you
<br />
drool in anticipation of the next issue. Sonic just seems to be turning into
<br />
a Joke-a-Thon more and more with each passing issue. The emotional and
<br />
character development just isn't there, and when an attempt is made, it
<br />
usually falls flat on it's face because it just doesn't fit in.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Personally, I'm convinced that the Sonic team at Archie believes that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their primary readership consists of 8-12 year old boys.  As a result,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they are not about to explore some of the harder realities of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;conflict.
</em><br />

<br />
This fact may be due to Sega's influence, as well. I believe that 8-12 year
<br />
olds are Sega's main target audience for...(guess what?) the Sonic the
<br />
Hedgehog games.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Until such a time when SEGA authorizes an illustrated novel featuring
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sonic, I don't expect the situation to change at Archie any time soon.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In the meantime, those of us who aren't hesitant to deal with such
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;things can always post fanfic.
</em><br />

<br />
Such a thing would truly be cool. Since it is doubtful that this is going to
<br />
happen, however, I hope that all of you budding authors out there continue
<br />
to share your talents with us. Keep the fan fic coming! I can't get enough
<br />
of it. We can only hope that Sega doesn't poke their nose into this area
<br />
like they did the pics. Until that happens, I'm going to be optimistic.
<br />
Let's also hope that something happens to wake Sega and Archie up. 
<br />
Good goals for 1996, wouldn't you say? :) 
<br />

<br />

<br />
