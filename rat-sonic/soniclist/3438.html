<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    The first event that turned me toward dislike of the management of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;this list is one that could probably be concieved as a nearly inflammatory
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;move on the part of Eric, which was to utilize a posting of mine in order
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to set down a new `list rule'.  What transpired was that in the beginning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of my fanfic-writing career, I made it a habit to publish my stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on the mailing list directly, and then have Bookshire grep them from his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;mailspool and HTMLize it for fanfic-page consumption.  I had not seen a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;single post on said list about anyone disliking my practice of doing this,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and had, in fact, recieved a few positive comments.  This not only
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;encouragedme to continue my writings, but it also gave me a mandate to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;continue this practice further.  Well, after I had sent one of my stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the list on one fateful afternoon, Eric decided to take the opportunity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to put down a new list rule.  Can anyone tell me what it is?  No?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, it was that no further stories were to be sent to the list.  He used
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the header of my posting, deleted all of the content of the message (even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the `On such-and-such day, X said:' line), and said in no uncertain terms &gt;that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;no further fanfic was to be sent to the list.  That's all.  No `good
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;story, Joe', no `awful story, Joe', no `nice paragraphing, Joe', but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;instead a subtle incrimination that it was -MY- fault that this new
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;policy was being instituted.  Real fucking nice, man.  Yet, I kept
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my mouth closed, and instead did what I was instructed to.  The deep-rooted
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;indignation that I possess now was absent in me then, so I meekly shut up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and obeyed.
</em><br />

<br />
&lt;Shakes head&gt; It wasn't just YOU, man...I had the SAME THING happen to ME.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     However, my ire was rose when people CONTINUED, -TOTALLY- unflamed,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to post fanfic to the list (and multi-part fanfic, I might add) and were,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in fact, APPLAUDED by the admins!
</em><br />

<br />
&lt;Shrugs&gt; I only saw one story after the rule was made (before getting
<br />
kicked-off), and I think that was because the writer wrote in from a BBS
<br />
and didn't have any way of knowing about the change in customs...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The second incident that rose my bile to a frothing cauldron of rage
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;was a posting I had made that I thought was not only Sonic-related, but
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;dealt with the problem we had at the time with Sega's legal staff regarding
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the `hentai' pics Bookshire had on the page at the time.  A posting on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;alt.slack caught my eye during that time period that dealt with a similar
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;case that Warner Brothers was placing against a similar collection of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;porno pics of toons.  Seeing that this would be a good morale-booster
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;for the depressed inhabitants on the list, I chose to grep the article
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;from my local NNTP server, edit it a little, and post it onto the list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It seemed quite obvious to myself and my close friends that this was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a completely on-topic post, and it would be, in fact, appreciated by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;all members of the list.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     As expected, Ratman (with his utter mastery of the King's English,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not to mention his totally superior abilities in detecting -CONTEXT-)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;*flamed* me for putting the article on the list, calling it one of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;most foul, odious, noxious, degrading, and generally Pink things that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;one 'net surfer can call another 'net surfer's transmissions: `spam'.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Needless to say, it took a far larger expenditure of willpower to not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;utterly blast Ratman off the face of the earth with my verbal gymnastics,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but I was able to again contain my rage.
</em><br />

<br />
No disagreement HERE.  *I* certainly thought a BLIND person could've seen
<br />
the connection in said incident.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     The third slap in the face that I refused to allow my primal instincts
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to attack was not even directed toward me, but rather toward the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;inhabitantsof the list as a whole.  This was an incident best outlined as a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;general`policy' issue, but it was a very sensitive one for me.  Now, I know
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;operators of mailing lists have the right to say whatever they want on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the list that they operate.  I have no qualms about that right, nor would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I demand it be removed due to the interests of fair and free speech.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;However, during an otherwise slow time for the list, an interesting,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;but somewhat off-topic thread began; it dealt with the fanfic video game
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(that is still under production, BTW), and the general roles people might
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;play in it.  I thought it was amusing enough, and didn't feel it took up
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too much of my mail spool with BS.  After all, it is a simple thing to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;delete 30 messages a day; any jackass with a decent mail-reader can do
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that in one keystroke.  Yet, after a while, Ratman started bitching about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it because he had obviously lost interest in it.  There was a brief
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;verbal scuffle, which can be supported by said members of the discussion,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and I felt that neither side was totally in the right...in fact, if it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;hadn't been for Ratman's creation of a video-game list, I bet this list
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;would have finally collapsed a long time ago.  But it takes two to tango,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;petit, and this therefore can be seen as yet another reason I am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;unhappy with Ratman's performance.
</em><br />

<br />
&lt;Nods&gt; My reaction to that was what got me kicked-off...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Fourth was perpetrated by Ratman just hours ago, when he had the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sheer gonads to dare speak afoul of one of the most brilliant,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;skilled, and generally superior human beings I have had the pleasure of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;reviewing the work of, Dan Drazen.  He is probably one of the nicest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;people I have ever read the work of, and does more for Sonic fandom
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;in general than most people could ever concieve of.  His writings about
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the Sonic comic are insightful and fair, and his fanfic is probably
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;several million times better than anything I could ever dream of writing.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;In fact, I'd dare say that he could write `Nanny nanny boo boo' a million
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;times, post it, and I'd -still- like the guy.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     But, as Ratman was totally expected to do (I was tempted to start
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a pool when I saw Drazen's alledgedly `irritating' post), he went off
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;on this great man like he was a common spammer, dissing him far too
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;strongly in front of the entire list for acknoledging a quite...interesting
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;comment written by an obvious nutcase.  He should have been commended for
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;adding even a spittle of thought toward that individual, not crucified and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;chastised by the hominid rodentia for making a minor `fluff' post.  It's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;not like the list was overloaded with spam at the time, anyway.
</em><br />

<br />
I know...he probably was in a bad mood, or he would've let it pass.  I
<br />
agree wholly, except I don't think his writing's several million times
<br />
better than MINE...just a couple hundred.  ;)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     And now, the fifth reason is Ratman's actual shutting down of the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;list for reasons that have allegedly stretched back into the past.  He
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;says that the system load for him is too much (sure, pal...and I suppose
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the ten billon Mortal Kombat wankers that hit your site every time another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;edition of that blasted game is released doesn't put an infinitesimally
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;higher amount of strain on that ISP of yours than some &lt; 50 K mail messages
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that are in-and-out in less than 2 minutes), and that the signal-to-noise
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratio is too low (one jerk spams us with 5 messages, and two other people
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are learning how to use their mail programs...meanwhile, meaningful
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;discussion continues unabated), or that alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;be a better place, anyway (and he -admits- it's more difficult than he
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;initially said to get your average po'bucker admin to add a newsgroup to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;your local NNTP spool, especially if it's an alt.* group...also, Quozl
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;himself could tell you that the average sysop is probably already wary
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog group because it was allegedly created by
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Tom Servo-ish methods...you think getting alt.tv.k-t-e is hard to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cajole your sysop into, just wait until he sees your request for a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;group that was allegedly made by Tom Servo!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     Now, in my opinion, this action was taken strictly as a tantrumish
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lashing-out at those of us who may have offended his sensitive
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sensibilities once too often, or that one was less articulate than he would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;prefer, or even just because he'd stubbed his toe that morning.  Who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;frigging knows?  All I know is that this action is totally uncalled for,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and that any human being with a sense of justice left within them would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;stand up and -say- something about it.  His current rationale does not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wash well with me, and I'm sure that I am not alone.
</em><br />

<br />
Yeah, but what can you do?  It's HIS server, and if he wants to clear US
<br />
off it, there's nothin' WE can rightfully do to STOP him.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;     In closing, I will be sure to tell others about the actions of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ratman, sysop of rat.org, throughout my various peer groups of furries,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;cyberpunks, and Wired devotees; and also see to it that a new list is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;createdon a different server to serve those of us still devoted to the Blue
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Guy; with a more lenient sysadmin and fairer policies toward the fanfic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;writer.  Mark my words, fellow Freedom Fighters, I shall not rest until we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;have a new list again.  I refuse to allow such a hard-core group fall apart
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;at the seams due to the actions of one misguided individual.
</em><br />

<br />
I'D start up a list, only that can't be done on Prodigy (YET...they might
<br />
soon; as of yesterday they started reworking the whole service).  Of
<br />
course, that might prove a TEENSE maddening for some of you out there, as
<br />
my policies are the total OPPOSITE of Rat's -- hideously liberal rather
<br />
than hideously conservative -- and I'd probably let people post whatever
<br />
they wanted, regardless of Sonic content.
<br />

<br />
In any case, what Rat's doing seems a bit outta line, but we haven't much
<br />
right to be angry, as this IS, after all, HIS turf that he's donating us.
<br />
I'd do differently in his position, but I've little room to talk as I'm not
<br />
there.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;&lt;
</em><br />

<br />
Somebody's got to do it!
