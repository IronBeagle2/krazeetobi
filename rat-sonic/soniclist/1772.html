As you'll see at the end of this, I have (had? :^)) his permission to 
<br />
forward this; I've been sitting on it for 11 months now, and decided I 
<br />
agree with it so much, there wasn't any point in replying :^)  Maybe the 
<br />
rest of you will have some comments, or will just enjoy his nice summary of 
<br />
what could still be done with Sonic &amp; Co. (hints for Archie Comics?)
<br />

<br />
I'll let somebody else post it to a.f.sh if they feel it's worth doing so;
<br />
I suspect hardly anybody reads it that _isn't_ on the list already...
<br />
(except the people I CCed it to :^))

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I've not been watching StH for long.  That episode looked so much like a

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;series finale that I was thinking, &quot;Oh, great.  I must've jinxed another 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;show.&quot;  Only two minor details hint otherwise, and even point the

<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;direction the story will take next.  If my assessment holds up, it's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;going to be like Version 2.0.  But there are a few questions that episode 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;raised in my mind.
</em><br />

<br />
[RDB note: I don't remember who the above e-mail was from; the quote below 
<br />
is mine]
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'll let Dan Drazen and/or Eric Pearson comment on this, since they've 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been following this season _and_ saw this episode.  However, the e-mail 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; they sent me indicated that it was more of a season-ender than a series 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; finale...
</em><br />

<br />
Speaking for Dan Drazen...heck, speaking AS Dan Drazen...I have to
<br />
declare a 
<br />

<br />
SPOILER ALERT!
<br />

<br />
[deleted by RDB - everybody's seen it by now :^)]
<br />

<br />
News flash: it's been Version 2.0 this whole season.  Last season the
<br />
shows were few, repeated *ad nauseum* and a little inconsistent IMHO.
<br />
This season's writing has been more on track; threads that were started
<br />
actually managed to come together as the season went on.  Don't know if
<br />
Hurst was a writer for the first season, but his style seems to be
<br />
coming through.  I could never have predicted (after his one-shot
<br />
appearance last season) that Uncle Chuck would become a major player,
<br />
though there have been some weak spots: Rosie was &quot;introduced&quot; in the
<br />
last scene of &quot;Blast to the Past, part 2&quot; but has not been seen since.
<br />
Too bad; she would make a good *eminence grise* for the kids in
<br />
Knothole, and take some of the burden of supporting female character off
<br />
Bunnie's shoulders.  She represents a wasted opportunity.  Dulcy made me
<br />
cringe when she was introduced but she's grown (slightly) into the role.
<br />
And aside from one burst of intelligent behavior in &quot;Spyhog&quot; [saving
<br />
Sally by grabbing her belt], Antoine continues to be stuck in the
<br />
buffoon role.
<br />

<br />
The television business being what it is, it appears that StH's option
<br />
for next season hadn't been picked up when the final ep for THIS season
<br />
was in production.  So there had to be a &quot;resolution&quot; but one that could
<br />
be undone should the show get another thumbs-up from ABC.  Thus, as near
<br />
as I can tell, the ambiguous demise of both the Doomsday project [don't
<br />
ask me *how* it was accomplished exactly] and Robotnik, who could always
<br />
come back next season if Snively doesn't work out as a villain.
<br />

<br />
Which brings me to characterizations.  Though fairly well-defined during
<br />
the first season, they're becoming more fully established this time
<br />
around.  That's always a help from a writer's standpoint.  Robotnik in
<br />
particular has been evil in a way that makes Naugus [the wizard trapped
<br />
in the Void] seem merely spiteful.  Snively couldn't hope to be that
<br />
kind of villain; based on his lines at the end of the &quot;Doomsday&quot; ep, all
<br />
I can count on from the little twerp is megalomania and overacting.
<br />

<br />
But even assuming Robotnik's &quot;demise&quot; there's enough to do with the
<br />
show's basic premise:
<br />

<br />
*  Snively could carry on Robotnik's vendetta against the &quot;rodent.&quot;
<br />

<br />
*  Bunnie and Uncle Chuck still have to be deroboticized.
<br />

<br />
*  Sally has to be reunited with her father, stuck in the Void with
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naugus.
<br />

<br />
*  Mobius has to be cleansed of Robotnik's influence.
<br />

<br />
These are the major plot points; the identity of Snively's &quot;companion&quot;
<br />
is the cliffhanger tease to close this season, if indeed that was the
<br />
last ep of the current season.  Other unanswered questions:
<br />

<br />
* What effect(s) of Sally's exposure to the Deep Power Stones will
<br />
remain?  I found myself wondering: &quot;I wonder if she's going to spin off
<br />
into her own video game now?&quot;  Will the power rings have the same effect
<br />
on her as they do on Sonic?
<br />

<br />
* Speaking of whom, what will happen to their relationship?  Especially
<br />
in light of their spit-swappage at the end of the ep.  We're not just
<br />
talking cameraderia here!
<br />

<br />
In short (which admittedly this post hasn't been), there's work enough
<br />
for the writers should the series be picked up for another season.
<br />
Every fan probably has their own wish list for the series, so here's
<br />
mine:
<br />

<br />
1. BRING BACK ROBOTNIK
<br />
No other villain could reach his level of credible evil.  Snively was
<br />
born to play second fiddle, and Naugus wasn't that well-developed as a
<br />
villain when he had his shot.
<br />

<br />
2. STRAIGHTEN OUT ANTOINE OR LOSE HIM
<br />
I've said it before and I'll say it again: it isn't &quot;character
<br />
development&quot; when an already-annoying character becomes REALLY annoying!
<br />
He's capable of some intelligent behavior, and the cheap laughs he's
<br />
getting from his role don't make it.
<br />

<br />
3. DO SOMETHING WITH ROSIE
<br />
Lots of potential here...I mean, even the comic writers recognize a
<br />
workable character when they see one (cf. &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot;).  Having
<br />
her as a mother-figure in Knothole wouldn't be such a bad thing, and
<br />
it's possible that she and Uncle Chuck could strike up a relationship of
<br />
some sort.
<br />

<br />
4. FILL IN THE BLANKS
<br />
There are still a lot of unanswered questions about some of the
<br />
characters' backgrounds, any one of which would make a decent premise for
<br />
an ep or two:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Was Sonic an orphan when Robotnik took over, being raised by Uncle
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck, or were his parents roboticized?
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What happened to Sally's mother, the Queen?  Is there an unknown
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;sibling who might oppose her as would-be leader of the Freedom
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Fighters coalition? [The advantage here is a conflict point quite
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;apart from an alliance with Robotnik].
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Will it ever be established exactly how Bunnie got partially
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;roboticized?  There seems to be a difference of opinion between Sonic
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;#3 (I believe) and Mark Teitelbaum's &quot;Robotnik's Revenge&quot; book, and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Blast to the Past&quot; almost answered that question.
<br />

<br />
That's enough for now, I think.
<br />
