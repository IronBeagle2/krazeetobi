<br />
Trials of time...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five-hundred million years later, the automatic probe remained
<br />
as the only surviving evidence that the Cassandrans ever
<br />
existed.  Ironically, the very act of the probe (however
<br />
accidental) saving itself from doom destroyed an entire race. 
<br />
If the probe had even a vestige of emotion for what its act had
<br />
done, it might consider itself lucky.  In a span of time that
<br />
organic lifeforms have great difficulty in comprehending, the
<br />
probe had left its home system and arrived at another place, far
<br />
from the planet of lifeforms that wished to destroy it and its
<br />
lethal cargo.  The probe had, in its own way, accomplished a
<br />
great deal, even if only for the sake of survival.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, survival didn't come without a cost.  Over time, major
<br />
systems that insured the proper operation and integrity of the
<br />
probe were disabled by decay or damage from the primal span of
<br />
space.  After about two years in warp space, the probe's
<br />
navigational shield generator lost the power connection to the
<br />
shield array.  What started at that point (and continued through
<br />
the operational lifespan of the probe) was an incessant barrage
<br />
orchestrated on the probe by the universe.  The once pristine
<br />
metaliceramic case became pitted by the bombardment of hydrogen
<br />
ions, dust, and other interstellar material.  The probe's
<br />
computer decreased the probe's velocity to sublight (.05 c), but
<br />
the pelting continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The probe suffered other attacks besides dust.  About 250
<br />
million years into its journey to nowhere in particular, the
<br />
probe came a little too close to a supernova.  The shockwave
<br />
didn't rupture the hull, but it did commit severe damage to the
<br />
aft sensor array.  The probe engaged warp drive to escape from
<br />
the anticipated carnage that would ensue, but not without
<br />
becoming partially blind first.  Unknown to the probe, engaging
<br />
warp drive at this point would cause more damage than the
<br />
supernova itself would.  For the probe was still in the
<br />
proximity of the leading energy wave, and a warp engagement here
<br />
under any circumstances was hazardous.  The lead energy wave
<br />
intensified over the warp nacelles, to the point of rupturing
<br />
the field control inductors.  Plasma from the damaged nacelles
<br />
funneled back toward the matter/antimatter reactant core, then
<br />
back to the nacelles.  Energy cycled back and forth through the
<br />
plasma/energy transfer system.  The result:  an short-lived
<br />
isostatic energy state.  The probe shot away from the exploding
<br />
star with a newfound speed, staying in warp space for about two
<br />
days.  Resulting damage:  loss of maneuvering thrusters,
<br />
moderate damage to the computer core, and warp power conduit
<br />
coolant loss to space.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the probe's computers managed to regain control of the
<br />
probe, the warp core and all associated hardware were jettisoned
<br />
to prevent any unexpected warp engagement, leaving the probe
<br />
with an ion drive as its sole means of propulsion and power. 
<br />
The probe was safe, but not for very long.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five million years ago, the probe lost its forward sensor array
<br />
and the ion drive.  It drifted through space, blind and
<br />
powerless.  The probe became the playtoy of gravitational forces
<br />
that eventually aimed it toward an unassuming star system in an
<br />
unknown region of space.  The probe entered the system, being
<br />
tossed about repeatedly by the planets.  The probe apparently
<br />
thought that it should take out its frustrations on the unseen
<br />
offenders.  On the next gravitational pull, the probe twisted so
<br />
that it would be parallel to the enemy.  The probe fell straight
<br />
into the gravitational field, but this would be the last one to
<br />
torment it.
<br />

<br />
Present day, 0600 hours at Robotropolis...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik was on his command chair, facing away from the main
<br />
video/data display system in the Command &amp; Control Center.  He
<br />
scanned over the data displayed on a data screen on an armrest
<br />
of his chair.  It was data of a sort he wasn't particularly fond
<br />
of.  Apparently Sonic had managed to narrowly escape yet again
<br />
from a well-laid trap, and Robotnik found out why.  SWATBot
<br />
reinforcements were not of sufficient amount in Sector 21B,
<br />
probably due to a misallocation in the SWATBot distribution. 
<br />
What angered Robotnik even more was the fact that Sector 21B was
<br />
(emphasis on was) the area where the Advanced Technology R&amp;D
<br />
Laboratory had been.  The facility had been the mainstay of
<br />
Robotnik's war against the Mobius Freedom Fighters, churning out
<br />
more powerful laser emitters and generators, more efficient
<br />
engines for the Hover Units, new chemicals, and other methods of
<br />
dealing with the troublesome upstarts.  Now that facility was no
<br />
more, and Robotnik felt a little more vulnerable to whatever
<br />
cruel desires that the Freedom Fighters had.  Feeling vulnerable
<br />
wasn't an appropriate mindset for the Conqueror of Mobius.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He drove that point home by thrusting his roboticised arm down
<br />
on the data display, hard.  Unfortunately, the device wasn't
<br />
constructed to withstand such treatment.  The screen shattered,
<br />
expelling electronic circuitry all over the floor.  Amazed for
<br />
an instant, the irony of the situation revealed itself to
<br />
Robotnik.  He didn't need Sonic and his subordinates to destroy
<br />
what technology he and Snively were able to create and utilize. 
<br />
He could destroy it all himself, and do a much better job of it
<br />
as well.  What was merely an embarrassing emotional outburst,
<br />
even if only to himself, only made the situation worse.  There
<br />
was one less useful video display in the room, testimony to the
<br />
futility of both the situation and the animalistic response.  He
<br />
sat in his command chair with a scowl that even he didn't know
<br />
he make until now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik wasn't the only person present to hear the cacophony
<br />
of hardware stressed beyond its designed physical limits. 
<br />
Snively was monitoring the power outputs from the main
<br />
hydroelectric plants when Robotnik temporarily lost his normally
<br />
calm, dark composure.  Snively stiffened with primal fear, as if
<br />
there would be another blow struck in the near future, meant for
<br />
him.  Slowly regaining his courage, Snively redirected his eyes
<br />
from the main command computer to his natural eye level, and
<br />
slowly rotated his body around to a point where he could see the
<br />
back of Robotnik's command chair.  Sweeping his eyes over the
<br />
floor around the chair, he noticed the end product of Robotnik's
<br />
brief display of emotional chaos.  Another small vidscreen
<br />
recycled, and for the fifth time this week.  If the Hedgehog
<br />
retained his record of successful attacks on them, pretty soon
<br />
Robotnik would start ripping Robotropolis apart in anger,
<br />
transistor by transistor, and wire by wire.  Snively didn't know
<br />
whether to speak at this point or not, and then decided it
<br />
wouldn't make a difference anyway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik amazed himself for the third time that day when his
<br />
scowl became even sharper by the sound of Snively's voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir?&quot;  Snively ventured forth onto unknown territory, but his
<br />
curiosity had gotten the better of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next was totally unexpected.  Robotnik pressed a
<br />
key on the left chair command panel to rotate the chair around
<br />
to face Snively.  He slowly rose out of the chair, paced over to
<br />
Snively's position, and grabbed him by the collar.  Robotnik
<br />
gave Snively a very hard, irritated stare about six inches from
<br />
his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, Mr. Snively?&quot;  Robotnik gave him a rather dangerous
<br />
invitation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively could only reply with a nervous laugh and started
<br />
fingering his shirt collar.  Robotnik responded by darkening his
<br />
stare even further, and said with the model of an impatient
<br />
ruler, &quot;Well, Snively?&quot;  He nearly shrieked on that statement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any courage that Snively ever had vanished at that point.  He
<br />
could only give Robotnik a stare, the pathetic stare similar to
<br />
a person that was about to be roboticised.  Robotnik gave
<br />
Snively a cringe of dismissal, drew the arm that he was holding
<br />
Snively with back, and threw him at the wall.  The resounding
<br />
impact of flesh on metal, plus seeing Snively knocked out cold,
<br />
calmed Robotnik down a degree.  A very small degree.  It seemed
<br />
that nothing would be accomplished today at this rate.  The loss
<br />
of the R&amp;D facility, plus the success of Sonic for bypassing
<br />
security via a gap that never should have existed around a very
<br />
sensitive military area, were not encouraging.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation was about to change.  Robotnik heard the sound of
<br />
three robots walking in cadence, two metallic, one not.  The
<br />
three robots walked into the C&amp;C with what sounded almost like a
<br />
determined candor.  The two SWATBots stopped, and moved into
<br />
their guard positions by the doorway.  The other robot, actually
<br />
an android, continued to step forward.  The android then scanned
<br />
over the room with all the sensors available to it, looking over
<br />
the decimated vidscreen and Snively lying on the floor in a
<br />
rather uncomfortable position.  Taking stock of the situation,
<br />
it decided to keep a respectable distance from Robotnik.  You
<br />
never know when you might be the next advanced artificial
<br />
construct to visit Dr. Robotnik, but never go out again in
<br />
functional condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing his pride and joy, Cmdr. Packbell, Robotnik's anger
<br />
simmered down to nothing nearly immediately.  &quot;Yes, Packbell,&quot;
<br />
said Robotnik in a voice that would redeem a criminal, &quot;what
<br />
news do you have to report?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir,&quot; said Packbell in a calm monotone, to prevent the former
<br />
anger from erupting on him, &quot;I have news of a spacecraft that
<br />
fell from space at about 0400 hours.  I was on patrol with the
<br />
Delta SWAT Team looking for the Wolf Pack Freedom Fighters
<br />
during that time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Are you certain that it was from space, and not just one of
<br />
our spy satellites?&quot; Robotnik questioned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, sir.  The mass, volume, and general configuration do not
<br />
match any of our surveillance or other equipment.  It also does
<br />
not match anything that we know that Knothole or any other
<br />
Freedom Fighter group has.  It is more than likely from another
<br />
planet.&quot;  Packbell tried to parse the information out as
<br />
completely as possible, still not completely convinced that
<br />
Robotnik was in a benign mood.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's interest was piqued.  &quot;Where is this spacecraft now?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;About 200.7 kilometers south of here, located in Granite
<br />
Wastes of the Great Unknown, sir.  We have also found something
<br />
in it that you might find particularly interesting.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that so?  Show me the reconnaissance tapes.&quot;  Robotnik was
<br />
very interested now.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell strolled over to the main computer, and pressed the
<br />
appropriate controls to call up the requested video data.  A
<br />
second later, a still-graphic appeared with the piece of
<br />
equipment that Packbell anticipated might be of importance to
<br />
Robotnik.  Robotnik's eyes went wide when he looked over the
<br />
device.  From the looks of it, it could very well turn the tide
<br />
of the war toward Robotnik's favor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there was any doubt in Packbell's mind that Robotnik's day
<br />
was about to be a good one, all of it disappeared.  &quot;Very well,&quot;
<br />
Robotnik said, all interest still focused on the image, &quot;inform
<br />
the surveillance team that I want that weapon back here
<br />
immediately, as well as any information they can find about its
<br />
operation.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A slight pause from Packbell.  Nearly insignificant, but enough
<br />
to speak of trouble.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Packbell?  Are there any problems with those orders?&quot; 
<br />
Robotnik's anger slowly reemerged, taking a new target in its
<br />
sights.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Packbell's turn to begin worrying about his future
<br />
welfare.  One look at Snively reconfirmed just how far Robotnik
<br />
would tolerate such insubordination.  Packbell searched through
<br />
his positronic matrix to find any flaws that might have caused
<br />
him to withhold the information, possibly a connection that may
<br />
have decayed over time due to lack of use.  A small feeling of
<br />
horror built up in Packbell, after completing a full diagnostic,
<br />
and finding nothing.  One of the many other things to attribute
<br />
to his reaction by what limited emotional level he had;  not by
<br />
an electronic failure.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He managed to regain his composure in time to save his
<br />
circuitry from the robot recycler.  &quot;Yes, sir.  There is a
<br />
matter of difficulty involved in executing those commands.  In
<br />
order to return the weapon and the required operational data to
<br />
Robotropolis, there is a matter of being able to do the
<br />
requested operations in the first place.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How is that so?&quot;  Robotnik's dark stare and gravely voice
<br />
slowly intensified, a sign that Packbell had not yet been
<br />
reprieved from uncertain physical damage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The craft has many occurrences of hieroglyphics, for lack of a
<br />
better term, on the computers and the weapon's protective
<br />
housing.  I projected that they would have the required
<br />
information as to how the weapon's housing would be opened, and
<br />
the same may be true for the data download procedure.&quot;  A pause,
<br />
as if to consider what else needed to be said, and then he
<br />
continued.  &quot;I instructed the SWATBots to attempt a brute-force
<br />
method of obtaining both;  however, the results were not
<br />
successful.  In short, a language translator is required to aid
<br />
in opening the protective housing and downloading the data.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik calmed down, but not completely.  A hint of a
<br />
dangerous red glow from Robotnik's eyes still glared in
<br />
Packbell's face.  &quot;Do you mean to tell me that you don't have
<br />
the facilities to get a translation?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, Dr. Robotnik.  I have no such program available to me, and
<br />
I could not download it from any data site from our position. 
<br />
That is why I returned without the weapon and the data.  I
<br />
required something or someone that could alleviate the problem
<br />
of translation.&quot;  Packbell managed to retain his composure, even
<br />
though he knew that he was standing near what could very well
<br />
turn into a mental version of an unstable nuclear reactor slowly
<br />
building toward meltdown condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Surprisingly, Robotnik disengaged his stare, thought over the
<br />
change in the situation, and started his scheming mode.  He
<br />
paced the floor for a few minutes, Packbell remained in his
<br />
position by the main computer.  &quot;Very well, then,&quot; Robotnik
<br />
finally said.  &quot;Inform the service crews that I want my personal
<br />
Hover Unit ready in the next five minutes.  You and I will join
<br />
the reconnaissance group.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if suddenly remembering something, Packbell stuttered, &quot;What
<br />
about......&quot;  He pointed in Snively's general direction. 
<br />
Snively, for the moment, was still on vacation.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Never mind him.  He can catch up with us after he wakes up. 
<br />
Now, Packbell my boy, let's see about that weapon.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Five minutes later, Robotnik and Packbell were cruising toward
<br />
the eastern outpost for the linguistics program archive, certain
<br />
that Snively would not take part in the mission anytime soon. 
<br />
However, there was someone unnoticed in the air ducts that saw
<br />
and missed nothing.  Charles Hedgehog ran back down the air
<br />
ducts, toward the location of his covert operations base.
<br />

<br />
0620 hours, in the Great Plains...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sun was just barely above the horizon, its light creating
<br />
an array of complex and beautiful patterns of colors across the
<br />
sky.  To any observer, it would be so distracting that they
<br />
would forget that Mobius ever was at war with Robotnik, and that
<br />
their day to be alive as an organic lifeform would be their
<br />
last.  Compared to the overly-familiar background of the somber
<br />
and depressing pollution cloud that wrapped over Robotropolis
<br />
like a Terran boa constrictor, this scene was heaven.  The air
<br />
was pure with the smell of clean air;  not the choking, lethal
<br />
atmosphere that Robotnik called his home.  Yes, a spectator
<br />
would almost forget everything that took place in the past
<br />
eleven years.  Almost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From this particular vantage point, located somewhere in the
<br />
Great Plains, the observer could see Robotropolis' microcosm, a
<br />
reminder of reality.  The atmosphere had a reality of its own: 
<br />
a benign and malignant side.  There were areas where they alone
<br />
were present and the dominant form, and others where they
<br />
intermixed, as if even Mobius' biosphere was fighting a war of
<br />
it's own to keep the evil clouds at bay.  It wasn't entirely
<br />
clear as to what side had the advantage and would eventually
<br />
become victorious, so it seemed to be a stalemate.  So far.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The significance of the atmospheric battle that had been going
<br />
on for about eleven years had not been lost on Princess Sally. 
<br />
She had trouble sleeping the past night, due to the work
<br />
involved with being the first defense front against Robotnik. 
<br />
So she decided to suspend the war, at least in her mind, for a
<br />
little while so she could relax.  Belatedly realizing the error
<br />
in choosing this location to view the sunrise only made her mood
<br />
worse.  For that battle between the two areas of Mobius'
<br />
biosphere had a symbolic connection to what the current
<br />
situation with the war against Robotnik was.  There was no win
<br />
or lose;  there was only an isostatic balance between the
<br />
offensive acts of the armies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'We give what seems to be the final blow to Robotnik's plans,
<br />
and he's able to turn around and do the same to us!' Sally
<br />
screamed with near-despair in her mind.  'No matter what we do,
<br />
both sides end up equal.  Only while Robotnik loses SWATBots, we
<br />
lose good-hearted people!'  Sally considered the situation,
<br />
almost thought it futile.  'No!  I-we can't let that come
<br />
between us and the safety of Mobius, as well as our families. 
<br />
We will stop Robotnik some day in the future!'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point, Sally started crying.  The tears and the intent,
<br />
however, were of brazen determination;  not sadness.  Amazing
<br />
how the war had progressed on for so long, and yet people still
<br />
had the tenacity to face it with the same drive they had so many
<br />
years ago.  One point in the Freedom Fighters' favor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked up at the sky again, and saw an imaginary blue
<br />
speck.  She rubbed her eyes to remove it from her field of
<br />
vision.  The speck remained visible, and it was moving at a high
<br />
velocity toward the east.  Fearing the worst, Sally reached into
<br />
her backpack and pulled out an IR/binocular unit.  She saw that
<br />
her suspicions were correct.  It was difficult to know what
<br />
operation was underway, but it's generally a sign of trouble for
<br />
the Freedom Fighters when Robotnik is personally going to an
<br />
area to inspect the process of his schemes.  She turned to run
<br />
back to Knothole.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she was near the Great Plains/Great Forest border, she
<br />
heard the trilling hoot of the messenger bird.  It was high
<br />
above, and apparently did not see her.  Sally cupped a fist
<br />
around her mouth and called to the bird.  He responded by
<br />
swooping down, and executing an expertly-placed landing on
<br />
Sally's outstretched arm.  She the top off the cylindrical
<br />
container and pulled out a paper with a message inscribed on it.
<br />
&nbsp;It read:
<br />

<br />
NEW SITUATION DEVELOPING:
<br />

<br />
ROBOTNIK HAS THE LOCATION OF AN ALIEN PROBE THAT HAS
<br />
CRASH-LANDED IN THE GREAT UNKNOWN.  CONTAINS WEAPON OF UNKNOWN
<br />
TYPE.  SEND A TEAM TO THESE COORDINATES TO INVESTIGATE:
<br />

<br />
20N 30W
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Included with the message was a small data disk.  She took a
<br />
quick look over the video data, and considered the potential of
<br />
what this craft had to offer.  Needless to say, it did not bode
<br />
well.  Sally quickened her pace to twice as fast as before,
<br />
given the severity of the events that might unfold if actions
<br />
were not taken to prevent whatever Robotnik had in mind.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immediately after returning to Knothole, Sally assembled a
<br />
small investigatory team for the mission at her hut.  It
<br />
consisted of:  Sonic as field commander, Dulcy as transporter,
<br />
and herself as computer expert.  Sally had called Bookshire in
<br />
to assist with making modifications to Nicole, in the hopes that
<br />
Nicole would be able to translate the alien language seen on
<br />
many of the craft's computers and other hardware.  This turned
<br />
into an extensive technical conversation that Sonic was not
<br />
privy to the finer details of.  This went on for about 20
<br />
minutes, and then he couldn't withstand the technical jargon
<br />
that seemed to permeate the hut.  He made his level of technical
<br />
knowledge abundantly clear to the rest of the investigatory
<br />
party.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now wait a Sonic Second!&quot; the hedgehog interrupted, a
<br />
testimony to frustration.  &quot;If you do what, you'll be able to do
<br />
who?!  What on Mobius is that?!&quot;  He threw his arms up in a
<br />
gesture of surrender.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was about to give Sonic a message of her own on no
<br />
uncertain terms in frustration herself, but Bookshire saved them
<br />
both from engaging in a battle of wits which there would be no
<br />
definable successor.  Speaking very patiently to Sonic, while
<br />
giving Sally a look that convinced her to refrain from dictating
<br />
any ascorbic comments, he said, &quot;What we're trying to do is
<br />
this, Sonic,&quot;  A pause, and then he continued.  &quot;If we can
<br />
interconnect Nicole's language system, that is, the knowledge of
<br />
the languages that she already can translate, to the new dynamic
<br />
predictive logic circuit that I installed, we might have a
<br />
better chance of having Nicole translating the alien's language.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic gave Bookshire a look that explained that he wasn't
<br />
exactly impressed, but he got the message.  &quot;Well, OK,&quot; he
<br />
finally said.  &quot;But what about all that other stuff that you
<br />
were saying about putting in Nicole?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire spoke again as the emotional mediator.  &quot;Those other
<br />
circuits are for her sensor array.  There's no telling what
<br />
Robotnik found out there, and I had a few new circuits I wanted
<br />
to test out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently satisfied by the explanations, Sonic walked over to
<br />
a chair and sat down with his hands on his forehead, muttering
<br />
to himself in a voice so low that noone could comprehend what
<br />
was happening in his unique hedgehog mind.  Dulcy looked on the
<br />
entire confrontation of techspeak versus the not-so-inclined
<br />
hedgehog with a small degree of amusement.  Of course, she had
<br />
about as much understanding of the situation as Sonic, but she
<br />
was content to wait and try to sort out everything when she
<br />
could get a better understanding of technology in general. 
<br />
Right now, there was no hope of getting an introductory course
<br />
in computer science, so she, like Sonic, had to consign herself
<br />
to being lost in the technobabble.  The only distinction was
<br />
that Dulcy had considerably more patience, something that made a
<br />
difference, even if it was only Sally's nerves that were at
<br />
stake.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The technical conversation resumed, and continued for about
<br />
five minutes.  Satisfied with the upgrades to Nicole, Sally
<br />
secured Nicole's case together.  &quot;OK team&quot;, she said, observing
<br />
her comrades, &quot;this is what we need to do.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ensued after that point was another technical
<br />
conversation, but it was one of tactical nature, something that
<br />
Sonic readily understood without question.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After all the talk and preparation, the investigation force was
<br />
ready to depart for the crash site at about 0900 hours. 
<br />
Bookshire stood by Dulcy, explaining to Sally one final time how
<br />
to operate the new hardware installed in Nicole.  Sonic, as
<br />
usual, looked around with the air of someone lost in a very
<br />
boring conversation;  Dulcy just grinned, equally clueless but
<br />
not inclined to make the matter a public issue.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now remember, Sally,&quot; Bookshire was admonishing, &quot;try to
<br />
prevent any excessive motion with Nicole.  It would skew the
<br />
alignment on the circuits.  But if anything does happen, press
<br />
this key to reset the circuits.  It should reinitialize them and
<br />
correct the problem.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right, Bookshire,&quot; said Sally.  &quot;Thanks for helping me
<br />
with the upgrades.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No problem at all, Sally.  Anything to help out a friend in
<br />
need of technical assistance.  Ever since Rotor caught that flu,
<br />
I've been filling in for him in the past few days.&quot;  He paused
<br />
to think, and then began speaking in a more severe tone.  &quot;But
<br />
you kids have something more important to to than listen me babble off.
<br />
Get going to that crash site!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire then paced away as fast as his injured leg would
<br />
permit.  The three friends watched him in mutual amazement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly remembering what task they had prepared for, Sally
<br />
spoke for the three of them.  &quot;He's right, you know.  Dulcy, you
<br />
heard the man.  Let's go!&quot; Sally said decisively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Crack-the-whip time, Sally.  Hang on!&quot; Dulcy warned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a flutter of wings against air, a feeling of
<br />
levitation, and suddenly, a strong propulsive force directed
<br />
upward as Dulcy snapped her tail.  A few seconds later, they
<br />
were one with the midmorning sky, heading toward uncertain
<br />
danger.
