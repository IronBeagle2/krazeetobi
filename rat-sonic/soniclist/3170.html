<br />
Ken,
<br />

<br />
As usual, thanks for your courteous reply.  Just a couple points:
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I would compare working on SONIC to be almost as complex as working on STAR
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TREK, which I have done for both DC Comics and Malibu. When working on any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; TREK-related series, the primary guideline was anything filmed was considered
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;official&quot; TREK history. It's only now that some novels or certain projects
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; contain &quot;official&quot; information considered part of TREK lore. Even so, nothing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; printed in comics is deemed official. In fact, Roddenberry supposedly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; disavowed the animation series he spearheaded back in the early '70's, even
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though it features stories by such TREK luminaries as D.C. Fontana, David
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Gerrold and Walter Koenig. Not to mention the voices of the ORIGINAL CAST!!!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As far as I'm aware, even though Gene's ashes are scattered out in space,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Paramount still doesn't acknowledge the animated series.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
I didn't know you'd done any &quot;Trek&quot; work -- cool!  I second the motion
<br />
concerning the animated series, if only because the Filmation animation
<br />
was so shoddy and flat no amount of classy writing could have saved it.
<br />

<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Even Mike and I get it wrong ourselves. For instance, in A SENSE OF HISTORY
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Part One, we showed a hedgehog pounding a sign into the ground with his
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; family standing nearby. We originally had on the sign &quot;Future Site of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knothole Village&quot;, as we thought it would be a neat bit to state that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Knothole Village stands where the Floating Island once existed. However, when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we wrote that, Mike Gallagher was only beginning to write the TAILS
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mini-series. After he established the world of Downunda and Knuckles'
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grandfather Athair, it was decided it made more sense since echidnas come
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; from Austrailia to have the Floating Island originate from Downunda. Due to a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; rush of deadlines at this time, I wasn't even made aware of this until I saw
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the printed story.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
Yeah, I was wondering about that business with the sign myself.  Since
<br />
it couldn't be read in the final art I was left to wonder what kind of
<br />
gag was involved.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; When Mike and I started working on the series, we were submitting stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; based on what Mike Gallagher was doing, as he was the primary writer at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time. With each passing story, we started getting subversive and began
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; emphasizing more of the adventure aspects and less of the bad puns, using
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; humor when called for, and not doing a gag at the expense of the story. If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; you go back and reread those early issues, you'll see how we gradually began
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to steer the book in the direction we wanted rather than maintaining the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; status quo. However, we could not have done this had the folks at SEGA not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; been receptive to what we were trying to do.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
I've made no secret about the fact that I've considered this to be an
<br />
improvement.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Battle-hardened&quot; describes an attitude, not tactics. If Sonic and Sally and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; company had been fighting for over ten years with Robotnik, they'd have the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; attitude and look reminiscent of soldiers fighting in the trenches during
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; World War II. And we'd love to do that, but we can't because of our young
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; audience. As it is, in order to get anything with an edge through, we use
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Disney as our guideline, as in: If Disney can do it in their cartoons, why
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; can't we in our comics.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
Actually, you and Mike have already opened the door for some
<br />
&quot;battle-hardened&quot; Mobians: the cyborg freedom fighters alluded to at the
<br />
beginning of &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot; (#19).  This occurred to me
<br />
one day when &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; by Talking Heads came on the radio
<br />
and I found myself wondering if the Knothole gang had ever cranked it up
<br />
to that level of intensity.  I just couldn't picture it; the borg freedom
<br />
fighters, on the other hand....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for Sonic's history, Mike and I have a rough timeline and what stories
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; we'd like to document about that timeline. For instance, if you read SONIC
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; #36, we mention Robotnik's mentor Kodos, who is going to feature very
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; prominently in the series after issue #50. In #17, we showed Robotnik taking
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; over Mobotropolis, and portray Julayla getting Sonic and Sally to safety.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Although we didn't have the room, Rosie was there as well, making sure that
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Tails was escorted safely out of the war zone. Antoine and Rotor were at the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; front lines, and beat a retreat to fight another day. Tails' parents were
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; among those roboticized, and we have yet to decide how or if we'll
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; incorporate them into the series. Y'see, we can answer your questions
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; regarding continuity, but this is the Archie version APPROVED by SEGA.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
I'll probably get my chance to check out #36 this week: the distributor
<br />
in this corner of Michigan doesn't drop off new issues until the first
<br />
Thursday of the month.  Am looking forward to the developments you
<br />
described.  And funny you should mention #17: I ordered that as a back
<br />
issue a while back in order to have the complete &quot;Sally's Crusade.&quot;
<br />
Your description of what might have been included in the story had you
<br />
not confronted space limitations makes me wonder whether or not Archie
<br />
would issue a &quot;director's cut&quot; of a story such as &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; in a
<br />
Digest format.  I know that that's probably asking too much, that it's
<br />
more economical to do a straight reprint.  Still, it sounds like a lot
<br />
of good stuff was left on the cutting room floor, as it were.
<br />

<br />
Thanks again for the reply.
<br />

<br />
Dan
<br />

<br />
