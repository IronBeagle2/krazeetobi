&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
<br />
<br />[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />
<br />Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
<br />
original four-part Sonic miniseries:
<br />
<br />Issue 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't Cry For Me, Mobius&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
<br />
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
<br />
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
<br />
referred to as &quot;Boomer.&quot;)  Antoine then announces that there is a
<br />
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
<br />
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
<br />
ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Royal Family of Mobius&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and
<br />
Uncle Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys
<br />
the stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets
<br />
Sally (with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the
<br />
rest of the freedom fighters in Knothole.
<br />
<br />Issue 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Run, Sally, Run&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
<br />
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
<br />
and almost throws her into the &quot;Robo-machine.&quot;  Sonic rescues
<br />
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
<br />
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
<br />
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.
<br />
<br />Issue 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Crowning Achievement&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally decides to wear the &quot;Crown of the Acorn Kings&quot; which
<br />
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
<br />
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
<br />
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
<br />
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
<br />
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.
<br />
<br /><br />Issue 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Flashback&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
<br />
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
<br />
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
<br />
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
<br />
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Ask Spy&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
<br />
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
<br />
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
<br />
destroys the factory.
<br />
<br /><br />And a tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
<br />
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:
<br />
<br />#1  [Aug 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
<br />
called &quot;Krudzu&quot; and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
<br />
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
<br />
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
<br />
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
<br />
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You Bet My Life!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher &amp; Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
<br />
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
<br />
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
<br />
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
<br />
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
<br />
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
<br />
casino was rebuilt for &quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot; (#16); the
<br />
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
<br />
the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
<br />
called &quot;Boomer&quot; at this time.  DJD]
<br />
<br />#2  [Sep 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Triple Trouble&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
<br />
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
<br />
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
<br />
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
<br />
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vertigo A Go Go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
<br />
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All The Mail's About Tails&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who express their
<br />
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
<br />
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
<br />
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
<br />
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
<br />
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
<br />
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
<br />
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
<br />
something dealing with evolution.
<br />
<br />#3  [Oct 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Bomb Bugs Me&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has &quot;the
<br />
bomb.&quot;  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
<br />
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
<br />
to trick Crabmeat into giving &quot;the bomb&quot; to the freedom fighters,
<br />
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
<br />
Boomer suit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
<br />
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
<br />
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
<br />
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
<br />
they are &quot;tied up.&quot;  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
<br />
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
<br />
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
<br />
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
<br />
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
<br />
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
<br />
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
<br />
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
<br />
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
<br />
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
<br />
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
<br />
children in Blast to the Past, and so wouldn't be a stranger to
<br />
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
<br />
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
<br />
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]
<br />
<br />#4  [Nov 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Lizard of Odd!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
<br />
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
<br />
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
<br />
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
<br />
&quot;Lizard Lips&quot; belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
<br />
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
<br />
roboticizer [see above, &quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;], and cuts
<br />
Universalamander down to size.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Little Tale&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
<br />
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
<br />
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
<br />
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
<br />
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
<br />
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
<br />
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.
<br />
<br /><br />#5  [Dec 1993]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Olympic Trials and Errors&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
<br />
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik &quot;promises&quot;
<br />
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
<br />
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
<br />
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
<br />
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
<br />
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
<br />
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
<br />
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
<br />
to usiness as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture was
<br />
repeated in &quot;That's The Spirit&quot; (#20). DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chomp on This, Chump!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
<br />
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
<br />
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
<br />
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
<br />
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
<br />
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
<br />
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
<br />
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
<br />
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in &quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
<br />
Fighter&quot; (#23). DJD]
<br />
<br />#6  [Jan 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Spin Doctor&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
<br />
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
<br />
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
<br />
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
<br />
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
<br />
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
<br />
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
<br />
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
<br />
be rescued by Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic's Christmas Carol&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
<br />
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
<br />
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
<br />
straightened out. DJD]
<br />
<br />#7  [Feb 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck's Treasure&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
<br />
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  They believe the &quot;treasure&quot; may be an invention that will
<br />
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
<br />
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
<br />
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
<br />
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
<br />
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
<br />
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
<br />
that the &quot;treasure&quot; is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
<br />
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorceress in Distress&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
<br />
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
<br />
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
<br />
to be real.  Robotnik sees the &quot;sorceress&quot; and, unaware that it's
<br />
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
<br />
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
<br />
sorceress's &quot;magic&quot; and Sally obliges, with a little help from
<br />
Sonic.
<br />
<br /><br />#8  [Mar 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bot's All, Folks!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
<br />
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
<br />
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, &quot;Botman,&quot; &quot;Wolvurkel&quot; (a
<br />
factory second sent by mistake), &quot;Spawnmower,&quot; &quot;Magbot--Freedom
<br />
Fighter Fighter,&quot; &quot;Captain Marbot&quot; and &quot;Mighty 'Bot.&quot;  [Furries
<br />
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  &quot;Wolvurkel&quot;
<br />
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
<br />
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Little Music Goes A Long Way&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
<br />
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
<br />
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
<br />
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
<br />
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
<br />
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
<br />
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
<br />
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
<br />
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
<br />
the hall.
<br />
<br /><br />#9  [Apr 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pseudo-Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
<br />
builds his ultimate eil robot, &quot;Pseudo-Sonic.&quot;  Meanwhile, Sonic
<br />
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
<br />
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
<br />
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
<br />
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
<br />
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
<br />
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
<br />
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the Point?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
<br />
upon a Mobian needl bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to give
<br />
it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
<br />
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
<br />
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
<br />
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
<br />
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
<br />
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
<br />
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
<br />
say, was behind the mechanical trees).
<br />
<br /><br />#10  [May 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Revenge of the Nerbs!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
<br />
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
<br />
&quot;Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society&quot; can apprehend them, the
<br />
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
<br />
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dewlling race.  The king
<br />
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
<br />
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
<br />
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
<br />
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
<br />
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
<br />
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
<br />
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
<br />
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
<br />
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
<br />
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Twan With The Wind&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
<br />
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
<br />
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
<br />
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
<br />
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
<br />
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.
<br />
<br /><br />#11  [Jun 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
<br />
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a &quot;short cut&quot; via the Cosmic
<br />
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
<br />
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
<br />
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
<br />
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
<br />
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
<br />
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
<br />
Sonic wakes up.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
<br />
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
<br />
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
<br />
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
<br />
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
<br />
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
<br />
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
<br />
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
<br />
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
<br />
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
<br />
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
<br />
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
<br />
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
<br />
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
<br />
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
<br />
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
<br />
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
<br />
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
<br />
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
<br />
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
<br />
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
<br />
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
<br />
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
<br />
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
<br />
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
<br />
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
<br />
Sonic recovers the Emerald.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
<br />
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
<br />
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
<br />
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
<br />
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
<br />
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
<br />
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
<br />
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
<br />
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
<br />
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
<br />
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
<br />
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
<br />
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
<br />
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rockin' The Bot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
<br />
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
<br />
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
<br />
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
<br />
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
<br />
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
<br />
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
<br />
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
<br />
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
<br />
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
<br />
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
<br />
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
<br />
crafts a giant flyswatter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
<br />
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
<br />
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
<br />
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
<br />
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
<br />
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
<br />
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
<br />
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.

<br /><br />#16  [Nov 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Summary by Erich Schulman]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Under Glass&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
<br />
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
<br />
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
<br />
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
<br />
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
<br />
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
<br />
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
<br />
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
<br />
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
<br />
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
<br />
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
<br />
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
<br />
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
<br />
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
<br />
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
<br />
spin, he lands on &quot;undersea bank heist.&quot;  Robotnik's lackey's
<br />
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
<br />
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
<br />
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
<br />
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
<br />
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
<br />
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
<br />
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
<br />
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
<br />
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!] (c.f. &quot;The Mail's About
<br />
Tails&quot; (#2); that Sonic was just a little slow rescuing Bunnie
<br />
from the roboticizer (&quot;Rabbit Deployment,&quot; #3).  On a more
<br />
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
<br />
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
<br />
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.
<br />
<br /><br /><br />#17  [Dec 1994]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
<br />
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
<br />
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
<br />
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
<br />
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
<br />
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
<br />
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
<br />
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
<br />
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While reminiscing about life as a little girl before
<br />
Robotnik's takeover, Sally sees something fall from the sky.  It
<br />
turns out to be a shiny metal orb.  To be continued.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Manak
<br />
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
<br />
plans an attack.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot; (Sally's Crusade, part 2)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
<br />
&quot;First Star....&quot;, #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
<br />
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.  They never use the D-
<br />
word, but it's an affecting story nevertheless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
<br />
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
<br />
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
<br />
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
<br />
spelled out in a &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of the story.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mirror Zone&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story and art: Pat Spaziante [debut]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as &quot;about 15.&quot;  [Note, if
<br />
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Tallest Tale&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story and art: Scott Shaw!
<br />
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
<br />
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  The return of
<br />
Shaw!.
<br />
<br />#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.
<br />
<br />#20 [Mar 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
<br />
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): &quot;Give Mobius
<br />
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;
<br />
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
<br />
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
<br />
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.
