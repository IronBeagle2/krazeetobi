<br />

<br />
Temporal Notice:  The background of the following story takes
<br />
place a few months after the failed Doomsday Project, during the
<br />
midsummer of the year 3236.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The maturity of the day was very near the hour of midnight in
<br />
Knothole's time zone.  Almost everyone of the Knothole Freedom
<br />
Fighters and their associates from the Wolf Pack and other
<br />
groups were asleep in their huts, dreaming the dreams of a
<br />
benevolent future for their planet.  Nearly all the lights were
<br />
out, to promote each individual's travel into the dream world, a
<br />
place where everyone lived an alternate life for the duration of
<br />
their time of slumber.  The borders and the interior of the
<br />
encampment that was home to members of an extended family, the
<br />
members consisting of various decent of status and other aspects
<br />
of heritage, were as silent as the vacuum of space.  Almost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one could listen and look with more intensity and
<br />
persistence, Knothole was not the perfect example of peaceful
<br />
and somber darkness.  In one particular hut, no unlit regions
<br />
existed for the blackness to take refuge.  It was a warning to
<br />
the agents of the shade that their victory would come another
<br />
day, another time in the hereafter.  Or, more than likely, it
<br />
was only Rotor and Bookshire in the development phase of yet
<br />
another late-night project in Rotor's new workshop.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside, Rotor hefted the massive glass vat from the biogenics
<br />
storage closet, a 100 kg cylinder containing twenty kg of an
<br />
intricate, carefully balanced powder holding the basic chemical
<br />
elements of life.  No DNA or other evidence of order resided in
<br />
the powder, but it was a segment of preface to a new artificial
<br />
lifeform that Rotor and Bookshire toiled to design for some
<br />
time.  He carried it cautiously over to the main computer, where
<br />
Bookshire was laboring over the theoretical designs and
<br />
composition of the endoskeletal frame.  The middle-aged raccoon
<br />
displayed signs of his steadily advancing age, with suggestions
<br />
of silver streaking through his fur.  However, when intensely
<br />
working on a project worthy of provoking his prowess, he was no
<br />
older than his teenage associate.  Younger, in fact, for he
<br />
concentrated on such projects like a child with a new playtoy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor slowly lowered the vat to a temporary resting place by
<br />
the main computer, grunting with the gradual displacement of its
<br />
mass from his powerful muscles.  After Robotnik's failed attempt
<br />
to finally bring Mobius and its inhabitants groveling to his
<br />
feet, he had more leisure time to exercise, both physically and
<br />
mentally.  A short time ago, Rotor might not have been able to
<br />
perform such an act as carrying the voluminous load the short
<br />
distance to the main computer.  Then again, the old Rotor wasn't
<br />
the walrus working on the important experiment that night.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire sensed Rotor's presence, but did not look up to
<br />
examine his comrade.  The majority of his concentration centered
<br />
on the computer display, while he softly pressed the appropriate
<br />
controls to alter the various parameters of the endoskeleton to
<br />
conform to his specifications.  The endoskeleton took the
<br />
structure of a young eleven year-old fox, belying the strength
<br />
that would normally be present in a lifeform many times its
<br />
size.  The new alloy that Rotor and Bookshire designed for the
<br />
frame was perfect:  high tensile strength, nearly invulnerable
<br />
to multiple weapons-grade laser impacts, stealthy (nearly all
<br />
forms of detection devices were blind to its presence, except
<br />
optical), and more than adequate to the task of shielding the
<br />
organic overlay (on connection to the positronic matrix, it
<br />
could expand the stealthy field of influence, retarding nearly
<br />
every sensor).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The raccoon also reviewed the positronic matrix.  It was a work
<br />
of art for something that had been conceived of in such a short
<br />
time.  Countless hours were spent on the cranial cognitive unit,
<br />
which it was more officially known as between the two partners
<br />
in cybernetics.  Part computer, part organic design, it would
<br />
allow the new lifeform to function and think.  This would
<br />
promote interaction with the other Knothole residents.  Many
<br />
sleepless nights produced the perfect programming that the new
<br />
artificial life would need:  tactics, command procedures,
<br />
physiology, and other subjects important to Freedom Fighter
<br />
commanders.  For this was to be Sonic's near-future second, if
<br />
not his replacement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whew.  That was some workout.  How's everything at your end?&quot;
<br />
the walrus asked his friend.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Retaining his focus on the computer display, Bookshire replied,
<br />
&quot;Faster than expected, Rotor.  The endoskeleton and the
<br />
positronic matrix designs are ready for freezing.  I don't think
<br />
we left anything out of the system that might be needed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great.  The sooner, the better.  Sonic's been complaining that
<br />
he didn't have any excuse to get out of Knothole these days,
<br />
with noone to go on missions with.&quot;  Rotor dictated this with an
<br />
air of finality.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In truth, Sonic had been rather wearied by the now perpetual
<br />
boredom that seemed to permeate Knothole.  However, there was
<br />
more to his mood under the surface.  He was seriously
<br />
considering an alteration to the chain of command, wanting to
<br />
have more time to devote to his other hobbies.  He tired of not
<br />
having the opportunity to make command decisions, or to risk his
<br />
life to safe another's.  He thought of taking a step down from
<br />
his command position, but had noone to offer it to.  His
<br />
relationship with his friends was also taking a precarious turn.
<br />
&nbsp;Sally had been put under increasingly higher degrees of
<br />
workload, and didn't have the time that she and Sonic used to
<br />
have for leisure in the past.  Sally wasn't the only one;  just
<br />
about everyone else had been assigned to other tasks, except
<br />
him.  He felt left out, since nothing that he could do seemed to
<br />
be available for him to concern himself with.  Ultimately, he
<br />
needed something to do, or someone he could talk to that would
<br />
understand his condition.  Otherwise, the irritated hedgehog
<br />
might die of boredom, a point that he attempted to make
<br />
abundantly clear to everyone else at Knothole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I hope that this little project of ours does,&quot; said
<br />
Bookshire with a grave tone to his voice, &quot;I can't bear to see
<br />
Sonic like that anymore.  All alone and depressed, something
<br />
must be done, and fast.  That boy's too young to waste away like
<br />
he's doing now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor nodded in silent agreement, knowing all too well what one
<br />
of his closest friends was feeling now, without a function
<br />
worthy of his attention.  The two cybernetics experts taxed
<br />
themselves further into the early hours of the next day, with no
<br />
further verbal exchange on any subject.  Working as a single
<br />
entity, they both continued on their task of creating a new
<br />
life, and possibly a new comrade for Sonic.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At 0800 hours the next morning, the sun's bright rays pierced
<br />
through holes in the foliage that protected Knothole from
<br />
detection by sensors and other silent, unseen observers.  The
<br />
solar radiation continued its confrontation until it came near a
<br />
blue teenage hedgehog, sitting on the steps to his home.  It
<br />
seemed to notice the mental condition of the hedgehog, for it
<br />
softened from a shower of fine thorns to a smoother, blanketing
<br />
shape over the hedgehog's body.  After not receiving any
<br />
response from this gesture of kindness, the rays intensified
<br />
their IR components, as if it was attempting to warm the
<br />
beleaguered hedgehog's heart.  Still no reaction from him.  The
<br />
rays persisted, as if hoping that the hedgehog would appreciate
<br />
their attempt to lighten his mood.  Sonic steadfastly maintained
<br />
his hunched-over, sulking position.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Man,' he thought to himself, his mind replete with anxiety,
<br />
'what am I gonna do with myself?  Sal and everyone else is too
<br />
busy to do anything with me.  I can't even help them out, since
<br />
I don't have a clue as to even half the stuff they're doing.
<br />
I'm gettin' tired of being the Number One hedgehog, 'cause
<br />
there's nothing for me to do at the top.  Maybe I need to step
<br />
down, give someone else a chance to save Mobius.  But who?'
<br />
Sonic had no answer to that question, one that had fused itself
<br />
into his mind gradually over the period of time after the
<br />
destruction of the Doomsday Project.  Everyone had a position to
<br />
fill but him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I wanted to teach the kids, let them know how it's done being
<br />
a Freedom Fighter,' Sonic's private tirade continued.  'But
<br />
Tails got a hold of that, maybe I taught the big guy TOO well.
<br />
Sal's been working on managerial whatever-she-calls-it for who
<br />
knows how long, and I ain't any good at that.  I can't even get
<br />
a hold of Rotor, since he's always either asleep or working on
<br />
that project of his.  And Dulcy's not going anywhere, not with
<br />
that hurt leg she got making that bad landing a few weeks ago.'
<br />
A labored sigh of dismissal. 'What's a hedgehog like me to do?'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sound of differentially-displaced air brought Sonic to his
<br />
full alert condition, ready to react to any form of danger.  The
<br />
sound was very familiar, but something he had not heard for a
<br />
long time, or so it seemed to him.  The sound gradually wavered,
<br />
then abruptly ended as an expertly-placed drop to the ground was
<br />
executed by a ten year-old red fox.  The fox then paced over to
<br />
Sonic's position, with a distressed look on his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's ya up to, Sonic?&quot; the concerned red vulpine queried his
<br />
best friend and mentor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nothing at all, Tails,&quot; the hedgehog responded, sighing.
<br />
&quot;What's a cool dude like you doing hanging around a major drag
<br />
like me for?&quot; he questioned, not without a slight hint of
<br />
frustration to his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you been looking really down lately, Sonic.  I know it's
<br />
that you've had nothing to do here, now that Robotnik and
<br />
Sneezeley's gone.  I thought I might be able to do something to
<br />
cheer you up,&quot; Tails said, unable to keep the hopefulness out of
<br />
his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Why, that little genius,' Sonic thought, his face copious with
<br />
surprise.  'He read my mind.'  He said nothing, expecting Tails
<br />
to continue prodding the point further.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was not disappointed.  &quot;I did have a class to teach today,
<br />
but I told everyone else to take the day off.  So, how about it,
<br />
Sonic?&quot; the little cub demanded, uncertain what method the
<br />
dispirited hedgehog would use to respond with.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Tails' turn to not be disappointed.  &quot;Sure, big guy,&quot;
<br />
Sonic finally replied, after contemplating the current
<br />
alteration in plans for the day.  He gently stroked Tails' head
<br />
with an almost religious reverence, and stared straight into his
<br />
eyes with a smile on his face.  &quot;It'll be just like old times,
<br />
you and me together.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails chuckled a bit, then said with sincerity, &quot;Yeah, just
<br />
like old times.  Race ya past the lookout tower!&quot;  He then
<br />
curled his tails together, then slowly levitated from the ground
<br />
as his tails rotated around their mutual center of axis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, hold up a bit!&quot; Sonic exclaimed jocularly, all evidence
<br />
of downslide in his normally cavorting mood eliminated for the
<br />
time being.  Accelerating in place, he called to his airborne
<br />
comrade, &quot;OK, three.....two....one....juice time!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They discharged themselves from the area as quickly as their
<br />
respective legs or tails would permit them, and accelerated
<br />
toward their arbitrary finish line.  The race had begun, and
<br />
Sonic felt like a new hedgehog again.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few hours of high-velocity enjoyment (amplified by
<br />
giving Antoine a few moments of fright by rocketing next to the
<br />
tree where he was assigned as lookout), Sonic and Tails returned
<br />
to Knothole, halting about three meters in front of Rotor's
<br />
workshop.  They were both so exuberant, that Sonic forgot his
<br />
former mode of depression, and Tails forgot that his friend was
<br />
depressed.  As if remembering something, Sonic quirked his eyes
<br />
toward his two-tailed companion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, man!  I give up, Tails!  You beat me every time!&quot; Sonic
<br />
blurted out, with an expression of mock anger on his face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, gee,&quot; Tails retorted in kind, mimicking Sonic's facial
<br />
expression, &quot;next time, I'll make sure I beat you by more than a
<br />
few seconds!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More hopelessly uncontrollable laughter flowed from their
<br />
mouths.  Unable to repress the urge, they embraced and kissed
<br />
each other, like long-lost friends that had met again after
<br />
years of separation.  Sonic was beginning to feel more like
<br />
himself again, and he enjoyed it as much as Tails did.  He felt
<br />
as if he had finally found a role to conform to in Knothole, and
<br />
that was to be Tails' friend.  An act of gratitude that he had
<br />
not had the time to display recently, and he pondered over why
<br />
he didn't do such a thing sooner.  He found no answer to his
<br />
personal inquiry, and didn't concern himself with that at the
<br />
moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sonic,&quot; the young vulpine said to his associate in
<br />
gaiety, after regaining control of his guffawing, &quot;how about we
<br />
go see Rotor and Bookshire?  I bet ya they're working on that
<br />
new project right now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more senior hedgehog considered the matter for a few
<br />
seconds, with his arms crossed and his left foot rapping the
<br />
ground.  &quot;I don't know, kid,&quot; he said thoughtfully.  &quot;They might
<br />
be too busy to worry about us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, come on, Sonic,&quot; his little friend pleaded.  &quot;Besides,
<br />
they invited me to come over here yesterday.  They said that it
<br />
might be ready to show off now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More silence and concerned thought from the hedgehog.  He
<br />
wasn't entirely enthusiastic about interrupting Rotor and
<br />
Bookshire in the middle of what they regarded as an important
<br />
activity, since none of the technobabble would make any coherent
<br />
sense to him anyway.  However, he was interested in at least
<br />
knowing what the project was, considering the fact that the
<br />
specifics and even generalities had been concealed from him.
<br />
When he was satisfied with his decision, he replied, &quot;OK, Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;Let's see what their little secret project is.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two companions trotted to the entrance of Rotor's workshop.
<br />
&nbsp;They arrived together at the door, and came to an uneasy stop.
<br />
For reasons unknown to him, Sonic somehow forfeited his nerve to
<br />
enter the hut.  His former reservations resurfaced, as he
<br />
thought about how too premeditated and convenient this encounter
<br />
appeared to be.  The windows emitted no illumination from the
<br />
interior, and something about the way Tails dictated his
<br />
suggestion forced the hedgehog to delay his advance.  He looked
<br />
to his friend;  Tails revealed nothing, but patiently waited for
<br />
the hedgehog to signal a request for entry.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Go ahead, Sonic,&quot; his two-tailed comrade commanded
<br />
encouragingly, &quot;knock on the door.  It won't bite.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reluctant hedgehog complied with the order, totally
<br />
prepared for what he expected to happen.  He was equally
<br />
unprepared for the unexpected events.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The door opened, with a suspicious creaking sound attached to
<br />
its movement on the hinges.  A shaded figure of a blue walrus
<br />
lingered inside, beyond the doorway in the darkness.  He
<br />
gestured to them for passage, and the hedgehog and fox gradually
<br />
paced into the dimmed workshop.  Sonic gazed around the
<br />
blanketing blackness, endeavoring to focus his eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As if in retaliation, the room suddenly altered in form.  He
<br />
was blinded by the sudden increase in illumination, and deafened
<br />
by the multitude of voices crying out the word, &quot;Surprise!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Whoa,' Sonic thought to himself, 'what's going on here?'  He
<br />
rubbed his eyes to compensate for the appearance of light where
<br />
there was only an unlit region about two seconds ago.  After his
<br />
eyes finally terminated the task of focusing, he noticed that
<br />
all his friends in and out of Knothole were waiting for him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally walked over to the baffled hedgehog.  &quot;Surprise, Sonic.
<br />
I hope you like it,&quot; she said, then kissed him.  &quot;I'm sorry that
<br />
we've been keeping you in the dark about this, but now's a good
<br />
a time as any to reveal it to you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's jaw dropped with an almost audible thunk.  &quot;You mean,&quot;
<br />
he ventured, &quot;that all this time you've been busy working on
<br />
whatever that is?  And you were fibbing about all that
<br />
administrative work you were doing?&quot;  His outstretched finger
<br />
indicated the endoskeleton and the vat full of the prepared
<br />
organic mixture.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Bookshire's turn to explain the rationale of their
<br />
former, &quot;busy&quot; atmosphere.  He carefully limped over to Sonic to
<br />
illustrate the actual scene of events.  &quot;Not exactly, Sonic,&quot; he
<br />
answered to his confused juvenile comrade.  &quot;You see, we know
<br />
that you've been bored and all, with nothing to do here at
<br />
Knothole while the rest of Mobius isn't in danger anymore.  So
<br />
we decided that you probably wanted to step down off your
<br />
command status so that you would have more time to do other
<br />
things.  That's when the idea came up to design a new Freedom
<br />
Fighter.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;New Freedom Fighter?&quot; the hedgehog inquired.  &quot;To replace me?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It can take whatever position in the chain of command you
<br />
want,&quot; the raccoon continued, &quot;it can be the commander of
<br />
Knothole, or like a first officer to you.  It's your choice,
<br />
Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What about training and everything else?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry about this one.  The new artificial lifeform will
<br />
be totally self-sufficient, and it's programmed to have basic
<br />
emotions, ability to command, repair itself, and other
<br />
functions.  We also gave it the ability to dynamically respond
<br />
to new situations, learn from them.  Not a problem at all,&quot; the
<br />
experienced raccoon reassured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's it repair itself?&quot; the still-cynical hedgehog asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It has nanites in it to take care of damage and construct new
<br />
parts,&quot; Bookshire replied.  Seeing a shocked expression on the
<br />
hedgehog's face again, he continued, &quot;No, not those nanites.
<br />
These nanites aren't programmed to do anything to us;  their
<br />
made for the compuorganic lifeform.&quot;  Bookshire was all too
<br />
aware of the unpleasant memories the word had to Sonic, not to
<br />
mention the rest of the Freedom Fighters.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool.  So when's it gonna be active?&quot; the now-interested Sonic
<br />
questioned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails took charge of leading him to the main computer.  &quot;Right
<br />
over on that computer, Sonic.  Press that big red switch.&quot;  As
<br />
he and his companion walked to the computer, Tails didn't notice
<br />
the large bundle of cables lying stretched out across the floor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saw the cables first.  &quot;Tails, the ca-&quot; he tried to warn
<br />
his friend.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too late.  Tails foot located the cables and reacted via
<br />
the appropriate physical laws of the universe, long before his
<br />
eyes could see them and direct his body to avoid.  He flew
<br />
across the space between his former location and the main
<br />
computer, his nose impacting with the indicated red key that
<br />
would activate the new lifeform.  Before his blackout, Tails
<br />
slid down the side of the computer, opening one of the storage
<br />
compartments.  After coming to rest on the floor in a
<br />
semi-unconsious state, mind probing electrodes attached
<br />
themselves to his head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The room exploded into a blinding radiance. Inside the vat with
<br />
the organic mixture, the component atoms combined and
<br />
recombined, forming a DNA structure over the endoskeletal frame.
<br />
&nbsp;The nanites worked hard at their labors, manipulating the
<br />
organic overlay into the appropriate electrical and organic
<br />
constituents.  Influxes of data came from Tails, as the cranial
<br />
positronic unit scanned the information by utilizing the remote
<br />
electrodes on his head.  The process continued on for about ten
<br />
seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails woke up to see a black and dark gray fox, about his
<br />
height and size, trapped in the glass vat.  One powerful fist
<br />
strike later, and glass shards erupted from the vat, spreading
<br />
over the floor like a tidal wave crashes over a ocean-front
<br />
city.  Everyone else in the room watched in horror as the new
<br />
artificial lifeform slowly paced across the room in a precise,
<br />
measured cadence toward Tails, making no sound as it did.  When
<br />
it arrived at its location in front of its organic counterpart,
<br />
it gently and flawlessly lifted the dazed vulpine up to examine
<br />
his condition.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What the compuorganic lifeform said was even more startling.
<br />
&quot;What has occurred to format my brother into his current state?&quot;
<br />
it demanded, seemingly concerned about Tails' condition.  The
<br />
voice was so much like Tails, only this particular vocalization
<br />
was that of an adolescent fox.  It was deeper and slightly
<br />
harsher, yet still very similar to that of its organic
<br />
counterpart.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails replied for all the observers in the room.  &quot;Waht?&quot; he
<br />
asked, bewildered by the turn of events.  He attempted to force
<br />
the stinging pain from his nose.  &quot;Wo's 'or bro'her?  I ain' 'or
<br />
bro'her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The artificial lifeform didn't have any difficulty interpreting
<br />
its &quot;brother's&quot; speech.  &quot;My medical sensors detect a minor
<br />
concussion in your olfactory region, and it is in my estimation
<br />
that you have been injured in a procedure which I am unaware of.
<br />
&nbsp;Please allow me, brother, to attend to your ailments.  I have
<br />
no intention of inducing any detriment to your organic
<br />
configuration.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The awestruck organic fox's eyes expanded wide with primal
<br />
fear.  He struggled to escape from the grasp of his oppressor,
<br />
and succeeded in his savage body motions.  Tails screamed,
<br />
staring a hardened sneer into the compuorganic's video
<br />
receptors, &quot;You're not my brother, and I never want to see you
<br />
again, you robot!&quot;  He darted out of the workshop before anyone
<br />
could detain him, and disappeared into the Great Forest.  The
<br />
new lifeform could only observe the scene that occurred,
<br />
speechless and almost upset by the unfavorable reaction that
<br />
Tails displayed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Someone's gotta go after Tails,&quot; Sonic finally said, returning
<br />
to reality again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll take care of this,&quot; replied Dulcy.  &quot;Besides, he can fly,
<br />
and I might have a better chance of getting him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Dulce,&quot; the baffled hedgehog queried, &quot;what about your
<br />
leg?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, this?&quot; she answered.  &quot;This was the only way I could think
<br />
of from telling you about the project too early.  There's
<br />
nothing wrong with it.  You know how much I can babble at
<br />
times.&quot;  As if proving her point that her leg had sustained no
<br />
damage, she prodded out of the hut and used it to force herself
<br />
away from the ground, then flew off to retrieve Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally walked over to comfort their latest addition to the
<br />
Freedom Fighter group.  &quot;Are you OK?&quot; she asked, concerned about
<br />
how it would react to prejudice immediately after it had just
<br />
been constructed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took in a deep breath, as if to calm itself.  &quot;I am fully
<br />
functional, physically and mentally,&quot; it stated, &quot;however, I am
<br />
rather perturbed by the way Tails reacted to my endeavors to
<br />
assist him.  I also realize that lack a denomination, something
<br />
for others to know me by.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought the matter over.  &quot;How about....David?&quot; she
<br />
suggested.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well, then,&quot; the compuorganic replied, &quot;that shall be
<br />
sufficient for my purposes of identification.&quot;  He smiled, as if
<br />
pleased with the privilege of having a name.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally embraced and kissed him, gratified to have him as a new
<br />
Freedom Fighter and companion.  Not quite certain how to respond
<br />
to this gesture of kindness, he returned the act to her, making
<br />
certain his finely-tuned tactile sensors returned signals of a
<br />
firm, but tame grip.  David did not desire to destroy a
<br />
near-future ally in the college of life.
