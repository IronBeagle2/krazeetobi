<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; The PRINCESS SALLY mini-series just didn't do well enough to warrant another
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; shot. From what we can tell, it seems there was a problem with distribution
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which prevented a lot of people from finding and picking up the book. You
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; also had the core audience of little boys that felt awkward picking up a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; title that they felt was aimed more at girls. However, when you plopped a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; copy into their hands and made them read the first issue, that's all it took.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; They were hooked.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; We received a lot of applause from various fans who did read the books and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; liked what we did. Both Mike and I wanted a more serious tone to the series
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to make it just different enough to justify having it stand on its own.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
And you're both to be congratulated for it.  While I may not have said
<br />
as much in so many words, &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; represented very
<br />
strong writing.  As someone else observed, it was one of the most
<br />
complex plotlines to appear in the comics and yet it managed to retain
<br />
readers' interest.  It deserved a better fate; I can be a witness that
<br />
in my corner of the country (southwestern Michigan), I really wasn't
<br />
sure where or when to find it on the stands.  I ended up sending away
<br />
for all three issues.
<br />

<br />
I'd like your permission to quote from some of your posts and revise FAQ
<br />
#7: &quot;What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?&quot;  I'd never thought
<br />
that we'd get an answer to the question straight from Archie: I pretty
<br />
much had the Sonic-Gram in Sonic #21 and the ads for the miniseries in
<br />
Sonic #22 to go on -- kinda like when the CIA used to try figuring out
<br />
who's on first in the USSR from who stands where on top of Lenin's Tomb
<br />
during the May Day parades.  It would be good to have an authoritative
<br />
answer, but netiquette dictates that I get your permission even though
<br />
you've posted to the list already.  E-mail me directly, please.
<br />

<br />
I'd also like to quote your post on the use of meat analogs in chili
<br />
dogs and update FAQ #11.  I know it seems weird to be preoccupied with
<br />
this stuff, but I think the only two subjects that have REALLY taken up
<br />
a lot of bandwidth are a) Is/isn't Sally a fox? (the pro-fox believers
<br />
are serious die-hards), and b) the origin of Tails' tails [FAQs #4 and
<br />
#1, respectively].
