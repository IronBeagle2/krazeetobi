<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hey... that's great!  Finally a rep from Sega!  Well, being a 32X owner I
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;expect great things from it.  From what I have seen from Chaotix... it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;looks pretty impressive... one question... Where is Sonic?!?!?  As I
</em><br />

<br />
Well, Sega didn't send me---I'm here on my own, but I'll help where ever I 
<br />
can.  :)
<br />
You know that here at Sega of America (SOA) we are committed to supporting 
<br />
the 32X, so you can expect a lot of software support for it.  Chaotix is 
<br />
just one example.  To answer your question, Sonic won't be appearing in 
<br />
Chaotix, because that's Knuckles' game.  (I don't know the real reason, so 
<br />
I'll just throw out that excuse.  Actually, see below)  :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;understand it... Sonic will make his appearance on the Japanese version
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of the game and not the American.  Is Sega of America focusing on
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Knuckles instead of our favorite blue speed demon?  I think that the
</em><br />

<br />
I haven't heard that one before.  I believe both versions are going to be 
<br />
the same, but ya never know---Sega of Japan sometimes goes off and does 
<br />
their own thing.  We do have an original 32X version of Sonic in the works, 
<br />
so SOA hasn't forgotten about our blue-friend.
<br />
Although, according to recent SOA marketing studies, Knuckles is a very 
<br />
popular guy... So popular that the execs felt he deserved his own game.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;characters should use the rings for more that just.. well.. points and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;keeping from getting you killed!  How about the rings as weapons, tossed
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;projectiles?  I really liked the idea for Super Sonic using the rings as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;time for being Super.
</em><br />

<br />
Thanks for the input!
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just as a side note... isn't Chaotix the next 32X &quot;Sonic&quot; type game or
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;are you talking about another version?  If it's another version... try a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;32X-CD Sonic game... now that would rock!  How about that Sonic arcade
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;game that never really made it?  Are they only going to bring out Sonic
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Arcade for the Saturn or will be playing it on out 32X?
</em><br />

<br />
Chaotix is a 32X &quot;Sonic-type&quot; of game, but it isn't the game I was referring 
<br />
to.
<br />
As for the 32X-CD Sonic game---talk about a niche within a niche.  :)
<br />

<br />
The Sonic arcade game was apparently released in Japan, but never made it 
<br />
out to the States---I don't know why.  I know there is a Sonic game in the 
<br />
works for the Saturn, but it's being done over at Sega of Japan, so I have 
<br />
very little information on it.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hmmm... maybe I have more questions than suggestions.  Oh well *:(.  BTW,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I work for Electronics Boutique and I am considered the resident Sega and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sonic expert so if there are any little tid-bits of info you could send
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;my way, it would be greatly appreciated!
</em><br />

<br />
Since you work for EB, you probably have a good idea of what consumers would 
<br />
like.  There's been a lot of asking for a Tails-only game:  How do you think 
<br />
consumers would react to that type of game, assuming it was a game in 
<br />
similar fashion to the &quot;Sonic-series&quot; of games, only better utilizing the 
<br />
abilities of our flying fox?
<br />
