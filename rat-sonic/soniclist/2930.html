<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salar-Alicia was not, as might have been guessed, a frail
<br />
flower of gentility or anything else so inane.  Neither was she a
<br />
warrior, though, and warrior or not the sight of two of Roboth-
<br />
Amon's Iron Golems stepping through her mirror would startle-- and
<br />
panic-- anyone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It certainly didn't do much for the Princess' nerves at the
<br />
moment.  As the guardsman and the Hedgehog burst into her quarters,
<br />
the swordbunny close behind with the sorcerer, they froze at the
<br />
tableau.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We cannot attack, lest we harm ze princess,&quot;  whispered
<br />
Antos.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can't just stand here, mage,&quot; hissed Son-Ak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah don't suppose y'all got a better idea?&quot; added Bunnie, her
<br />
distress allowing her southlander accent to bleed through.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside the window, a shadow-cloaked figure watched.  Sniv,
<br />
master thief, spy, and assassin, viewed the scene with mixed
<br />
satisfaction and horror.  A job well done, certainly, and his
<br />
master would be pleased at it's efficiency, but he had never felt
<br />
comfortable around the implacable golems of Roboth-Amon.  He was
<br />
certain that he never would.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discomfited as he was, though, he could not repress a grin of
<br />
satisfaction as another golem stepped through the mirror.  Whatever
<br />
else others might think, Sniv did his job well.  He saw no possible
<br />
flaw in the &quot;exercise&quot; this night.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Below the window, Milos and his charge were approaching the
<br />
palace, preparing to wind about to the rear, and the kitchen doors.
<br />
The little fox had always had sharp eyes (a dull-eyed thief tends
<br />
not to last long-- not with both hands, at any rate) and he was
<br />
noticing something almost invisible up higher on the wall.
<br />
Thinking in terms of a master burglar, an idea came to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cleth,&quot;  he told the kitten, &quot;Wait here.  I wanna get a look
<br />
at that guy.  Maybe I can learn something.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What guy?&quot;  Cleth asked.  &quot;I don't see no guy, Tails.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails grinned.  &quot;That's one of the MANY reasons why I am your
<br />
fearless leader, little one.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought it was because you could thump Raffer whenever he
<br />
gets out of line,&quot; replied the kitten doubtfully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That too,&quot; agreed Tails.  &quot;Wait here-- in the shadows.  I'll
<br />
be right back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stepping to one side, out of sight of any passers-by, Milos
<br />
doffed his cloak and once again began to spin the twin tails that
<br />
had given him his nickname.  He rose up from the littered streets,
<br />
into the air-  and, incidentally, destiny.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a fourth golem began to emerge from the mirror, Son-Ak
<br />
decided to make his move.  Stepping forwards, he slowly placed his
<br />
axe at his feet, in a gesture of apparent surrender.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Watching from his citadel in the Eastrealm, Roboth-Amon
<br />
smiled.  What had been planned as a test seemed to be developing
<br />
into a successful abduction instead.  He decided to indulge
<br />
himself.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Apparently the previous altercation was, after all, a matter
<br />
of luck,&gt;&gt; came a gravelly voice from the mirror.  The glass
<br />
wavered, as though it were a pond that had been struck by a handful
<br />
of pebbles, and the face of the Dark Wizard appeared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not a pretty face.  Massive jowls framed a almost
<br />
conical head, with a black skullcap and a bristling red mustache.
<br />
Most would have called the race Human, but there was an undefinable
<br />
air of inhumanity about it.  Especially in the eyes-- eyes with no
<br />
whites, but instead black onyx-like sheen with tiny red pinpricks
<br />
of glow, like coals.  Whatever Roboth-Amon had been, years of
<br />
trafficking in dark magics had changed him into something else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; How unexpectedly fortunate it is,&gt;&gt; the apparition
<br />
continued.  &lt;&lt;I had planned a small test of the barbarian's
<br />
prowess.  Instead, I gain the princess as a... guest, as well as
<br />
one can hope surety of her father's co-operation.  When he returns
<br />
from his western journeys, he shall no doubt be more tractable than
<br />
in the past.&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie stood, unwilling to act while one of the golems held
<br />
her princess.  Antos tensed, holding power in his frame, but unable
<br />
to release it while the ground-squirrel was held. And Son-Ak--
<br />
grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Prowess?&quot;, he murmured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before anyone could react, the hedgehog leapt up into the air,
<br />
tucking into a roll.  Again, as he had in the tavern the day
<br />
before, he spun with inconceivable velocity, hurtling towards the
<br />
golem holding the Princess, this time slicing through the
<br />
restraining arm.  As Salar-Alicia fell, half-conscious, he
<br />
rebounded off the far wall, caught her, and half-spun, half-leaped
<br />
behind the swordbunny and the fox-mage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your turn, friends,&quot;  Son-ak laughed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antos suddenly snarled out something-- something in a language
<br />
that somehow Son-Ak could not quite hear, could not quite know.  A
<br />
Bright green blast of light erupted from his palms, shattering the
<br />
now- damaged golem.  As he turned to smite another, Bunnie drew her
<br />
great blade and attacked a third, wielding it with fearsome skill.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak handed the dazed Princess to the guardsman and
<br />
reclaimed his axe, and then erupted into the chilling battlecry of
<br />
his tribe.  Again the axe spun in a silvered circle, and again he
<br />
struck the remaining golem, shattering it's shell.  As he turned to
<br />
attack another, he saw Antos melt-- literally melt-- one of the two
<br />
remaining ones, and Bunnie, with what even he had to admit was
<br />
amazing skill, strike the final golem in it's visor, causing it to
<br />
shatter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeeee----alllhhhhhhhhhh!&quot;  Son-Ak screamed.  &quot;Prowess, you
<br />
wanted, fat one?  THUS is the prowess of Son-Ak of the Cad-Hai, the
<br />
runner, the smiter, the warrior,--&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt; The insufferable.  If I cannot have my prize, then no one
<br />
shall.&gt;&gt;  The face faded from th mirror, just as it exploded, and
<br />
a dark, smoky burst of eldritch force struck the princess-- and
<br />
cast her out of the window.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fate.  It's out there.  It makes kings of vagabonds, jesters
<br />
of wise men, and hack fanwriters of computer students.  It can also
<br />
make a hero out of a ten year old fox, at the right moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Milos had no idea what had happened.  Just as he had gotten to
<br />
the level of the window, all hell had-- apparently-- broken loose.
<br />
Perhaps it was some rich-person thing, he guessed.  Then the
<br />
chadowy figure had vanished, slipping into darker shadows, and a
<br />
figure suddenly flew out the window.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails didn't think.  He simply reacted.  If some-one is
<br />
falling, you catch them.  And so he dove, grabbed a leg, and
<br />
desparately held on until he could lower the form to safety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which is how Milos, Sneak thief, Gang leader, and half-
<br />
educated street-urchin, became the Ward of Salar-Alicia, Princess
<br />
of House Acorn, Heir to the throne of Mobius.  Had he known how his
<br />
life was to be upset, he might have let her fall.
<br />
