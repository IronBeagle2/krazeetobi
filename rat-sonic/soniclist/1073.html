<br />
Story:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lone shuttle flew through the night skies.  On board, Packbell 
<br />
sat in the pilots seat with a grim expression on his face.  He had been 
<br />
called back to Robotropolis to perform one of the lowest services anybody 
<br />
could be asked to perform, new prisoner orientation.  Normally, when a 
<br />
large group of rebels were captured, they were officially charged with 
<br />
treason against Robotnik, found guilty and sentenced to the robotizizer 
<br />
after an agonizingly long stay in the holding cells.  Normally, a 
<br />
Swat-bot was assigned to give the orientation, but, for some reason, 
<br />
Packbell had been selected for this duty.  As a First Class Commander, 
<br />
prisoner orientation was listed under his job duties, but he was rarely 
<br />
assigned it because both he and Robotnik knew there were better things 
<br />
Packbell could be doing with his time.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell sighed as he set the shuttle down in a landing bay.  
<br />
Stopping by his quarters to grab his dress cloak, he headed to the 
<br />
prisoner orientation chamber.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chamber was massive.  It had fifty rows of benches facing a 
<br />
raised podium.  Behind the podium was a large screen on which could be 
<br />
displayed the many terrible robotization and interrigation recordings 
<br />
that were always made.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell stood behind the podium and waited patiently.  Soon, 
<br />
Swat-bots began escorting rebel freedom fighters into the room.  It was 
<br />
the typical scene that Packbell was so used to.  Some silent, some 
<br />
crying, some glaring at him in defiance, families holding to one 
<br />
another.  How pathetic, thought Packbell.  Soon, the entire group was 
<br />
sitting in front of him.  He began to speak from the script that sat in 
<br />
his memory.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As a Commander in the Robotropolis Central Command, it is my 
<br />
duty to inform you that you have all been charged with treason against 
<br />
the Emporor of Mobius, Ivo Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At those words, some leaped up and began shouting words of 
<br />
defiance.  Packbell rarely listened to such nonsense.  The Swat-bots 
<br />
quickly silenced them by shooting warning shots over the heads of the 
<br />
crowd.  When the crowd quieted down, he continued.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Haveing been so charged, you have been tried based on an 
<br />
evaluation of your general behavior, and have, consequently been found 
<br />
guilty.  You are therefore sentenced to the robotizizer after intense 
<br />
interrigation, and a stay in our holding cells until such time as we need 
<br />
more worker-bots.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this some began trembling in fear, while some still haven't 
<br />
recovered from the shock of what was happening.  Suddenly, a raccoon who 
<br />
had apparently snapped from the stress, jumped up and made a desprate run 
<br />
for the door.  Before anybody could react, Packbell pulled a laser rifle 
<br />
and shot three blasts, each of which slammed into the prisoner, throwing 
<br />
him against the wall where he collapsed in a lifeless heap.  The 
<br />
prisoners stared in shock and terror at Packbell, who was still holding the 
<br />
smoking rifle.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyone else feel like dying tonight?&quot; he asked, placing the 
<br />
rifle back under the podium &quot;if so, please feel free to make a run for 
<br />
any of the exits provided.  While you're here, there's one thing you need 
<br />
to understand.  I care nothing for your futile little lives, and I have 
<br />
no reservations about relieving you of each and every one of them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned to the Swat-bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take them away,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the Swat-bots began to excort the prisoners from the room, 
<br />
Packbell suddenly had an idea.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait!&quot; he yelled.  The Swat-bots stopped where they were.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a single sweep of the room, he analized each prisoner 
<br />
individualy.  After make delibrate calculations, he arrived at a conclusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take the twenty prisoners in the back row to my experiment 
<br />
holding cells,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Acknowleged,&quot; responded the bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell was getting tired of experimenting on worker-bots.  Some 
<br />
live subjects might just provide some better results.  He doubted that 
<br />
any of the prisoners would survive the proccess, but then, that was their 
<br />
problem.  Packbell left the prison block and headed for the Scientific 
<br />
Research Building.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Charles Hedgehog was widely know among the resistance for his 
<br />
logical attitude and somber manner when it came to getting a job done.  
<br />
What was not well known was that a part of him always craved living life 
<br />
on the edge, and playing the part of a Freedom Fighter spy deep inside 
<br />
Robotropolis was about as close to the edge as one could get without 
<br />
falling over completely.  Not that he took the job lightly, he was always 
<br />
very serious about it, because if he were ever found out, he'd be 
<br />
interrogated and either reprogrammed or sent to the scrap pile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having finished his duty cycle, he quietly slipped away from the 
<br />
other worker-bots and went to the his hideout to continue with a few 
<br />
things he had to do.  First, however, he sat down in front of his 
<br />
computer and tapped into the section were Commanders post their daily 
<br />
progress reports to see if anything remotely important had happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he scrolled down the list, everything appeared to be pretty 
<br />
much the same, that is, until he got to Packbell's entry:
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

AUTHORIZATION: 458-5874412-55
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is ridiculous, thought Chuck, if this keeps up, Sally won't have
<br />
any freedom fighters left to contact even if she does find her father's 
<br />
list.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He connected to the prison block records to check on the status 
<br />
of the new prisoners.  Some could be rescued if they were being held in 
<br />
the right areas.  Looking over the reports, he noticed something unusual.
<br />
The number of new prisoners proccessed was 145.  Chuck stopped and 
<br />
thought a moment.  Packbell had reported a score of 165, so someone was 
<br />
off by twenty.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The more he thought, the more Chuck began to worry.  This was the
<br />
tenth discrepancy in the records regarding prisoners and worker-bots in 
<br />
the last four months, and, in every error, Packbell had somehow been 
<br />
involved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chuck realized that something was going on, and he was beginning 
<br />
to think that not even Robotnik might know.  Calling a messenger bird to 
<br />
him, Chuck dispatched a message to the Great Forest.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep in the Great Forest, in Knothole Village, the freedom 
<br />
fighters slept soundly.  The small bird flew, unnoticed, down past 
<br />
various huts until it came to rest in the window of the hut belonging to 
<br />
Princess Sally.  Sally lay in bed next to the window in a sound sleep.  
<br />
The bird began chirping rather loudly until Sally groggily woke up to see 
<br />
what the problem was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the window, she took the note from the bird and read it 
<br />
as the bird flew away.
<br />

<br />
To Knothole Freedom Fighters,
<br />

<br />
Prisoners have been disappearing en route between their orientation and 
<br />
the prison block.  Suspect Packbell is taking them to an unknown location 
<br />
for some purpose.  Request any ideas on what to do.
<br />

<br />
Respond ASAP
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked at the clock on the wall.   No matter how serious 
<br />
such a problem was, no one was going to have good, suggestive ideas at 
<br />
this hour.  Folding the note and placing it on her nightstand, Sally went 
<br />
back to bed and would handle it first thing in the morning.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell walked into a chamber deep in his research center.  In 
<br />
the center was a long table with shackles on it.  Above it, hanging from 
<br />
the ceiling was a semi-circular piece of metal which appeared to have 
<br />
laser scanners attached to it, which could be moved up and down the 
<br />
length of the table.  At one end of the room was a large display screen, 
<br />
and at the other end was a large set of controls facing the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell went behind the controls and sat down.  Pressing his 
<br />
hand to a sensor on the panel, he powered the system.  For a few moments, 
<br />
he sat listening as the machine quietly sucked power from the Central 
<br />
Power Core to serve his secret, twisted purposes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, the door to the room opened and two Swat-bots entered, 
<br />
escorting a frightened looking badger who they promptly strapped down to 
<br />
the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, citizen,&quot; said Packbell in a voice so friendly, it 
<br />
would fool all but the most cautious &quot;You might as well stop struggling, 
<br />
you can't leave.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The badger calmed after awhile and simply glared at Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now, don't be like that,&quot; continued Packbell, still speaking as 
<br />
though he were the badger's comrade &quot;Just because you've been found 
<br />
guilty of treason doesn't mean that we can't be friends.  In fact, you 
<br />
should feel honored that you're here instead of back in the prison 
<br />
block.  You see, you have been chosen to take part in an experiment that 
<br />
will change the way people think of computers and robotics forever.  
<br />
First, however, I despise having to call you 'prisoner' so why don't you 
<br />
introduce yourself.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After glaring at Packbell for a moment, the badger responded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My name's Hugo,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hugo?  Pleased to meet you, I'm Packbell, but you already know 
<br />
that,&quot; said Packbell, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now then,&quot; Packbell continued &quot;Let's get down to business.  All 
<br />
you have to do for this experiment is to lie perfectly still.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a few buttons on the panel, as the laser scanners 
<br />
began glowing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, by the way,&quot; said Packbell &quot;Good Luck.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laser scanners came on and shot down onto the badger.  The 
<br />
scanners moved down the length of the subject, examining each and every 
<br />
inch of him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Preliminary suject analysis complete,&quot; the computer reported.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Proceed to phase two, neural pathway analysis,&quot; ordered Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers changed color as they moved up towards the badger's 
<br />
head and stopped. They began an intense scan of the badger's brain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Analysis complete.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Begin Upload Processing analysis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers again scanned the badger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Analysis complete&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a few more buttons on the panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Begin full upload procedure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lasers changed color to red and concentrated all their energy 
<br />
on the badger's mind.  On the screen at the far end of the room, was 
<br />
displayed a 3-D wire frame model of the badger and an imense amount of 
<br />
unreadable information.  All seemed to be going well for the Commander 
<br />
and he felt a slight tinge of joy at a possible success.  Suddenly, the 
<br />
information on the screen changed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING! NEURAL IMBALANCE DETECTED.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What!!&quot; exclaimed Packbell, he joy turning to shock.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING! NEURAL PATHWAY COLAPSE POSSIBLE.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shut down the experiment!&quot; screamed Packbell above the noise of 
<br />
the alarms that had sounded as he began frantically pushing buttons on 
<br />
the panel.  The badger's body began jerking about violently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING!  NEURAL SYNAPSE COLLAPSE IN PROGRESS&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;WARNING!  SUBJECT VITAL SIGNS FAILING.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell managed to shut off the system.  Walking over the badger 
<br />
on the table, he glared at the still slightly twitching body.  After 
<br />
standing there for what seemed like an eternity, he turned and went to 
<br />
the comm. panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Send some bots in here to dispose of the body, and bring me 
<br />
another subject in one hour,&quot; he ordered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning off the panel, he walked back to the system controls.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm going to get this experiment right if I have to kill every 
<br />
Mobian on the face of the planet!!!&quot; he declared, and began going through 
<br />
the program for the thousanth time looking for bugs.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, the freedom fighters met in the war room to 
<br />
discuss Uncle Chuck's latest message.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The idea that Packbell is kidnapping prisoners for his own 
<br />
twisted purposes is a frightening thought,&quot; Sally was saying &quot;We've got 
<br />
to find out what he's doing with them.  any ideas?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just the obvious one, Sal,&quot; responded Sonic &quot;Jam to Robotropolis 
<br />
and find out.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you know we can't go running to Robotropolis without a 
<br />
solid plan.  We don't even know exactly what we're looking for,&quot; Sally said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She turned to Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have you had any luck locating info on this, Bookshire?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not much,&quot; he admitted &quot;Packbell has always suspected that 
<br />
someone's been sneaking into the Core so he code-locks all his personal 
<br />
files.  I'm examining other areas to see if he forgot something, but 
<br />
it'll take time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, until we have a better idea of what's happening, there's 
<br />
not much we can do,&quot; said Sally &quot;Bookshire will continue work on on the 
<br />
computer system, but it might be a good idea to send one or two of us to 
<br />
Robotropolis to follow Packbell and see what he's up to.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, deep in Robotropolis, Bunnie and Sonic, both having 
<br />
volunteered to follow Packbell, arrived outside the main Command Center.  
<br />
After avoiding the guards, they managed to sneak inside through the 
<br />
ventelation system.  After taking many turns and searching many rooms, 
<br />
the team lucked out when they found Packbell.  He was in the main control 
<br />
room with Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You still haven't answered my question,&quot; Robotnik was saying to 
<br />
Snively &quot;Why are there prisoners missing from my holding cells!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I really don't know sir,&quot; responded Snivelly weakly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't give us that!&quot; said Packbell &quot;Do you have any idea how 
<br />
hard its been for me to capture these tratiors lately.  I've gone through 
<br />
a lot of trouble to get them and you lose them!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively glared at Packbell.  He knew that Packbell was at fault, 
<br />
but, with all the trust Robotnik had invested in his finest creation, he 
<br />
would never believe it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll keep looking into it sir,&quot; Snively said rather lamely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You do that,&quot; said Robotnik &quot;If you don't find out what happened 
<br />
to them, I'll give you to Packbell for target practice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes sir,&quot; said Snively, as he turned and left.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why do you keep him around, sir?&quot; asked Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know, sometimes I honestly don't know,&quot; responded Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do,&quot; said Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; replies Robotnik.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, walked from the room and out onto the side walk.  As he 
<br />
walked down the deserted street, Sonic and Bunnie followed close behind.  
<br />
They followed him to a small building.  AS he entered, Sonic and Bunnie 
<br />
stopped outside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; said Sonic &quot;I'm going to folow him in.  You stay out here 
<br />
in case he comes back.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got it suger-hog,&quot; said Bunnie.  She crouched in a dark 
<br />
corner of the street as Sonic went into the old building.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic crept down the corridor.  He looked around, but saw no sign 
<br />
of Packbell.  He contiued down the corridor, certain that he'd catch up 
<br />
to Packbell eventually.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie waited patiently behind a garbage can for Sonic or 
<br />
Packbell to emerge.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, without warning, a metalic hand shot out of the 
<br />
darkness behind her, grabbed her by the back of her neck and lifted her 
<br />
easily off the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Scream and die, rabbit,&quot; said a chillingly familiar voice.  The 
<br />
arm turned her around and she found herself face to face with Cmdr. 
<br />
Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Did you really think you could sneak up on someone with a 
<br />
proximity detector?&quot; asked Packbell, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without answering, Bunnie drove her robotic foot into Packbell's 
<br />
chest.  The Commander was unmoved.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Such is the advantage of dent-proof alloys,&quot; continued Packbell 
<br />
&quot;Now, why don't we go find your friend.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keeping Bunnie in a tight grip, he returned to the building.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had searched the entire building and found nothing.  As he 
<br />
returned to the entrance, a figure appeared in the doorway.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Greetings, hedgehog!&quot; said Packbell &quot;I believe this belongs to you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell held Bunnie firmly in his right hand.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let her go, metal head!&quot; ordered Sonic as he prepared to rush 
<br />
the commander.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wouldn't do that if I were you,&quot; remarked Packbell &quot;Your 
<br />
distance from me is such that you could never get to me in time to 
<br />
prevent me from breaking this beautiful rabbit's neck.  Now, I suggest 
<br />
you stay where you are unless you believe taking me down is worth your 
<br />
friend's death.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stopped where he was knowing that Packbell was right.  
<br />
There was no guarantee he could get to Packbell in time to save Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What do you want?&quot; asked Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just the two of you,&quot; Packbell replied &quot;I've sent a transmission 
<br />
to my team at the Research Center informing them you are on your way.  
<br />
You will go there and allow them to escort you to a special cell I made 
<br />
just for you.  If you have any ideas of doubling back, just remember that 
<br />
all I need is to hear your sonic boom and Bunnie is as good as dead.  Now 
<br />
go.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic wanted nothing more than to rip into Pakbell and tear him 
<br />
apart, but his logic finally won out.  He moved past Packbell and ran off 
<br />
towards the center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're friend appears to be a very reasonable person,&quot; Packbel 
<br />
remarked to Bunnie as they started for the center.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll never get away with this,&quot; said Bunnie defiantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, well, another satisfied member of the cliche of the month 
<br />
club,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lightning move, he shifted his grip on her neck, robbing her 
<br />
of her conciousness.  He continued walking towards the Research Center 
<br />
where his experiment awaited.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arriving at the Center, Packbell proceeded directly to the 
<br />
holding cells where Sonic sat in a cell guarded by ten Swat-bots.  Still 
<br />
keeping the unconcious Bunnie in his grip, he gazed at Sonic through the 
<br />
force field.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the deal, Packbell,&quot; demanded Sonic &quot;What have you been 
<br />
doing with these 'extra' prisoners?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That isn't your concern at the moment.  However, you'll find out 
<br />
soon enough,&quot; said Packbell &quot;It was a tough decision, but I have decided 
<br />
that you will be the next subject for my experiment.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pushed a button on the wall.  Suddenly, Sonic cell was 
<br />
filled with sleeping gas.  Sonic collapsed to the floor.  Packbell turned 
<br />
to one of the bots.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Take the hedgehog to the chamber,&quot; he ordered.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sonic began to wake, he realized he was strapped tightly to a 
<br />
long metal table in the middle of a large room.  Looking around, he saw 
<br />
Bunnie in the tight grip of a Swat-bot while Packbell began to power the 
<br />
machine.  Sonic struggled to break free, but something was holding him in 
<br />
place.  Watching him struggle, Packbell grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Force fields are wonderful things aren't they,&quot; he remarked 
<br />
&quot;Just relax.  I've worked out all the bugs this time so there shouldn't 
<br />
be any problems.  Granted, thats what I thought the last five times I 
<br />
tried it, but this time I'm sure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Is that what you do with those prisoners?&quot; demanded Bunnie &quot;You 
<br />
experiment on them?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course,&quot; answered Packbell, casually &quot;The worker-bots just 
<br />
weren't delivering the results I had hoped for.  They kept having neural 
<br />
breakdowns and had to be scrapped.  Some saved me the trouble by 
<br />
exploding.  Very intersting effects, but they were setbacks just the same.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're insane, Packbell,&quot; yelled Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, and you're fast.  Do you think I care?&quot; stated Packbell as 
<br />
the system powered up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THe system indicated it's readiness.  Packbell paused for a 
<br />
moment and gazes at Sonic, lying strapped to the table.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;See you in infinity,&quot; he said, simply.  He flipped a switch on 
<br />
the panel.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, that was the last thing Sonic remembered. . .
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cold . . .I'm cold.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such was Sonic's first thought.  Before he was aware of his 
<br />
surroundings, even before he was aware of his own body, he knew he was 
<br />
cold.  It wasn't quite like any cold he had remembered feeling before.  
<br />
It was hard for him to tell if the cold was coming from him or from the 
<br />
darkness surrounded him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After what seemed an eternity, he began to regain some of his 
<br />
senses.  His body was in one piece, at least that's how it felt.  
<br />
However, for some reason, it wouldn't move.  No matter what he tried, it 
<br />
wouldn't respond to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tried to get a bearing on where he was, but all that 
<br />
surrounded him was dark.  There was no light anywhere.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had happened?  Sonic's mind felt strange and fuzzy.  He 
<br />
could barely recall who he was much less what had happened to bring him 
<br />
to this dark place.  He vaguely recalled a machine of some kind, and a 
<br />
tall, artificial person who he knew he should know, but had forgotten for 
<br />
some reason.  He remembered the words, &quot;See you in infinity&quot;.  Was that 
<br />
where he was?  Was this what infinity looked like?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he thought, more questoins seemed to pile up.  Questions that 
<br />
he didn't have answers for.  For one of the few times in his life, Sonic 
<br />
the Hedgehog became frightened.  He didn't know where he was or why he 
<br />
was there, he couldn't see, he couldn't move, he couldn't hear . . . or 
<br />
could he?  Sonic could barely make out a soft, distant humming sound 
<br />
which seemed to rise in volume and then fade again at irregular times.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, Sonic continued to float aimlessly through a dark, 
<br />
sightless void with his own thoughts, and a distand hum as his only 
<br />
companions.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words &quot;Procedure Successful&quot; continued to flash on the 
<br />
control screen.  Packbell stood behind his control panel staring at the 
<br />
words for what seemed an eternity before turning to the Swat-bot holding 
<br />
Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Would you take the prisoner and wait outside,&quot; he said &quot;I'll 
<br />
send for you in a minute.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Bunnie had been removed, Packbell turned back to the screen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot; he cried out as he began dancing in 
<br />
happiness.  After all that work and all those failures, his machine 
<br />
finally worked.  It was several minutes before he was able to calm himself.
<br />
He called the Swat-bot back in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Computer, what is the status of the body?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Body is being maintained on full life support.  All systems normal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What did you do to him, Packbell!&quot; demanded Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The same thing I'm going to do to you my dear,&quot; replied Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The table holding Sonic slid silently out of the way as another 
<br />
table came up from the floor under the laser scanners.  The Swat-bot took 
<br />
Bunnie over to it where it strapped her down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You see, my dear,&quot; began Packbell &quot;The one thing I've always 
<br />
admired about Robotnik is his ability to make people suffer.  The 
<br />
robotizizer is, in my experience, one of the best devices in existence 
<br />
for causing such suffering.  Not only does it turn the victim's life into 
<br />
a living nightmare, but it also provides free slave labor.  However, it 
<br />
has it's flaws.  The person's senses are maintained so that they are 
<br />
aware of what's going on.  I've recently become aware that, because of 
<br />
this, worker-bots have the capability to break their spell of submission.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie froze for a moment, hoping he wassn't refering to Uncle Chuck.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fortunately, I have yet to hear of such a thing.  You see, the 
<br />
purpose of this machine is to upload a person's mind into the computer, 
<br />
leaving their body to be robotizized and given the neccessary progamming 
<br />
for it to function.  The person, however is stored in the computer which 
<br />
is a living nightmare in itself since I or anyone else can toy with them, 
<br />
torture them or erase them.  Therefore, we have the same purpose of a 
<br />
robotizizer, but this eliminates the possiblity of worker-bots turning on 
<br />
us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie stared at Packbell as he told his tale of horror.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'll never get away with this,&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You keep saying that,&quot; Packbell said as he walked behind the 
<br />
control panel &quot;Sometimes I think that's the freedom fighters motto.  Oh 
<br />
well.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell flipped the switch and the process began again.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in Knothole, Sally was getting worried.  Sonic and Bunnie 
<br />
were supposed to have reported back hours before and they didn't.  A trip 
<br />
to Bookshire's house proved fruitless as he was unable to locate any 
<br />
records of their capture.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where could they possibly be!&quot; complained Sally as she stood in 
<br />
Bookshire's computer room &quot;It's not like them to not come back.  Are you 
<br />
sure there isn't anything on them on the computer, Book?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I looked at every prisoner info file that my software could 
<br />
access, but they weren't mentioned anywhere.  Chances are, the ywere 
<br />
captured, but somebody didn't make a record of it,&quot; Bookshire responded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now what reason would anyone have for not making a record?&quot; 
<br />
asked Sally.  Before she even finished talking, she remembered why they 
<br />
were there in the first place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If Packbell captured them, they could be in serious trouble!&quot; 
<br />
she exclaimed &quot;I'm taking Dulcy, Rotor and the others to get them out.  
<br />
If you find out what's going on, contact us on the secured channel.&quot;?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire nodded, knowing it was the only choice at the moment 
<br />
&quot;You have my word, your highness.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell walked back to the research center looking extremely 
<br />
pleased with himself.  Not only had he gotten his machine to work, but 
<br />
there was nothing he loved more than seeing Robotnik yelling at Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it was work time again and he had two things he needed 
<br />
to take care of, and he meant to do so by the end of the day.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning to the experimentaion chamber, he paused briefly by the 
<br />
lifless bodies of Sonic and Bunnie which were only being kept functioning 
<br />
buy artificial means.  He'd have them robotizized eventually, but now, it 
<br />
was time for some fun.  Sitting behind the control panel, he turned on 
<br />
the computer links and the moniters as he accessed two files that had 
<br />
been displayed. . .
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had floated endlessly in the darkness.  All he had been 
<br />
able to listen to was the soft hum.  Suddenly, without warning, the hum 
<br />
increased to a loud roar for a split second as blinding light flased 
<br />
before his eyes for an instant.  The next thing he knew, he was lying on 
<br />
his back on some cold surface staring up at an endless sky.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had a pounding headache.  He lay there for a few moments 
<br />
wishing it would go away when he heard a slight groan of to his right.  
<br />
Sitting up and turning his head slightly he saw Bunnie lying on her back, 
<br />
also with what appeared to be a pounding headache.  What made Sonic 
<br />
almost jump with surprise, however, was the fact that Bunnie didn't 
<br />
appear to be robotizized.  Gone completely were the metallic legs and arm 
<br />
that had plagued Bunnie's existence for years.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was at her side in a second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, you okay?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie groaned for a second, holding her hand to her head.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ohh, ya'll tell the guy with the jackhammer to layoff, would 
<br />
ya'&quot; she mumbled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on, Bunnie, snap out of it,&quot; Sonic urged gently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie opened her eyes and slowly sat up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where are we?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know,&quot; Sonic relied.  He wished he could tell her more, 
<br />
but he really didn't know what else to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly saw that she was no longer robotizized.  For several 
<br />
moments she was speechless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;oh my stars!&quot; she declared.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know,&quot; Sonic said &quot;I really wish I knew what was happening.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bunnie didn't seem to hear him.	
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's...it's like I was never robotizized,&quot; she said, testing her 
<br />
limbs carefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You never were,&quot; a chilling voice said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie and sonic looked up suddenly.  Up in the sky a large 
<br />
screen had appeared an Packbell had appeared in it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The person known as Bunnie Rabbot was NEVER robotizized,&quot; 
<br />
Packbell continued &quot;Only her body was.  Her conciousness is not effected 
<br />
by physical trauma.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell!&quot; shouted sonic in anger &quot;You've got ten seconds to 
<br />
tell me what's going on or I'll rip you apart!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, what looked like liquid metal sprang out of the ground 
<br />
and wrapped itself around Sonic, virtually tying him to the ground in an 
<br />
unbreakable restraint.  Packbell smirked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're in my world now and in no position to make demands,&quot; he 
<br />
stated &quot;Here, everything is in my control...even you.  If I wanted to I 
<br />
could erase you from existence in a second...but I won't.  I'd ratehr 
<br />
have some fun with you first.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell grinned...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire had been up most of the night trying to figure out what 
<br />
was going on, but he had absoluetly no luck.  He now sat befor his 
<br />
computer, trying to think of where he had not looked.  Long before, he 
<br />
had given up looking in the logical places and now he was looking where 
<br />
ever he could.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He took a sip from his cup of coffee as he watched the various 
<br />
pieces of information scroll by.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, he stopped.  In front of him was an entry for an energy 
<br />
requizition to the Research Center requested by Cmdr. Packbell.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes!!&quot; bookshire exclaimed.  He quickly accessed the the 
<br />
Research Center Files and came across a secured file regarding Packbell's 
<br />
research.  Fortunately, Packbell seemed to have forgotten to code lock it 
<br />
so reading it would be no problem.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat silently as he accessed the file information and read 
<br />
through the details of Packbell's horrible assignment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After he had read through half of it, he decided to get into the 
<br />
support files section and see what was there.  As the filenames scrolled 
<br />
by, two names caught his eye:
<br />

<br />
sonic.con           158MB   Status:  ACTIVE
<br />
bunnie.con          146MB   Status:  ACTIVE
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He sat there looking at the names for a moment.  The horrible 
<br />
reality suddenly dawned on him that they must have been successfully 
<br />
uploaded.  Not wasting a moment, he quickly began to search for a way to 
<br />
reverse the proccess while he alerted Sally's strike team in Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in Robotropolis, Sally, and Rotor, sat hiding behind a 
<br />
garbage dumpster outside the research Center while Ducly stood up on top 
<br />
of a nearby building acting as a lookout.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor crouched by Sally as they listened to Bookshire's 
<br />
information on Sally's com-link.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...and the lab they're in is on the third sub-level,&quot; Bookshire 
<br />
finished.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But, how are we going to get in there?&quot; Rotor asked, peeking out 
<br />
from behind the dumpster &quot;The place is surrounded by SWAT-bots.  We go in 
<br />
there and we'll be captured for sure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm working on it,&quot; Bookshire responded &quot;I'm trying to see if I 
<br />
can send them a false order and get them to leave...stand by...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire's fingers flew across his keyboard as he issued various 
<br />
vocal commands to his system.  After a moment, he was able to access the 
<br />
area of the system for issuing orders, and commanded the SWAT-bot's to 
<br />
surround and guard one of the distant factories.  He sat back and waited 
<br />
for a sign that it had worked.  Suddenly, the com-link crackled to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It worked, Book,&quot; said Sally &quot;The bots are moving away, and 
<br />
we're going in...Dulcy, keep guard up there, we'll call you when we need 
<br />
you...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You got it, sally&quot; said Dulcy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...and Book, stay on the line in case we need you,&quot; finished Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll be here,&quot; responded Bookshire.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He returned to his computer, hacking his way back into the 
<br />
Research Center files as he waited for sally's command.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and rotor watched carefully as the bots dispersed.  As soon 
<br />
as it was clear, they ran for the door.  It was locked, but was quickly 
<br />
unlocked thanks to some quick tinkering on the part of Rotor.  Sneaking 
<br />
into the building, they quietly made their way downstairs.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lab was silent as Sally and Rotor quietly entered.  Against 
<br />
the far wall, they could see the bodies of Sonic and Bunnie still  being 
<br />
held on life support.  The ystopped for a moment as the noticed Packbell 
<br />
sitting at the controls, but it seemed as though he was unaware of their 
<br />
presence.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two cautiously approached Packbell.  He was sitting in his 
<br />
chair behind the console, his eyes closed and his left hand pressed into 
<br />
some kind of direct interface.  Sally backed away a bit and whispered 
<br />
into her com-link.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're in, bookshire,&quot; she said &quot;Packbell's behind the console, 
<br />
but I don't think he notices us.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, hang on,&quot; came the reply &quot;I'm trying to access the 
<br />
experiment controls.  It might take awhile so jsut sit tight.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Affirmative, we'll be waitng,&quot; Sally replied.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deep inside the system,  Packbell's construct grinned as he paced 
<br />
thoughtfully around his two prisioners, both held to the ground by the 
<br />
strange silver metal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You know,&quot; he said &quot;I've always dreamed of what I'd do when I 
<br />
got my hands on you.  The problem is, I have so many ways to kill you, 
<br />
but you can only die once...decisions, decisions...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic glared at Packbell defiantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So this is how you're going to kill us?&quot; he responded &quot;By boring 
<br />
us to death with speeches?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell grinned &quot;True, I could do that.  Honestly, I could, and 
<br />
yet...that wouldn't be much fun.  Oh, I know!  Maybe I'll have you erased 
<br />
from the system, byte by painful byte...and I'd make sure it hurt! ;)&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Sonic's and Bunnie's images flickered for a moment.  
<br />
Packbell frowned suddenly and looked up in the sky.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie looked at Sonic nervously as they flickered again &quot;What's 
<br />
happening to us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't know,&quot; he replied.  Suddenly, Packbell's eyes opened wide.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The link!!  Someone's got control of the System!!&quot; he screamed, 
<br />
vanishing in a flash of light.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's construct reappared inside a communications node.  he 
<br />
quickly identifed the intruding link and jammed it.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire stopped a moment as he saw his link to Packbell's sytem 
<br />
wavering.  He thought for a moment and grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, Packbell,&quot; he said to himself &quot;You're not stopping me 
<br />
that easy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's attention flew suddenly to a bypass link on another node.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Not so fast, Freedom Fighter!&quot; he exclaimed.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire saw the words flash across the screen and thought for a 
<br />
moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Granted...maybe not as fast as Sonic,&quot; he said as he began 
<br />
typing into his system &quot;but a heck of a lot faster than you.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly, Packbell noticed connections coming in from over 100 
<br />
different locations.  He quickly moved, dividing himself down to cover 
<br />
the links and prevent access to his control system.  He laughed defiantly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Create as many links as you want, Freedom Fighter!  I'll block 
<br />
them all!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire grinned.  Packbell had fallen for it.  He calming 
<br />
pulled a disk out his top drawer and slid it into his computer.  He 
<br />
activated the program stored on it and paused it a moment.  He quickly 
<br />
typed in commands, sending instructions to the global nodes he used to 
<br />
open 1000 more connections.  he knew Packbell would block them all, but, 
<br />
the more he blocked, the more weak and spread out he became.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, divided himself down again as the connections kept 
<br />
coming in, his conciousness flying from node to node blocking the 
<br />
connections, completely oblivious to the trap he was falling into.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire grinned a little as he activated the program.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;bye, bye,&quot; he said quietly.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell paused in a node as he blocked the connections.  
<br />
Suddenly, he saw something flying towards him.  Too late, he realized it 
<br />
was a copy of the 'Black Death' computer virus.  He tried to pull himself 
<br />
back together, but the virus slammed right into him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and rotor had been waiting patiently for info from 
<br />
Bookshire.  Suddenly, the console Packbell was sitting at exploded, 
<br />
flinging the android back into the wall.  Sally and Rotor jumped in 
<br />
suprise at the explosion and dove for cover.  suddenly, rotor noticed 
<br />
that the laser system activated and began scanning Sonic and Bunnie's 
<br />
bodies.  Sally's com-link crackled to life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm in...I've begun the download process,&quot; came Bookshire's 
<br />
voice &quot;As soon as its complete,get them out of there, I've infected the 
<br />
system and it's going to blow!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Acknowleged,&quot;  Sally replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran over to the bodies as Sonic and Bunnie were downloaded 
<br />
back into them.  sally glanced over at where Packbell laid.  It was quite 
<br />
obvious that he wasn't even functioning.  As soon as the download 
<br />
proccess was completed, Sally and Rotor each grabbed an unconcious body 
<br />
and ran from the room as equipment began exploding around them.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They ran out of the building where they were prmptly retrieved by 
<br />
Ducly.  as they flew off into the air, they heard the huge boom as the 
<br />
Robotropolis Research Center went up in flames, taking Packbell with it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally watched the destruction solumnly as she held Sonic in her 
<br />
arms, finding it hard to believe that one of the many threats to freedom on 
<br />
Mobius was actually dead.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Bunnie awoke a few hours after returning to Knothole.  
<br />
After looking them both over, Bookshire reported that they'd both be fine.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few nights later, Sonic and Sally were sitting by a thick log 
<br />
in the forest, gazing up at the stars.  Sonic sighed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally smiled &quot;What's the matter?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, sal, this worlds now a little more boring than it used to 
<br />
be.  Packbell was a major challenge and now he's gone.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You can't have possibly liked it when he was around,&quot; Sally replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, in a way I did.  Sal, I gotta have action, I gotta have 
<br />
adventure!  Now there's only Robotnik left to give it to me.  sometimes I 
<br />
wonder what I'd do if and when we finally beat him,&quot; Sonic replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally turned to him, smiling.  Sonic knew she only smiled like 
<br />
that when they were alone by this log.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I'm sure we'll be able to find things for you to do,&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic grinned and wrapped his arms around her, hugging her gently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, probably...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He leaned forward and kissed her deeply.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the two laid there until late into the night, talking and 
<br />
kissing...and kissing.
<br />

<br />
THE END...or is it...
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Epilogue:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lone shuttle flew silently through the early morning darkness.  
<br />
In the pilot's seat, a lone figure sat quietly.  He had a metallic skin 
<br />
and an evil glint in his eye.  deep within his mind was nothing but 
<br />
hatred and rage.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one kills me, he thought quietly, no one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He scanners beeped suddenly, indicating he was just coming up on 
<br />
robotropolis.  The shuttle began it's approah as it's pilot began 
<br />
thinking of ways to vent his anger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There IS a whole block full of prisoners, isn't there, he thought 
<br />
as the shuttle landed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got out of the shuttle and left the bay, heading towards the 
<br />
prision block...Packbell was back.
<br />
