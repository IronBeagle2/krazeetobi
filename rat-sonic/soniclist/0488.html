AUTHOR'S NOTE:  I would like to take this opportunity to thank Morgan for
<br />
his assistance is writing one of the scenes in this story.  Its
<br />
appreciated. 
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cold chill of Winter was slowly passing and being replaced by
<br />
the damp warmth of Spring.  All throughout the Great Forest, signs of the
<br />
season could be seen everywhere.  In the heart of the forest, at Knothole
<br />
Village, the freedom fighters welcomed t he Spring after a harsh, cold
<br />
winter.  Now that the winter was over, activity would increase.  One of
<br />
the activities being engaged in on this particular day, was the testing of
<br />
one of Rotor's new inventions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A line of targets had been set up and were waiting.  Without
<br />
warning, a metallic fist shot through one of them with amazing force. 
<br />
Twenty-five yards away, Rotor watched and took notes as Bunnie used her
<br />
extendable left arm to destroy each target in turn.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How's it feel?&quot; asked Rotor as Bunnie pulled her robotic arm back
<br />
to its normal length.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Smooth as glass, sugar,&quot; said Bunnie, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Great,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;There's just one more thing.  May I?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor gestured to Bunnie's arm which she lifted to him.  Rotor
<br />
opened a side panel and did some more tinkering.  As he worked, Bunnie
<br />
felt something click inside her arm.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, what was that?&quot; she asked.	
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just a locking system,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;We wouldn't want you
<br />
driving that fist into anything by accident would we.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No we wouldn't,&quot; Bunnie agreed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Now that we finally perfected this, you'll be able to bulls-eye
<br />
Swat-bots right between the eyes at twenty-five yards,&quot; said Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd rather bulls-eye Robotnik, but I get your point,&quot; Bunnie responded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I know what you mean,&quot; Rotor said, chuckling briefly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a moment of silence between the two.  Rotor hated
<br />
moments like this when words escaped him.  He looked into Bunnie's eyes as
<br />
he fought for his voice.  There was something welling up in his heart that
<br />
he wanted to say, but he couldn't bring himself to say it.  He shook the
<br />
thought from his mind as he found his voice.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I guess that just about does it,&quot; he said hastily, gathering
<br />
up his notes &quot;If you have any problems with it let me know.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie looked at him consideringly for a moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alright, sugar,&quot; she replied &quot;you can count on it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she walked back to her hut, Bunnie thought about what had
<br />
happened.  She had seen the look of uncertainty on Rotor's face.  She saw
<br />
the nervousness in his eyes.  She often wondered what it was that made
<br />
Rotor seem so uncertain of himself.  Even more t han that, she wondered
<br />
why her heart was always racing during those times when Rotor struggled
<br />
for words.  It was as if, during moments like that, she would kill just to
<br />
find out what he really wanted to say.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later that night, after Bunnie crawled into bed, she lay awake for
<br />
several minutes thinking about Rotor.  She thought of how good he was at
<br />
the things he does, and about how he seemed to want to devote so much time
<br />
to her.  As she fell asleep that night, Rotor was the last thought on her mind.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie fell out of bed and lay stunned for a minute, not quite awake
<br />
yet.  When she did come fully conscious, she found to her dismay that her
<br />
right leg was paralyzed. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my stars,&quot; Bunnie gasped, her heart skipping a beat.  &quot;Oh no! 
<br />
What will I do?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not letting herself get worked up into hysterics, she steeled herself
<br />
and grasped the footboard of the bed.  Her robotic arm was more that
<br />
strong enough to pull her body upright. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There, Bunniegirl!&quot; she said to herself, &quot;No reason to worry none. 
<br />
All you got to do now is to get yourself over to Rotor's.  I hope the
<br />
sugar-rus won't mind me knocking at this time of the night...&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was three in the morning when Rotor sat back from the story he'd
<br />
been writing.  He rubbed his eyes and yawned, then saved his file and shut
<br />
down his computer. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got yourself sucked in again,&quot; he chuckled to himself as he walked
<br />
over to the sink for a glass of water. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He turned at the knock at the door.  Taking the water with him, he
<br />
went to answer it. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie!&quot; he said, glad to see her.  Then he noticed something was
<br />
wrong. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm so sorry to wake you, darlin',&quot; Bunnie said, shifting her
<br />
weight.  &quot;But I need your help.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure,&quot; Rotor said, motioning her to enter.  &quot;What's wrong?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My right leg's frozen, sugar,&quot; Bunnie said, her courage beginning
<br />
to crack. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh,&quot; Rotor gasped, setting down the glass aside on the dresser
<br />
beside the door. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Come on,&quot; he added, helping Bunnie inside.  &quot;I'll take care of you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor lifted Bunnie up and sat her on his worktable, which was high
<br />
enough to let him work on the leg comfortably.  He brought over his
<br />
scanner and his tool box and set up to work. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm awfully grateful to you, sugar,&quot; Bunnie said, trying to be
<br />
chipper.  But it was clear she was frightened. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't worry, Bunnie,&quot; Rotor said, pausing to look into her eyes and
<br />
place an assuring hand on her furry shoulder.  &quot;You're gonna be fine.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie smiled, happy the walrus was so understanding.  She sat
<br />
patiently as he worked, admiring his confidence and seeing that he
<br />
actually enjoyed his work.  Soon he was finished. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't try to move it yet,&quot; he said, putting away his tools.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Give it a few minutes to warm up.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What happened?&quot; Bunnie asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Old cable snapped lose, is all,&quot; Rotor explained.  &quot;Did you fall,
<br />
or eh, pull a muscle?&quot; he added with a chuckle. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I did fall out of bed!&quot; Bunnie giggled, feeling so relived and happy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor sighed.  He loved to hear Bunnie laugh.  He loved to hear her
<br />
talk, period.  He moved to speak to her, but words failed him now, and a
<br />
fear of sounding foolish or forward cooled his amorous drive altogether. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie could see the change in Rotor's face she knew so well. 
<br />
Placing her hand to her heart, she recalled how often Rotor would seem so
<br />
happy and peaceful, but suddenly go dark and silent.  Oh, how it bothered
<br />
her! 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong, darlin'?! she asked, putting her hand on Rotor's
<br />
shoulder. &quot;Why so sad all of a sudden?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I dunno,&quot; Rotor sighed, leaning against the table.  He put his
<br />
hand on Bunnie's hard metallic thigh, appearing to examine it, but his
<br />
then touch softened and he slipped his hand up to Bunnie's yielding waist. 
<br />
He swallowed as the warmth of the rabbit's body passed into his palm. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it, sugar?&quot; Bunnie asked again, her heart quickening at his
<br />
touch. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor took a deep breath and looked straight into Bunnie's eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's just that I...&quot; he began again, then hesitated.  Shaking his
<br />
head he grunted with frustration. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, darlin'?&quot; Bunnie coaxed him, her eyes soft and receptive.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I like you a whole lot,&quot; Rotor finally said.  &quot;And I think I love you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Rotor,&quot; Bunnie sighed.  A tear fell from her eye.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor shivered and stepped back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I'm sorry,&quot; he gasped, becoming agitated.  &quot;I'm so sorry.  I
<br />
shocked you.  I shouldn't have said it.  I'm sorry.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; Bunnie gasped, trying to slip off the table.  &quot;No,&quot; darlin'! 
<br />
You're all right!&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't move!&quot; Rotor warned, pushing his body against hers to prevent
<br />
the rabbit from hitting the floor and undoing the surgery. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, Rotor,&quot; Bunnie said, bringing him closer into an embrace.  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You sweet thing!&quot;  She choked, trying not to cry. Yet knowing now
<br />
how Rotor felt about her was overwhelming. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie,&quot; Rotor gasped, afraid of what was happening to them.  It
<br />
was wrong to start it this way, he scolded himself.  She's too
<br />
vulnerable...  She can't think...  I can't think! 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He stood helpless for a few moments, holding Bunnie as she cried
<br />
against his chest. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You needn't be afraid,&quot; Bunnie sobbed.  &quot;You darlin'...!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm afraid I've upset you,&quot; Rotor said, rocking the rabbit gently.
<br />
&quot;I shouldn't have told you this way.  You're tired and scared...  It just
<br />
isn't right...&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not afraid anymore!&quot; Bunnie said, now incredibly happy.  &quot;Not
<br />
when I'm here with you.&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor drew back from the embrace and bent to examine Bunnie's leg.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Try to move it now.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie found that her leg moved easily.  Rotor lifted her up and
<br />
placed her gently to the floor upon her feet.  Bunnie walked around the
<br />
room a few times.  Satisfied that her leg was good as new, she approached
<br />
Rotor and moved to hold him again. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Rotor held Bunnie back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I think you'd better go,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay,&quot; Bunnie said, confused but cooperative.  &quot;If you want me to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor walked her to the door but did not open it.  He stood for a
<br />
moment, searching his mind for something else to say that would explain
<br />
his behavior, but found nothing.  He felt terrible. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was not the way he wanted it to happen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At his pause Bunnie took the opportunity to embrace Rotor again and
<br />
give him a loving kiss on the mouth, not too passionate, but strong enough
<br />
to let the walrus understand that everything was all right and that the
<br />
love between them was mutual. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks Rotor,&quot; Bunnie said.  &quot;Good night.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good night,&quot; Rotor said, opening the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie paused on the porch and looked back at Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me know how that leg is, Bunnie,&quot; Rotor said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course, sugar,&quot; Bunnie said softly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor nodded goodbye and closed the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie watched the lights go out in Rotor's hut.  Letting out a
<br />
heavy sigh, she went back to her hut, knowing she would not sleep that
<br />
night for thinking of her friend. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the hut, Rotor climbed into bed and tried to go to sleep.  He
<br />
rolled over and pulled the covers over his head. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You did it all wrong,&quot; he scolded himself.  &quot;ALL wrong!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, Rotor sat miserably at his table as he munched on
<br />
a sweet roll.  He didn't think it was possible for him to feel any worse. 
<br />
Last night had been a total disaster as far as he was concerned.  He had
<br />
been waiting for the perfect moment to t ell Bunnie how he felt, and last
<br />
night wasn't it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the truth was out now.  Bunnie knew exactly how Rotor
<br />
felt about her.  He wondered briefly if he'd ever be able to look at
<br />
Bunnie again without feeling guilty about how he had taken advantage of
<br />
her vulnerability the night before.  How would he deal with all that had
<br />
happened?  It was clear that he needed advice, but who to go to?  Antoine
<br />
considered himself to be creation's gift to females, and Bookshire, for
<br />
all his life experience, had never been in love, at least not to anyone's
<br />
knowledge.  Sonic was the only one left.  He was in a deep relationship
<br />
with Sally, so he seemed to be the perfect person to go to.  After he
<br />
finished breakfast, Rotor went out to find him, hoping he wouldn't run
<br />
into Bunnie along the way. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie rolled over in bed.  As predicted, she had not slept a wink
<br />
since 3:00 am.  Since the moment she got back from seeing Rotor, he was
<br />
all she could think of.  The idea that he loved her was not entirely new
<br />
to her.  There had been several times in t he past when she suspected that
<br />
that's what it was, but she had never explored the possibility.  Now it
<br />
was all out in the open.  Rotor loved her.  That's why he wanted to spend
<br />
time with her and be close to her.  It was also why he would suddenly
<br />
become silent and distant when words failed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing that confused her most was that, after he told her,
<br />
he seemed to collapse in on himself and regret that he had said anything. 
<br />
When she had wanted to embrace him, he wanted her to leave.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As she slipped out of her nightgown and got dressed, she thought
<br />
of how their relationship had started.  From the very first day she was
<br />
robotizized, he had been there for her.  During the times when she was
<br />
frustrated because she couldn't get her legs t o work properly or the
<br />
times when she would accidently crush something in her robotic hand, he
<br />
had been there to pick her up and encourage her to keep trying.  She
<br />
remembered how happy she had been the day she was able to shake Rotor's
<br />
hand with no fear o f crushing it into a bloody mess.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When she finished dressing, she went out to find Sally.  She needed 
<br />
advice and she needed it now.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rotor walked down by the power ring pool, he heard a sonic boom as 
<br />
Sonic raced up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hiya, Rote,&quot; said Sonic &quot;How are ya'&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, am I glad to see you, &quot; said Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What is it?&quot; asked Sonic, somewhat more seriously.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I need advice,&quot; replied Rotor &quot;I've got a major problem.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tell me about it,&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, it's about Bunnie . . .I'm in love with her, Sonic,&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Alright!&quot; exclaimed Sonic &quot;Congratulations!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Sonic saw Rotor didn't share his excitement, he calmed down.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Last night she came to me because she was having a problem with
<br />
her leg, &quot;Rotor said &quot;She was scared.  After I fixed her leg, I told her
<br />
how I felt.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So?  I don't get what your problem is,&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It was the wrong time!&quot; exclaimed Rotor &quot;She was tired and scared
<br />
and I took advantage of her and her feelings.  Now, I've gone and ruined
<br />
the whole thing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, what makes you think it was the wrong time?&quot; asked Sonic
<br />
&quot;How did she react when you told her?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well . . .she seemed shocked at first, then she started crying. 
<br />
Whether it was from shock or happiness, I'm not sure,&quot; replied Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look Rote, if she didn't flatly refuse you, I'd say that was a
<br />
pretty good sign she was happy,&quot; said Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, she did kiss me before she left,&quot; admitted Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There you go,&quot; said Sonic smiling &quot;That just proves my point.  It
<br />
may not have been the situation you were planning on telling her in, but
<br />
she doesn't seem to care.  The point is she's glad you told her at all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, what do I do now?&quot; asked Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well,&quot; Sonic thought for a moment &quot;Do something romantic for her.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Like what?&quot; asked Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, sometimes Sally and I arrange late-night encounters in the
<br />
garden.  We talk and look at the stars.  We sometimes end up in some of
<br />
the most passionate kissing sessions you ever heard of,&quot; said Sonic,
<br />
chuckling briefly &quot;Obviously, you and Bunnie just started in your
<br />
relationship so you wouldn't be that deep yet, but I think you see where
<br />
I'm going with this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, I think so,&quot; said Rotor &quot;Thanks for the advice.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No prob,&quot; said Sonic cheerfully &quot;That's one of the many reasons
<br />
I'm here.  Good luck!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic powered up and raced off into the distance.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He's so uncertain at times, it's almost nerve-racking,&quot; Bunnie was
<br />
saying &quot;Now that he's told me how he feels, he seems even worse.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie and Sally sat in Sally's hut talking about the events of
<br />
the previous night.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, Rotor's a shy person,&quot; said Sally &quot;You just need to give him
<br />
some time to come to terms with his feelings.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The problem is I don't think he intended to tell me under
<br />
conditions like those,&quot; said Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Admissions of love are rarely planned out,&quot; said Sally &quot;He's
<br />
probably just in shock by the fact that he told you during a time that he
<br />
thought was inappropriate.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, how do I help him come around?&quot; asked Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's very hard to do.  Usually its better to wait a while to see
<br />
if he come out of it by himself,&quot; Sally said &quot;Julayla used to say 'Time
<br />
heals all wounds'.  Just be patient.  You love him and you know he loves
<br />
you, all it needs is time.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few days later, Rotor paced back and forth in his hut trying to
<br />
decide how to get Bunnie to meet him that night.  He had decided to set up
<br />
a romantic encounter in the garden, but setting it up was harder than he
<br />
thought.  With Sonic's help he had managed to gather the appropriate
<br />
materials, now all he had to do was ask Bunnie to meet him.  He wasn't
<br />
quite ready to go up and ask her directly, he wanted to do it another way. 
<br />
Suddenly, he snapped his fingers as he got an idea. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over in Bunnie's hut, Bunnie sat by the window thinking about the
<br />
things she and Sally had talked about.  Suddenly, she heard a noise over
<br />
by here front door.  Going over to investigate, she found a small piece of
<br />
paper on the floor that someone must hav e slipped under her door. 
<br />
Unfolding it, she noted the wonderful handwriting style as she read it: 
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dearest love:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My feelings for you run deep and I can't be without you.  I would
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like to ask you to meet me in the garden tonight around Nine o'clock so
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that we may discuss the feelings we have for one another. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Love,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie almost cried out in joy as she finished reading.  He heart
<br />
sang as she went over to her wardrobe and decided what to wear.  Tonight
<br />
would not be a night she would soon forget. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That night as the clock move slowly toward nine, Rotor waited
<br />
nervously.  Next to him on a table he had set up was a CD player with a
<br />
disc of slow, romantic music in it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he turned toward the garden entrance, the site that met his
<br />
eyes took his breath away.  Bunnie was standing at the entrance smiling at
<br />
him.  Instead of the normal purple garb she usually wore, she was decked
<br />
out in a stunning purple dress that was of such beauty that it must have
<br />
been something she had been saving for a special occasion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good evening, Rotor&quot; she said softly as she walked up to him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor's voice caught in his throat for a moment before he found it
<br />
again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good evening,&quot; he said &quot;You look real nice, Bunnie.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thanks,&quot; said Bunnie, smiling.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor hesitated another moment as he looked deep into her eyes. 
<br />
They were so beautiful, Rotor thought, she was so beautiful.  The feeling
<br />
of love were welling up inside him like never before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie,&quot; he began &quot;about the other night . . .&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shhh,&quot; Bunnie said soothingly &quot;I understand, sugar.  You were
<br />
nervous and afraid.  It's okay.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's just that I love you so much, I didn't want to hurt you,&quot;
<br />
said Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You didn't hurt me,&quot; said Bunnie &quot;You told me what was in your
<br />
heart.  You let your feelings out into the open.  To be honest, I'm glad
<br />
you did.  I love you too, Rotor&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor couldn't think of a response to that, but he didn't need to. 
<br />
Bunnie leaned forward and they embraced in a kiss more passionate than the
<br />
one of a few days ago.  They stayed like that for what seemed to be an 
<br />
eternity before pulling back.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mmm, that was nice,&quot; said Bunnie &quot;You ever kiss a girl before?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No,&quot; admitted Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, in that case, I'm impressed,&quot; Bunnie said, the smile never
<br />
leaving her face.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they released, Bunnie glanced over and saw the CD player.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's that for?&quot; she asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I thought that maybe we could . . . well, you know, perhaps we
<br />
could . . .dance?&quot; he said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'd love to,&quot; replied Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor walked over and turned on the music.  It was slow and
<br />
beautiful.  Returning to Bunnie, he took her in his arms and they began to
<br />
dance slowly around the garden.  Never for a moment did they take their
<br />
eyes off each other.  They simply gazed lovingly at each other as if in a
<br />
trance while their legs moved them about in perfect rhythm. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally were walking down the path by the garden when they
<br />
heard the soft music.  Pausing by the garden entrance, they observed the
<br />
two lovers dancing in the moonlight.  Sonic smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Looks like my advice paid off,&quot; he whispered to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How do you know it wasn't my advice that helped,&quot; Sally asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The hedgehog knows,&quot; he whispered boastfully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh really,&quot; said Sally &quot;Well, why don't we leave these two alone
<br />
and discuss the matter in private.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sounds good to me.  Lead the way,&quot; replied Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally quietly slipped away as Rotor and Bunnie continued to 
<br />
dance.  As they did, they both realized in their hearts that they would be 
<br />
together forever.  They would never leave each other side and they would love 
<br />
each other always.  The feeling between them were now too strong to break.  
<br />
They knew they would remember this day for the rest of their lives.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A wise person once said:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A day needs not a name to be made special,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor does it need a victorious battle,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor a brutal slaughter,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All it needs is the true love of two people.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For Bunnie and Rotor, as they danced the night way under the stars, 
<br />
there was nothing truer than that.
<br />

<br />
THE END
<br />
