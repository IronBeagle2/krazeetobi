<br />
Who says evil would be kicked out. What about Snively? And even
<br />
after Snively, you have thousands of swat bots to deal with (sort
<br />
of like a &quot;Terminator&quot; theme), and maybe, some of the survivors (or
<br />
someone period) would take the opportunity to take Mobius while
<br />
it's in it's weak stages of rebuilding. Besides, I HATE endings.
<br />
Whenever a good story ends, I always feel like I want more (anyone
<br />
agree?). That's why a part of me is glad that the third season
<br />
didn't go in effect (so call me a rebel). The 3rd season not being
<br />
made forced a lot of the good writers to make stories of possible
<br />
outcomes of the Mobius. (P.S. give credit to Archie for not coming
<br />
even close to a conclusion).

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;    And last, Snivley, would he be a better Robotnik???
</em><br />

<br />
In my opinion, no. Robotnik was responsible for taking over the
<br />
planet, building the roboticiser, designing war plans, etc.
<br />
Snively was only a lackey. True, he did notice Robotnik's mistakes,
<br />
but Robotnik was under &quot;hedgehog&quot; stress all the time, so maybe he
<br />
couldn't think straight. Snively would be under the same stress
<br />
when he comes to power. Also, Robotnik looks to me to be more
<br />
clever
<br />
than Snively. &quot;Spyhog&quot; gave a lot of credit to Robotnik in that
<br />
when Snively wanted to destroy the spy bug, Robotnik told him to
<br />
rip out a diode, and put it back. This way, when the spy comes to
<br />
replace it, they will be able to catch him (that was to make sure
<br />
whoever didn't see the episodes, wasn't in the dark).

HI VIXIE! Believe me, If you like Sonic, you'll feel right at home.

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;My opinion of Archie is they're publishing the almost-mythical

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;story of the War about a thousand years after the event, and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;lot of details were confused when the story was passed down to

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;each generation after the next.. (For an example, when they

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;started they thought Sally was /pink/!  It was only after that

<em class="quotelev1">&gt;their rent-a-scholars realized the error..)
</em><br />

<br />
In my opinion, Mobius girls and pink do not mix. I am still upset
<br />
about Archie's Bunnie Rabbot (I got my second comic, #32,
<br />
yesterday,
<br />
and Bunnie just doesn't seem to have her charm), and Amy Rose,
<br />
well, either she is rose, or I just don't approve of her very much.

anyone even living close to D.C. area?) (P.S. I just read some more

mail, and found out which type of episodes you guys are talking

about.

In D.C. area, Sat morning episoded were taken off the air about

four

month ago, and I was really hoping for at least reruns).

Well, that's the longest message I've ever written, and hopefully
<br />
will ever write (&quot;Will he SHUT UP!&quot; - your thoughts).

<br />
P.S. would it be much trouble if Erich *forwarded* all my messages

to the list, and I get the list messages from AOL? (we are poor,
<br />
and AOL is too greedy). (&quot;No really, WILL HE!?!?&quot;)
