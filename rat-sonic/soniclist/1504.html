<br />#28 [Nov 1995]
<br />
&quot;Saturday Noght's Alright For A Fight&quot; [3 parts]
<br />
Story: Ken Penders/Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having penetrated into the Knothole control center, Sonic
<br />
basically begins beating up on everyone in sight.  This includes
<br />
the ladies--he puts Sally in a headlock, and escapes from a leg
<br />
scissors by Bunnie.  Eventually (by the end of Part 2) Sonic is
<br />
knocked out, the bug implanted on him discovered, he recovers
<br />
from his amnesia and the plot resolved.  
<br />
Sonic Art
<br />
&quot;Growing Pains&quot;, Part 1
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher/Art: Dave Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails is still upset at Sonic for having &quot;slapped [him]
<br />
around&quot; in the previous story, and resentful of Sally for keeping
<br />
the Sea Fox in dry dock as a &quot;floating crib.&quot;  Thanks to the oil
<br />
he got from the gull in &quot;Submersible Rehearsal&quot; (the Triple
<br />
Trouble special), he sets out on his own.  Coming upon an
<br />
uncharted island, he comes to the rescue of Fiona, a captive
<br />
female fox, and instantly falls in love with her.  Fiona,
<br />
however, is an automaton set up as bait by Robotnik.  Tails is
<br />
trapped by Fiona, and Fiona herself starts the process of
<br />
roboticizing Tails [to be continued].
<br />
SonicGrams: More info about the Tails miniseries coming up --
<br />
apparently, the actions moves to &quot;Downunda,&quot; the Mobian
<br />
equivalent of Australia; Freddy Mendez has moved on to other
<br />
editorial work within Archie Comics; two letters to Sonic elicit
<br />
replies about the Tails miniseries, and elicits the information
<br />
that Sonic is 15; and one letter to Sally asks how to become a
<br />
freedom fighter (I think actually being on Mobius would be a
<br />
plus).

<br />
<br />================================================================
<br />
<br />Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 (&quot;All The
<br />
Mail's About Tails!&quot;).  Theories range from transplantation to
<br />
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
<br />
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
<br />
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
<br />
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no &quot;official&quot;
<br />
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
<br />
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
<br />
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
<br />
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
<br />
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />
<br />Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />
<br />Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />
<br />While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />
<br />Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
<br />The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />
<br />Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />
<br />At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />
<br />Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />
<br />Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
<br />
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
<br />
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
<br />
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
<br />
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
<br />
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
<br />
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
<br />
(in the comics) or of Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />
<br />Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
<br />
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
<br />
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with &quot;Deadliest of
<br />
the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
<br />
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
<br />
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
<br />
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
<br />
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
<br />
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
<br />
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
<br />
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot;
<br />
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
<br />
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
<br />
&quot;creative differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally
<br />
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
<br />
delay.
<br />
<br /><br />Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
<br />
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about &quot;The
<br />
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
<br />
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;
<br />
<br /><br /><br />Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />
like:
<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
<br />
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
<br />
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
<br />
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
<br />
of the &quot;Doomsday&quot; episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
<br />
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
<br />
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
<br />
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
<br />
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
<br />
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
<br />
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
<br />
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
<br />
you say &quot;anal retentive&quot;?).  Words were exchanged and the show
<br />
was effectively cancelled.
<br />
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
<br />
of &quot;two seasons and out&quot; for shows.  Though it's possible that
<br />
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
<br />
to begin with.
