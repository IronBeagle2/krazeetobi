<br />
Part 4.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse lay with his head resting on a fallen tree trunk, looking 
<br />
at the night sky and the stars that managed to poke through the dense 
<br />
growth of the Great Forest.  It had been three weeks since he had 
<br />
started his quest to find Knothole and the freedom fighters, and his 
<br />
luck had been minimal.  He had grown tired and weak, especially since 
<br />
food had not been foremost on his mind lately.  Now, as he stared off 
<br />
into space, a sense of futility was beginning to come over him, and he 
<br />
felt helpless.  Soon, his mind began to wander, and memories crept up...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Honey, wake up!&quot;  He felt himself being carried up and out of 
<br />
bed.  &quot;Mommy, what's wrong?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No time, baby...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Shirley!  Look ahead!&quot;  The whole world went sideways right 
<br />
after that.  He had never felt so scared in his life...he started to 
<br />
cry...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and then his mind wandered back even more...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Daddy!&quot;  Tolouse ran to his father's open arms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Careful, Tolouse!&quot; Jean said, laughing.  &quot;You'll wrinkle the 
<br />
uniform...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tears began to well in his eyes.  He had not thought of his father 
<br />
much during his time in the underground village, but now, the few 
<br />
memories that he had were coming to him vividly...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Okay, just one more button...there.  Tolouse, you look 
<br />
splendid!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jean presented his son to a mirror.  Tolouse was dressed in a 
<br />
smaller version of the Palace Guard uniform.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse beamed with pride, and his father smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You'd make a fine Palace Guard, son...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...and then, one final memory...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...&quot;Mommy, where's Daddy?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He had to work late tonight, baby.  The King is throwing a big 
<br />
party, and your father has to be there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aww.  Wish I could go to the party.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley laughed and picked her son up.  &quot;Oh, I just bet you do...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse wiped his eyes, but the tears continued to flow.  Then, his 
<br />
eyes found a star up in the night sky, a star that twinkled a little 
<br />
more brightly than its neighbors, a star that shined a little more 
<br />
stubbornly through the thick network of tree branches.  He focused on 
<br />
that star, and slowly, his determination returned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I *will* find Knothole,&quot; he told the star.  &quot;You'll see.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse then got up, ate some dinner, and found a place where he 
<br />
could sleep, safely hidden from anything overhead.  Before sleep came to 
<br />
him, his vow had been repeated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I *will* find Knothole.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next morning, Tolouse woke up to find the Mobian sun shining 
<br />
brightly through the trees.  He got up and was about to try and scrape 
<br />
together for breakfast when something moved out of the corner of his 
<br />
eye.  He turned to see.  Somebody was walking through the forest, about 
<br />
50 feet away from him!  Tolouse got up and moved quietly from tree to 
<br />
tree, trying to get a closer look.  He saw a middle aged raccoon, 
<br />
walking with a limp.  Tolouse considered calling to him, but the fear of 
<br />
the underground village had stayed with him, and he lost nerve.  He 
<br />
decided instead to follow the raccoon, hoping against hope that maybe 
<br />
the raccoon could help him find Knothole.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire had been walking through the forest for about an hour 
<br />
when he realized he was being watched.  Too many leaves had stirred 
<br />
without wind, and too many branches had moved to attribute to the usual 
<br />
forest animals.  He decided to do some backtracking and throw his 
<br />
follower off before returning to Knothole.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse sat on a small boulder, growling with frustration.  He had 
<br />
followed the raccoon for what seemed like an eternity, and then the 
<br />
animal had just disappeared.  How was he ever going to find Knothole at 
<br />
this rate?
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire went over to Sonic's hut and tapped on the door.  The 
<br />
blue hedgehog and Knothole's resident folk hero answered the door and 
<br />
said, &quot;Bookshire!  How was the walk, bud?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Listen Sonic, somebody was following me in the forest.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What?  Who?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know but I think I managed to elude whoever it was.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll check it out.  Be back in a Sonic-second!&quot;  Sonic began 
<br />
accelerating in place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a minute, Sonic, don't you think you should---&quot; but Sonic was 
<br />
already off.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bookshire sighed, completing his statement: &quot;---talk to Sally, 
<br />
first?&quot;  He shook his head and chuckled at Sonic's traditional 
<br />
impatience, and then made his way to Sally's hut.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic made several quick searches of the areas surrounding 
<br />
Knothole, and something caught his eye.  &quot;Hmm, we appear to have us 
<br />
another fox!&quot;  He homed in on this new fox's location.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was walking slowly through the forest, thinking about the 
<br />
raccoon he saw that morning, when a strange noise sounded behind him.  
<br />
He spun around and found himself face to face with a blue hedgehog.  He 
<br />
jumped, scared and dumbfounded by the hedgehog's sudden appearance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse tried to speak but couldn't find his voice, so Sonic spoke 
<br />
first.  &quot;So, bud, what brings you to this neck of the woods?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse tried to speak again, and managed to stammer, &quot;Who, who are 
<br />
you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, I'll ask the questions, bud!&quot;  But after studying the 
<br />
frightened fox, Sonic decided that his name wouldn't hurt anything.  
<br />
&quot;The name's Sonic, bud.  You got one?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse's mind raced.  Sonic!  Sonic the Hedgehog!  That was the 
<br />
name they kept hearing in the radio transmissions!  He'd found them.  
<br />
He'd found the freedom fighters!  Tolouse very nearly collapsed in 
<br />
relief, and his heart beat with excitement.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic stood, tapping his foot impatiently.  &quot;Well?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse finally found his voice, and with it his determination.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My name is Tolouse.  And I want to be a Freedom Fighter.&quot;
<br />

<br />
---The End
<br />

<br />
Tolouse's adventures will continue, in &quot;Run with the Fox.&quot;
<br />
