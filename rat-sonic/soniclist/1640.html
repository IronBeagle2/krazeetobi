<br />

<br />

<br />
It was nearing noon over the Great Forest.  The day's activities were in
<br />
full swing for most of the world, and save one--nay, make that two--places,
<br />
it was bathed in a glorious yellow tint from that world's local star.
<br />

<br />
However, the place we shall be focusing on would soon be bathed with light
<br />
as well.  When the sun reached its zeinth above it, focusing mirrors would
<br />
bounce an amplified beam of light off a series of mirrors and focusing
<br />
devices, until the light was a tight, hard beam of energy.  Then, it would
<br />
be shot down from the final mirror, and hit an energy port on a certain 
<br />
still figure laying on a slab in the center of the area.  For 3 minutes,
<br />
this beam would strike the port, raising the object's energy levels back to
<br />
its full capacity.  Then, the mirrors would fall out of alignment, and the
<br />
area would return to its normal, dim state.
<br />

<br />
Seconds later, the sun reached its full height above that area of Mobius'
<br />
horizon, and beams of the life-giving orb fell upon the Dome's clear
<br />
skylight.  The beams reflected off a series of mirrors, through a myraid of
<br />
lenses, and finally struck the lifeless figure's opened abdomen.  The ray
<br />
crashed into a ultraefficent, recently-installed solar panel, and created
<br />
gigawatts of energy within seconds.
<br />

<br />
It continued like this for several minutes, gradually raising the
<br />
temperature inside the glassy structure to an almost unbearable,
<br />
fog-inducing high.  Finally, the sun started to descend toward the other
<br />
parts of Mobius, causing the beam to weaken, dim, and finally die.
<br />

<br />
As the abdomen of the figure closed up, the ventilation system kicked in
<br />
and started pumping the hot air out of the structure.  It traveled through
<br />
a long pipe along the forest floor, and finally was permitted to escape
<br />
several yards away, into another glassy structure.  This one, however, was
<br />
rectangular, and was completely opaque.  It was the size of a small hut,
<br />
and appeared to have no door in or out of it.  The mysterious structure
<br />
released nor admitted a single particle.  Its purpose is only known to
<br />
Joseph, and he has yet to choose to explain its purpose to the common
<br />
populace...
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, Joseph was beginning to regain his senses.  His power levels
<br />
were back where they should be, and the Dome had cooled off rapidly.
<br />
He felt pleased with himself over the device he had constructed, and the
<br />
deroboticizer was coming along nicely.  So, since he had worked so hard the
<br />
last few days, he decided to allow himself a day of leisure.  He took a
<br />
cleansing breath of the charged air, and set himself to the remainder of
<br />
the pressing work that he had to accomplish before going out to `play'.  
<br />
Thus, after he cleaned up the public area in which he now stood of the 
<br />
Dome, and doing some minor body maintanence, he emerged into the warm
<br />
sunlight of the forest floor.
<br />

<br />
It was a lovely afternoon around Knothole, he noted.  The wind was blowing
<br />
toward the wreckage of Robotropolis, so one couldn't smell it.  The sun
<br />
shone through the forest in places, illuminating parts of the well-trod
<br />
path to Knothole irratically.  A few non-evolved rabbits hopped by, 
<br />
looking for clover or grass to eat.  In the distance, he could see the 
<br />
secret entrance to the village, with a few Mobians lurking around it 
<br />
on guard duty.
<br />

<br />
Smiling slightly at the rustic scene, he blasted toward the secret entrance
<br />
at nearly full speed, and stopped just short of flying through it.  His
<br />
control over his new form was improving daily.  Who knows, he thought,
<br />
perhaps it was an even better form than his initial one?  
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the two guards were gradually getting used to Joseph's blazing 
<br />
entrances.  It was usually the way he entered the village, because it was
<br />
the way Sonic usually entered it.  The two were becoming more alike than
<br />
either of the hedgehogs would like to admit.  Yet, Joseph's behavior was
<br />
still more unpredictable than Sonic's...he was slightly more mature than
<br />
his blue twin, and far smarter.  But before either guard could muse on this
<br />
topic further, the orange hedgehog nodded at them and shot through the
<br />
stump with a flourish; to a lower clearing in the forest where 
<br />
Knothole was located.  
<br />

<br />
He popped out of the log, and rolled to a halt upon the pile of hay that
<br />
served as a cushion for incoming Mobians.  He slid off the pile and brushed
<br />
himself off.  Few were around the entrance today...security had become
<br />
slightly more lax since Robotropolis was mostly destroyed.  The mood of the
<br />
village had also become lighter, and a bit more hopeful.  More roboticized
<br />
citizens wandered into the Great Forest daily, and they almost all 
<br />
regained their free will within days...thanks to a quick hack called a
<br />
`Cerebral Re-Activator' Charles and himself had created.
<br />

<br />
However, the newly-reborn roboticized citizens' reaction to Joseph 
<br />
occasionally was not always positive, he ruefully mused.  After someone 
<br />
that had been in the village relayed the story of Charles and Joseph to 
<br />
one of them, the odd cold stare could be felt creeping up his neck by a 
<br />
few irate roboticized citizens.  They didn't dare say anything, of 
<br />
course--Sonic would zealously defend his new intergalactic `brother' 
<br />
as if he were Tails--but he could feel their hatred.  He honestly couldn't
<br />
blame them for it, either...his guilt was not to be purged until the
<br />
deroboticizer was running, and all damaged were healed.  And even then, he
<br />
thought, it'd still be there, albeit weaker than before.  Sighing at this, 
<br />
he walked toward the hub of Knothole, hoping to snag a chili dog or two 
<br />
off Sonic.
<br />

<br />
He walked (he preferred walking within the city limits) into the town
<br />
square, where Sonic was leaning against a tree, munching a chili dog.  When
<br />
Sonic saw Joseph wandering into the village, he waved him over to him, and
<br />
tossed over a chili dog.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yo, Joe!&quot; he hollered, and continued to gnaw on his pork product.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hello, Sonic,&quot; Joseph said, and started eating his.  &quot;Anything new?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nope, just havin' some of Unc' Chuck's chili dogs.&quot;  He looked at the one
<br />
which he had almost completed, and sighed.  &quot;Mmm, I didn't know how
<br />
much I missed these--&quot; He polished that one off in a single motion, 
<br />
and began eating the other, half-eaten, one.  &quot;--chili dogs.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded.  He sometimes envied Sonic's simple approach to life;
<br />
running fast, thwarting `badniks', eating chili dogs, and pursuing the
<br />
mutual affection of the Princess.  No guilt, no internal demons gnawing 
<br />
on his soul about someone else's mistakes, no constant, nagging feeling
<br />
that he's going to fail miserably, or that one of his mistakes could
<br />
destroy the entire world.  No loneliness, no yearning for a home that was
<br />
annhilated centuries ago, or even one pang of misery from the cold looks of
<br />
a roboticized citizen that would make his eyes sting from woe.  Just speed,
<br />
heroism, and the fufillment of carnal desires.  Oh, how that life appealed
<br />
to him!  He wished he could just return to nature; go feral, live in the
<br />
woods, eat berries...but, alas, his new form demanded technology to
<br />
survive.  He was no longer a simple organic construct, he was the last
<br />
remaining creation of his father, his world, his entire culture...he might
<br />
as well wish for a purple sky instead of wishing to escape the
<br />
technological plague that his mind, body, and soul were infected with. 
<br />
Both were about as likely!  
<br />

<br />
It didn't stop him from wishing, tho.  That's all he had; hope, wishes, and
<br />
dim memories and the collected knowledge of a world that nobody could ever
<br />
see, ever again.  He actively despised the last part, especially.  If he
<br />
was just blind to what had happened, and was just a rogue being crusing the
<br />
galaxy for cheap beer and cheaper women, his soul would be far purer.
<br />
But the knowledge made his soul blacker than night.  The evils that his
<br />
world had perpetrated, the curses they had heaped upon themselves...they
<br />
laid only on his shoulders now.  It was his only inheritance.
<br />

<br />
At night, he looked for the star that Ur'thae used to orbit, and waited
<br />
patiently for the one moment when the light of the explosion would
<br />
finally reach Mobius.  Only then would he believe it was actually gone.
<br />
He didn't want to believe it was dust...he so wanted to blame the live body
<br />
of his father for this, just to get the hatred away from him.  But his
<br />
father was dead, as was his world.  He was the only target left for Mobius'
<br />
anger, so he would take it all upon himself.  He was glad his father
<br />
couldn't see this world now--
<br />

<br />
&quot;Joe!  Snap out of it!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph returned to his normal mental state.  &quot;Sorry,&quot; he embarrassedly
<br />
said, &quot;I was thinking about something.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You think too much.&quot; was Sonic's reply.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes,&quot; Joseph said, &quot;I do.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic kept eating his chili dog.  &quot;Anyway, nothin's up now.&quot;  He smirked.  
<br />
&quot;It's just another boring day in Paradise.&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, in the smouldering wreckage of Robotroplis:
<br />

<br />
Snively flew around the perimeter of Robotropolis in Robotnik's hovercraft
<br />
(which gave him a great deal of satisfaction) assessing the progress of the
<br />
reconstruction of Robotropolis.  For the most part, the progress was
<br />
positive; without bothering to rebuild all the useless, smoke-belching
<br />
factories, and only rebuilding the essential parts of Robotropolis, the
<br />
reconstruction would only take another 6 months or so.  SWATBot production
<br />
was up, so soon regular patrols could start again.
<br />

<br />
However, Snively was becoming progressively more irritated with the lack of
<br />
Worker-Bots remaining to do the menial work of Robotropolis.  Apparently,
<br />
most of them were simply wandering off into the Great Forest.  Also, a good
<br />
portion were being abducted by Freedom Fighters.  This was really beginning
<br />
to bother him, because he was forced to call in other platoons of
<br />
Worker-Bots from other installations all over the planet.  If this kept up,
<br />
soon Mobius would be liberated from sheer lack of an occupying force.
<br />

<br />
But Snively let not this bring him down.  After all, he was Snively the
<br />
Great, Ruler of Robotropolis, Conqueror of Mobius, Master of All He
<br />
Surveyed!  No problem could hold *him* back for long.  He'd just think of a
<br />
way around it!  He laughed fiendishly.  And soon, he'd destroy the Freedom 
<br />
Fighters once and for all!
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Back in Knothole:
<br />

<br />
Sonic and Joseph were leaning against a tree, and they were up to about
<br />
their 4th chili dog each when Charles walked over to them and greeted them.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hello, boys,&quot; Charles' metallic voice spoke, as he took a seat on a nearby
<br />
stump.  &quot;What are you up to today?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic shrugged.  &quot;Not much, Unc.  I'm chillin' until Sal needs me for
<br />
somethin'.  Maybe I'll get to go to ex-'BUTT-nikland to kick some more
<br />
SWATBot tail!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles smiled.  &quot;Son, at the rate you kick 'Bot butt, we're not going to
<br />
have a single one left standing for target practice.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I know!  Isn't that Way Past Cool?!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles laughed.  &quot;Yes, Sonic, it is.&quot;  He turned toward Joseph as Sonic
<br />
started into another chili dog.  &quot;How about you, lad?  Are you just going 
<br />
to take a break today...you should, considering you haven't left that dome 
<br />
in 2 weeks.&quot;  The metallic hedgehog smirked.  &quot;I'm surprised you haven't 
<br />
discovered the secrets of the universe yet; you've not stopped work in 
<br />
all this time to go out and relax.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I'm not quite the vacationing type,&quot; smirked Joseph, &quot;and besides,&quot; He
<br />
regained a more serious expression.  &quot;it's important to all of Mobius 
<br />
that I perfect this device.  Then, Robotnik will truely be dead.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; said Charles, &quot;give yourself SOME time to relax.  We don't want you
<br />
to have a nervous breakdown or anything like that.  We do have a good chunk
<br />
of time left for you and I to work in.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded somberly.  &quot;It's as much for your benefit as it is mine.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles understood this silently.  &quot;Look, just don't work yourself to
<br />
death.&quot;  He smirked.  &quot;You're the other resident expert on the roboticizing
<br />
process, so stay alive long enough to finish the deroboticizer, okay?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph chuckled.  &quot;Okay, okay, I get the idea.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic chose then to complete his dog.  After gulping it down, he said,
<br />
&quot;Anyway, how're you doing, Unc?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Me?  Oh, I'm fine.  I just completed work on the Cerebral Re-Activator
<br />
Ray--something I had in the works after Joseph and I completed the
<br />
nonmobile chamber--and it should greatly raise the number of roboticized
<br />
citizens we're able to return here.  All you have to do is make sure the
<br />
beam hits the head of the target, and their mind will override the
<br />
programming Robotnik put in them.&quot;  He smirked.  &quot;And I'll have it in the
<br />
stores by Christmas.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic smiled.  &quot;Way Past Cool, Unc!  That'll make Sal happy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded.  &quot;Affirmative.  That will really be a big help.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles bowed.  &quot;I try.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Then, Bunnie wandered over from a nearby hut.  &quot;Hi, sugahhogs!&quot; she shouted,
<br />
and hopped over to the tree.  &quot;Anythin' new?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Whenever Joseph looked at Bunnie--ever since he learned of the true nature
<br />
of the roboticizer, that is--he always felt a pang of sorrow for the
<br />
damaged rabbit.  Her body had been cursed with those ugly steel limbs, yet
<br />
she continued to be as she always had been.  His awe of her sheer will to
<br />
be happy was only exceeded by his shock of her lack of external bitterness
<br />
toward her life.  She was a survivor, and she still considered herself
<br />
(publicily, anyway) beautiful...yet, Joseph could not help but feel a
<br />
dagger plunged into his psyche from the sight of her.  He knew it wasn't
<br />
his fault for any of this, but he still felt responsible...she was one of
<br />
the main reasons he worked so hard on the deroboticizer.  It was one thing
<br />
to see someone who was totally roboticized: at least that person had lost
<br />
all of their external links to nature.  But Bunnie still was warm to the
<br />
touch, still had sparkling blue eyes to admire the world with...and a steel
<br />
arm to touch things with, and metal legs to walk across it.  He felt 
<br />
that she was a metaphor for Mobius; damaged, sick from the contaminants 
<br />
that seeped into her; yet still strong and determined to be well again.  
<br />

<br />
Sonic shook his head.  &quot;Nope.&quot;  He smirked.  &quot;The metalheads are just 
<br />
talkin' shop.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles and Joseph laughed.  &quot;That we are,&quot; said Joseph, suddenly breaking 
<br />
from his internal anguish.
<br />

<br />
Bunnie smiled.  &quot;Well, god forbid Ah keep y'all from yaur work.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph shrugged.  &quot;Well, we're not accomplishing a whole lot now.&quot;  He 
<br />
smiled at her.  &quot;How are you doing?  Are you doing anything interesting?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Nah,&quot; she said, &quot;Ah'm jus' killing tahm until Sal needs muh.&quot;  She looked
<br />
around a bit.  &quot;It's a slow day in Knothole today, sugah.  Nuthin's gonna
<br />
happen 'til tonight, when we'll get s'more people outa Robo-tropolis.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Joseph raised an eyebrow.  &quot;There's gonna be a mission tonight?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Bunnie bemusedly looked at him.  &quot;Yah, sugah, there's been a mission ev'ry
<br />
night.  Didn'--&quot;  Then, she realized something.  &quot;Oh yah, you've been
<br />
inside the whole time.  You wouldn' know.&quot;
<br />

<br />
While Joseph mulled this over, Charles broke into the conversation.  He 
<br />
smiled, and said, &quot;Excellent.  Now my new device can be tested!&quot;  Before
<br />
Bunnie could ask, Charles explained what he had made.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Y'all better tell Sal about that, sugah.&quot;  She waved to Sonic and Joseph,
<br />
and took Charles by the hand.  &quot;She's planning the mission now,&quot; she said,
<br />
&quot;So c'mon, let's go.&quot;  She dragged the disoriented Charles off to see the 
<br />
Princess, while Sonic and Joe looked on.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Well,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;if that thing works, it'll be Way Past Cool!  No more
<br />
dragging spastic 'bots back to Knothole!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded, and smiled.  &quot;It'll certainly save you a lot of time.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;I hope so,&quot; he said, &quot;Joe, how I hope so.&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Snively sat down in the large green chair that was the main piece of
<br />
furniture in the control center.  He observed the various screens that
<br />
displayed live video of areas all over Robotropolis, not to mention Mobius
<br />
itself.  It looked quiet today; the Freedom Fighters still only became
<br />
overtly active at night.  
<br />

<br />
He pushed some buttons, and reveled in the fact he was sitting in
<br />
Robotnik's chair.  He spun it around a few times to gloat.  After growing
<br />
tired of that, he talked into the intercom.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Attention all SWATBots!&quot; he piped, &quot;roboticize all remaining prisoners,
<br />
and send them to work in Sectors 5A, 6G, and 436A-5.&quot;
<br />

<br />
A metallic voice on the other side acknoledged his transmission.
<br />

<br />
He smirked evilly.  &quot;And do it slowly.&quot;
<br />

<br />
A quiet beep was heard from the speaker, and it fell silent.
<br />

<br />
Satisfied with that, he thought of other things he needed to do that day.
<br />
He had covered Robotnik's usual itinerary; He'd surveyed the landsdscape, 
<br />
ordered the daily robotization, had lunch, sneered at the Great Forest, 
<br />
brooded about the domination of Mobius, and abused a SWATBot.  The 
<br />
Worker-Bots and SWATBots were able to handle the actual repairs by 
<br />
themselves, and the refinaries would do just fine without any 
<br />
Sniv-intervention for a year.  He sighed, as bored badniks are wont to on
<br />
occasions such as these.  What to do, what to do...
<br />

<br />
Then, his eyes brightened as he realized what he could do to pass the time.
<br />

<br />
He walked over to a R&amp;D laboratory close by to the Control Center.  He
<br />
entered it, and gazed upon an object he was keeping in here for its own
<br />
good.  
<br />

<br />
A Worker-Bot on the far side of Mobius, while in a crystal mine, hit the
<br />
large stone while trying to dig out a particularly tenacious formation.
<br />
It broke the pickaxe on contact.  So, following its programming, it called 
<br />
over a SWATBot for assistance.  It blasted the stone out, and when it could
<br />
not determine its nature, sent it to Robotropolis a few days after
<br />
Doomsday had miserably failed (...as expected).  
<br />

<br />
Since then, Snively was trying to figure out exactly how this stone, 
<br />
the Amber Chaos Emerald, worked.  
<br />

<br />
He decided against trying to make it power Robotropolis...Robotnik had
<br />
tried something similar once, and Snively thus reasoned that that course of
<br />
action would be suicide until the Freedom Fighters could be eliminated;
<br />
they would notice the sudden lack of smoke being belched out of the city,
<br />
and go to in to investigate, and then they'd find some way of stealing the
<br />
emerald from him.
<br />

<br />
So, he decided to pick a less obvious use for the emerald, yet one totally
<br />
predicitable to any individual familiar with Snively's mind: convert it
<br />
into a weapon that could destroy the Great Forest, and reveal Knothole.
<br />
However, this course of action was mysteriously difficult to accomplish.
<br />
The Emerald Ray would destroy non-natural things completely; SWATBots,
<br />
Worker-Bots, garbage, anything that was manufactured.  But if it was fired
<br />
at a tree, or a small animal, it'd heal it and make it stronger.
<br />
That annoyed him to no end.  But, he was determined to bend the emerald to
<br />
his will, no matter how difficult it would be to do so.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The sun was beginning to set, which signaled Knothole to begin to prepare 
<br />
for the night's activities.  The Mobian village put away its things from
<br />
the day's work, ate its dinner, and cleaned up everything else before 
<br />
preparing for a restful sleep.  Everyone, that is, but the Freedom Fighters
<br />
who were about to go out for a night's mission.
<br />

<br />
Sonic, Sally, Antoine, Charles, Dulcy and Bunnie were standing 
<br />
around the updated holographic depiction of Robotropolis, planning their 
<br />
route in and out in order to get as many people out as they could in a 
<br />
night.  The Cerebral Re-Activator Ray dramatically increased this number, 
<br />
so they figured on getting (at the least) about 20-25 people out that 
<br />
night.  
<br />

<br />
While they were discussing their plans, Joseph sat outside the hut,
<br />
silently listening to their plans.  He'd never been on a mission, and he
<br />
always had wondered how one had been organized.  Quite well, by his
<br />
observations.  Maybe they'd ask him to tag along one day...
<br />

<br />
He heard movement in the hut, and disappeared up a tree.  Using his martial
<br />
arts training, he slipped into the shadows without a sound.  Sonic was the
<br />
first to emerge.  &quot;I'm gonna bag a ring, Sal,&quot; he said into the hut, and
<br />
ran off to the Power Ring Pool.  A few seconds after he left, the rest of
<br />
the Knothole crew went outside the hut.  They divided into teams, and
<br />
the leader of each team recieved a pistol to zap roboticized citizens with.
<br />
A second later, Sonic arrived with his ring.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Charles, you're with Antoine,&quot; Sally said, &quot;and Bunnie, you're with me.  
<br />
Sonic will provide the diversion, and we'll ship the roboticized citizens
<br />
out on you, Dulcy.&quot;  She looked at the dragon.  &quot;Do you remember the 
<br />
rendezvous point, Dulcy?&quot;  The dragon nodded.  &quot;Good.&quot;  She took another
<br />
deep breath.  &quot;The last ride out is at 00:00, at the predetermined
<br />
rendevous point.&quot;  She looked at her watch.  &quot;Okay, sync your watches 
<br />
at 21:00.....now!&quot;  A round of beeping later, everyone had the same time.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Everyone ready?&quot;  A round of nodding.  &quot;Okay, everyone on Dulcy but
<br />
Sonic.&quot;  They boarded the dragon.  &quot;Sonic, you rem--&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Like the recipe for Unc Chuck's chili dogs, Sal.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sally smirked.  &quot;Then go!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic, with a wink and a flourish, took off toward Robotropolis.  After
<br />
waiting a minute or two, Dulcy got a running start, and also took off
<br />
toward Robotropolis.  
<br />

<br />
After they had left, Joseph lept out of the tree, and landed quietly on the
<br />
ground.  He vaguely considered going home, and waiting for them to return,
<br />
which would be what a logical, rational person would do.  But, for some 
<br />
reason, he had a yearning to pursue them.  He wanted to kick 'bot butt as
<br />
well.  (Such feelings were becoming more common as the hedgehog DNA began
<br />
to sink deeper in to his genetic makeup.)  He pondered for about 5 minutes,
<br />
but finally snapped.  He was going to follow them.  But he wouldn't
<br />
interfere; he'd watch from a distance cloaked.  To study Mobian guerilla
<br />
warfare.  That's it.  He would *study* them.  It wasn't tagging along when
<br />
he was forbidden to, it was science!  He checked Bahb's energy levels. 
<br />
Once he was sure they were up to 100%, he took off toward Robotropolis as
<br />
well.    
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
Snivley stared into the control center's screens.  So far, the Freedom
<br />
Fighters hadn't shown up for the night's attempt at freeing Worker-Bots.
<br />
He had, like he had done for the last several nights, dedicated himself to
<br />
killing them all tonight.  He put Robotropolis on full alert, and had
<br />
his aerial forces circling the perimeter, as usual.  There would be no
<br />
mistakes tonight.  
<br />

<br />
I(vos)H(yper)A(c)T(iv)ET(rackerof)H(e)AT(fromthe)HEDGEHOG (Robotnik's 
<br />
last joke.  The acronym is I.HATE.THAT.HEDGEHOG.  He always did make 
<br />
really, REALLY stupid jokes, Sniv thought.) radar beeped, detecting 
<br />
Sonic roaring in to start the eternal diversion.  Sniv wondered what he'd 
<br />
hit tonight.  He was running out of things to destroy...Robotropolis 
<br />
wasn't much now to begin with.  The lazer fire he heard, and the 
<br />
SWATBot calls for backup seemed to denote that Sonic was assulting one of
<br />
their primary refineries again.  Snively growled.  He either let the
<br />
hedgehog weaken Robotropolis further by destroying the refinary, or let the
<br />
hedgehog weaken Robotropolis further by his abduction of Worker-Bots.
<br />
Snively was beginning to DESPISE these Catch-22s.  Resources for SWATBot 
<br />
production was going from 300% to 500% tomorrow, he vowed annoyedly.  
<br />
Then, Snively angrily activated the intercom.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;Attention all SWATBots!  Hedgehog alert!  Report to Refinery 24-A!&quot; he
<br />
bellowed, &quot;AND SHOOT TO KILL!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Snively realized that this was going to leave the Worker-Bots in Sectors G,
<br />
H, and I unguarded and ripe for FF attack.  But the refinery was more
<br />
important to Sniv, so he forced himself to tolorate the FF damage of his
<br />
labor force.  (Needlenose isn't the brightest bulb in the box, y'know.)
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Sonic raced through the refinary, smashing the hell out of anything that
<br />
looked fragile or important.  Dodging SWATBot fire, he swerved to and fro
<br />
inside the building, spin-dashing through the metallic menaces.  It would
<br />
normally take him maybe 5 minutes to totally disable one of these
<br />
establishments, but he needed to buy lots of time for the rest of the FFs
<br />
who were rescuing citizens.  So, he simply continued to race back and forth
<br />
irratically, damaging and destroying as much stuff as he could.  
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, the first 5 people they were able to grab and zap were loaded 
<br />
onto Dulcy, and were flown back to the Great Forest as fast as Dulcy 
<br />
could manage.  They were disoriented, but they got themselves together
<br />
enough to hang on to the dragon for dear life.  
<br />

<br />
Joseph was watching the whole scene from a safe distance on the eastern
<br />
limits of Robotropolis.  He'd tapped into the security system, and was
<br />
getting a Sniv's-eye view of what was happening.  (He was also blanking
<br />
certain screens at random times, so to make it appear like simple technical
<br />
problems as a result of Doomsday, to keep Sniv from knowing where the FFs
<br />
were...but it wasn't directly hurting anything, so it was okay!)  It
<br />
appeared to Joseph that what Sonic had told him about Snively was correct.
<br />
He was a freakin' moron.  He was concentrating a majority of his forces in
<br />
one localized area to fight one Freedom Fighter from destroying something
<br />
that would be vital in the short-term; while the majority of the 
<br />
Freedom Fighters were all over Robotropolis, taking a resource away that
<br />
would be vital for the long-term survival of Robotropolis.
<br />

<br />
His brother would have a cerebral hemorrhage from watching this.
<br />

<br />
Joseph smiled when he thought of his brother.  Jhack was a big, tough
<br />
high-ranking member of the warrior caste, a master of all things tactical. 
<br />
He always kicked Joseph's butt in jed'ar (a game similiar to chess).  He
<br />
would have loved to watch this conflict unfold; it was a classic example of
<br />
unconventional warfare toppling a conventional regime.  He missed him
<br />
sometimes.  Sighing, he went back to watching the chaos unfold...
<br />

<br />
Then, he noticed something.  There were no SWATBots around the Command
<br />
Center.  Nary a one.  They were all either at the Refinary, or guarding the
<br />
prison blocks.  Sniv left his front door wide open, but locked the back!
<br />
Quickly, Joseph debated how to utilize this information.  Should he sneak
<br />
into it and directly sabotage the command center, and risk capture, or
<br />
should he try and tell someone else?  He shook his head.  No, telling
<br />
someone else would endanger the mission.  If anything was to be done, he'd
<br />
have to do it himself.  What to do...
<br />

<br />
He took a 25 Mobium coin from the side of his boot.  He examined it.  The
<br />
side he was looking at had a grim-faced King Acorn on it, with some writing
<br />
along the side.  &quot;Heads, I go, tails, I don't.&quot;  He flipped the coin, and 
<br />
caught it in midair.  He opened his hand; heads.  He smiled.  &quot;Very well, 
<br />
I go.&quot;  He quickly removed all evidence he had ever been there, threw the 
<br />
coin over his shoulder, and stealthily stalked toward the egg-shaped 
<br />
Command Center.  The coin flipped over again when it hit the ground; on
<br />
that side, Acorn was smiling.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Sonic was beginning to tire of bouncing off the refinary walls.  He was not
<br />
only running out of things to smash, but the whole thing was getting old.
<br />
He just wanted to trash the damn thing, and move on to something more
<br />
interesting.  But what?  This was the only distraction Sally had given him.
<br />
He didn't know what other targets to hit.  There wasn't much left!
<br />

<br />
Then, it occurred to him that he could drag all the SWATBots into the
<br />
center of 'BUTT-nikville by attacking the control center.  Then, the rest
<br />
of the place would be nearly empty, and Sal could grab LOTS of guys and
<br />
gals.  He was rather pleased with himself for thinking at such a supersonic
<br />
pace.  
<br />

<br />
So, the next pass by the control room, instead of blasting past it, he
<br />
blasted into it.  This bought him a few precious seconds while he pressed
<br />
every button in the room, pulled every switch, and generally started
<br />
trashing the place.  Alarms upon alarms went off as the entire plant went
<br />
critical.  &quot;WARNING!  AUTODESTRUCT MODE ENGAGED!  30 SECONDS UNTIL
<br />
AUTODESTRUCT.  29.  28.  27.  26.  25....&quot;  Sonic took that cue to juice 
<br />
on outa there.  He engaged a little bit of power ring, and left a 
<br />
deafening sonic boom to be the harbringer of the larger orange-yellow 
<br />
explosion seconds later.
<br />

<br />
Snively went spastic.  Now not only had the Freedom Fighters gotten several
<br />
more Worker-Bots than usual out of Robotropolis, his favorite refinary was
<br />
totally destroyed.  He screamed and pounded his fists against the chair, a
<br />
la Robotnik.  &quot;I HATE THAT HEDGEHOG!!&quot; he hollered as he ordered every
<br />
resource he had available to stop the hedgehog from escaping.
<br />

<br />
But meanwhile...
<br />

<br />
Joseph approached the central entrance point for the egg-shaped
<br />
control center.  As more SWATBots streamed out of it, he quickly snuck in
<br />
against the flow of traffic and got past the 'bot dispatch point without a
<br />
hitch.  Sniv was too irate at the recent destruction of some installation
<br />
he liked to put up floating spybots inside his own inner sanctum.  Joseph
<br />
took this as a good omen, and traversed his way up the access stairs.
<br />

<br />
After walking for a few minutes (and hiding from a few SWATBots that were
<br />
rapidly streaming down the stairs as well) up the stairs, he finally came
<br />
to the outer fringes of Sniv' innermost sancti sanctum.  This was obviously
<br />
where all the really important stuff was.  Various sensitive and fragile
<br />
computers were hidden all the way up here, not to mention Sniv's R&amp;D labs.
<br />
He was really losing a lot of respect for Needlenose.  And since he didn't
<br />
have a lot to begin with, that's saying something.
<br />

<br />
He walked into the center of the room, and observed some monitors.  Ooohing
<br />
at the stuff he saw, he extended his dataspike from his right arm and
<br />
started downloading all of it.  After an incredibly short period of time,
<br />
he got it all.  200 virus checks later (2 seconds), he compiled it and
<br />
mulled over the information.  The latest version of the roboticizer
<br />
software, plans for everything Robotropolis had, locations of bases, codes,
<br />
everything Sniv didn't want anyone to know about he had.  Joseph cackled
<br />
quietly.  This would certainly be useful--he heard a noise.  Quickly, he
<br />
hid behind a pile of old boxes, and waited to see who drew near... 
<br />

<br />
Snively stomped down the stairs, and rushed into his R&amp;D room.  He
<br />
*thought* he heard the sound of rapid downloading, but there was obviously
<br />
nobody there.  Quickly, he ran to the back of the room to fetch his Emerald
<br />
Ray.  He kicked some boxes out of the way as he reached the zero-energy
<br />
field in which he kept it--a shadow--he turned to look behind the pile...
<br />

<br />
^L
<br />

<br />
Nothing.  Sniv shuddered.  He must be so angry, he thought, his mind was 
<br />
starting to play tricks on him.  He took a breath, and took the gun from
<br />
the field.  He wanted to be sure that he had it with him if the hedgehog 
<br />
tried to attack him tonight, and he believed he'd figured out how to make 
<br />
it kill.  He didn't know, tho, but he didn't want to have it laying out, 
<br />
anyway.  He rushed out of the room and shot back upstairs to the central 
<br />
control center, beginning to snarl somethin' fierce.
<br />

<br />
After he had left, Joseph cautiously poked his head out.  Sniv had taken
<br />
some sort of weapon from the far side of the room, and rushed back
<br />
upstairs.  Obviously, it was meant to attack Sonic with.  He hoped he'd be
<br />
able to evade it once Sniv started pursuing Sonic actively.  
<br />

<br />
Either way, he had what he basically needed.  Now, he'd just set up a nice
<br />
cat's-cradle program within the Robotropolis computer system OS, and...
<br />

<br />
&quot;RED ALERT!  RED ALERT!  HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Alarms!  Had he been discovered?  Arrgh!  He had no time left now.  Quickly,
<br />
he looked around for an exit.  He couldn't take the door--footsteps!  Shit!
<br />
He spotted a vent and jumped up and through it, closing it behind him.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
But it was not Joseph that set off the alarms.  It was the first
<br />
Mobius-biased Freedom Fighter hedgehog, Sonic, who set off the alarms.
<br />
He managed to set off every alarm system that Sniv had downstairs, calling
<br />
every SWATBot in Robotropolis back home to defend it from the blue blaze of
<br />
vengence that was Sonic.  He started his usual smash-and-run technique
<br />
there, attempting to take down the central Robotropolis SWATBot dispatch
<br />
grid, the food machines, and anything else that looked somewhat valuable. 
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
But Snivley knew the alarms to be the work of the hedgehog.  Immediately,
<br />
he rushed down the stairs, through his lab, and to a secret minihangar. 
<br />
There, Snivley kept *his* new pride-and-joy, Robotnik's old hovercraft.
<br />
He'd dug it out of the wreckage, and refurnished it himself.  It looked as
<br />
good as new, and now he'd add one more accessory to it; his (hopefully)
<br />
new Emerald Death Ray.  
<br />

<br />
He slapped the turret into place in front of the hovercraft, and jumped
<br />
inside of it.  Wasting no time, he started the formitable craft and blasted
<br />
out through a nearby wall.
<br />

<br />
The unexpected explosion was felt all over the remains of Robotropolis. 
<br />
When the Freedom Fighters spotted the hovercraft, several of the
<br />
weaker-hearted (namely, Antoine) quickly panicked.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Aaaa!!  It is zee Robotnik!  Ze has come back from ze dead to make us
<br />
dead like heem!  Aaaaa!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles didn't even try to calm him down.  &quot;Run!&quot; shouted Sir Charles, and
<br />
took the petrified Antoine by the paw as the remainder of the rescued 
<br />
roboticized bretheren followed suit.
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, Sonic rushed out of the building, dodging some irksome SWATBot
<br />
fire, and was observing the hovership's flight path.  He was apparently
<br />
circling the center of Robotropolis, looking for where the hedgehog might
<br />
have hidden.  He quickly came to the conclusion that he'd give the ship
<br />
something to look for.
<br />

<br />
He rushed over to the center of the street, and started yelling.  
<br />
&quot;HEY, NEEDLENOSE!&quot; he yowled from the streets below, &quot;YEAH, YOU IN
<br />
RO-CLUCKNIK'S RIDE!&quot;  This sucessfully got Snively's attention.  
<br />
&quot;PREPARE TO DIE, HEDGEHOG!&quot; he bellowed, and started firing amber beams 
<br />
down upon him.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Uh-oh.&quot; Sonic thought, and swiftly began swerving through the center of
<br />
Robotropolis to avoid the beams.  &quot;Stand still!&quot; Snively muttered as he
<br />
continued aiming, firing, and missing the hedgehog.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph was watching the battle unfold from inside the intake vent for the
<br />
Control Center, high up on the remains of the `roof' (if an egg-shaped 
<br />
structure can have a `roof').  He had noted that even though Snively
<br />
believed he was weaving around as irratically as the hedgehog, he passed
<br />
through a certain area of space every few seconds or so.  Joseph was
<br />
working on refining the exact target area, and was beginning to time his
<br />
envelope so he'd know when to....now!  Snively had passed through a section
<br />
of space every 2.3 minutes.  In another 2.3 minutes, he'd be there again,
<br />
and then would be the time Joseph would enact his plan.
<br />

<br />
He watched silently from his perch, continuing to watch the battle
<br />
unnoticed.  Sonic was irritating Snively rather efficiently.  Apparently,
<br />
whatever sort of `ray' he was using was constantly missing the hedgehog,
<br />
and he was making sure Snively knew it.  &quot;HEY SNOTLEY!  NICE AIM!&quot;  &quot;YOU 
<br />
WILL EAT THOSE WORDS, HEDGEHOG!&quot;  And then another barrage of firing from 
<br />
the hovercraft, even more badly aimed than the first.
<br />

<br />
He prepared himself to enact his plan.  30 seconds.  20.  10...9.....
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
At the exact moment Snively first entered an area directly below Joseph's
<br />
vent, he jumped into the hovercraft, taking the repugnant imp by surprise!
<br />
With a smooth movement, Joseph grabbed Snively by the neck, and started
<br />
throttling him.  &quot;Die, you hideous excuse for a semi-evolved simian!&quot; he
<br />
shouted into Snively's ears, and attempted to take control of the craft.
<br />

<br />
But Snively didn't fight fair.  (Or well.)  He kicked at the hedgehog's
<br />
stomach, only to fracture a few toes on the android's chestplate.  Yelling
<br />
in agony, he pulled a small dirk from his belt, and tried to shove it
<br />
through the hedgehog's armpit.  It penetrated it, but didn't even seem to
<br />
slow the creature down...then he got a good look at him, and then that's
<br />
when he really became frightened.
<br />

<br />
He looked like Sonic's body double, aside from the bright silver eyes.
<br />
Also, the hedgehog didn't look like he took prisoners.  After a quick
<br />
assessment of the mood of his attacker, he came to the conclusion that he
<br />
was about to--
<br />

<br />
Joseph knocked the little rodent out with a single punch.  He tore the
<br />
knife from his armpit, and threw it out the window.  Now, while trying 
<br />
to regain control of the odd craft, he was also attempting to disarm the
<br />
strange weapon, which seemed to be approaching overload levels. 
<br />
Apparently, whatever this thing was powered by, it was too much to be
<br />
withheld by the weapon for very long, once it was fired up.  He feared it
<br />
was going to explode, and he was still far too high up to jump--he quickly
<br />
pulled hard to the right, barely missing a tall buidling.  He was still too
<br />
high to jump, and he didn't know how powerful the power source was.  As he
<br />
fumbled around with the access port for the fuel cell, he mused what Sniv
<br />
could have found that was so powerful?  Some sort of radioactive isotope?
<br />
Alien technology?  Perhaps a Keld'yrian had lost something again...
<br />

<br />
All this time, Sonic had been hanging out, watching the aerial battle.
<br />
He was surprised to see his `brother' here, but he was glad he'd shown up.
<br />
Joe'd given Snotley the pounding of his life.  And soon, he'd just bring
<br />
the ship down to Mobius, and then they'd REALLY have him...
<br />

<br />
He finally fumbled with a octogon-shaped thing, and quickly removed it from
<br />
the gun.  He threw the powerless weapon off the ship, and tossed the stone 
<br />
casually into the back seat, not bothering to examine it (steering a 
<br />
unfamiliar ship tends to discourage scientific discovery), and continued to
<br />
attempt to regain control of Robotnik's round hovership.  He tried to make 
<br />
it go lower by cutting the power, but all that suceeded in doing was make 
<br />
the ship slow down.  That wasn't the effect he'd desired, but at least he 
<br />
could concentrate on the altitude control.  As he fiddled with the lever, 
<br />
he realized he was now drifing around on the eastern outskirts of 
<br />
Robotropolis.  He was rather surprised.  This vehicle travelled rather
<br />
quickly.  It must be the lack of its usual load.  He snickered at his joke.
<br />
Robotnik must have needed a whole lotta thrust to move this thing, he
<br />
pondered, and took the lever in his hand.  Then, taking a breath, he began
<br />
to slowly pull the lever down...
<br />

<br />
While Joseph had been trying to regain control, Snively had slowly regained
<br />
consciousness, and gradually came to the conclusion that this passenger was
<br />
not wanted in his hovership.  Reaching silently under the seat as the craft
<br />
started to come to a halt, he pulled out a short pipe Robotnik had kept
<br />
under the seat to club things with if they came too close to him in flight.
<br />
With a slow, purposeful movement, he raised the club above his head, and
<br />
swung just as Joseph was starting to lower the ship slowly to the ground.
<br />

<br />
The impact from the club didn't hurt Joseph as much as it surprised him. 
<br />
The metallic `thud' from the club attempting to damage his right lobe did,
<br />
however, make his teeth rattle unpleasantly.  He fell forward from the
<br />
blow, suddenly sending the small ship on a course straight up into the sky.
<br />
As it rocketed upwards, it began exerting strong g-forces against the
<br />
contents of the craft.  Snively, being a runty little weakling, was
<br />
immediately forced to the floor of the craft after the second g, while
<br />
Joseph (being an android and having more resistance to such things) 
<br />
merely readjusted his stance a bit, and desperately tried to regain 
<br />
control of the reddish blur before it entered a low Mobius orbit.  
<br />

<br />
Sonic watched the ship bob downwards, stop, and then scream up into the
<br />
upper stratasphere.  Needless to say, this surprised him.  Obviously, Joe
<br />
wasn't the world's greatest pilot.  Or maybe he was going to fly all the
<br />
way up there to drop Snively, or--lazer fire from behind him.  Uh-oh.
<br />
The SWATBots had wised up, and now had figured out where he was.  He
<br />
quickly poured on some speed, and raced away from the area, hoping to buy
<br />
Joe some time...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
With a small degree of difficulty, he stuck out his hand and took hold of
<br />
the lever.  Not wanting to be thrown out of the craft, he slowly started to
<br />
pull it back down; and slowly, the ship began to stop.  It came to a halt
<br />
again near the center of the lever's pull-area, to just about the limit of
<br />
the Mobian atmosphere.  Taking the opportunity to relax, seeing that
<br />
Snively was too weak at this height above Mobius to put up any sort of a
<br />
fight, Joseph looked up to note this unique perspective.  He could see the
<br />
darker areas with almost no ozone above it from the lighter, bluish areas
<br />
that had a higher level.  It was odd to observe such a thing; one comes to 
<br />
believe after long examinations of the sky on a clear day that the sky
<br />
seems to be an impervious bubble from which the rest of the universe is
<br />
seperated.  But, he thought, as one gets closer to the fringe of the 
<br />
atmosphere, one can see the small gaps that are formed as air currents 
<br />
cause the air to flow around in erratic patterns, leaving for minutes at a 
<br />
time small holes in the atmosphere; yet, from the ground, the sky always 
<br />
appears to be a solid blue bubble.  It brought to mind a proverb his 
<br />
grandfather had taught him... &quot;Even the strongest wall has a hole.&quot;  He
<br />
waved his hand around in the small, black gap.  &quot;A hole.&quot; he logically 
<br />
said, and exhaled a breath into the hole, filling it.  &quot;Filled.&quot;
<br />

<br />
After looking into the sky some more, he decided to return to a more
<br />
Snively-compatible altitude, before the now quite-cold and weak human went
<br />
and died.  He was sure that Sonic could figure out what to do with him.
<br />
Probably put him on trial and lynch him, or maybe throw him in Ironlock.
<br />
Either way, it was an affair of state, so he'd try to stay out of it.
<br />
He was probably in enough trouble as it was going off to Robotropolis
<br />
without telling anyone.  Ruing Sally's potential wrath, Joseph pulled 
<br />
the lever slowly back, and gradually brought the hovership back closer 
<br />
to Mobius.
<br />

<br />
As he got nearer to the blackish cloud above Robotropolis, Snively began
<br />
coughing himself back to consciousness.  As he entered the murky depths of
<br />
the pollution cloud, all vision became temporarily obscured.  After
<br />
penetrating the center of the cloud, Snively gasped out a few words. 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Where... *cough* are you tak-- *cough* ing me?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You're going back to Robotropolis, Snively.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;*cough* Huh? *cough*&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yeah, you're going back to Robotropolis, and Sonic is going to decide what
<br />
to do to you next.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The ship broke through the cloud, and the air slowly began to clear up. 
<br />
They were still high above the tops of the buildings, tho, but they could
<br />
now both see each other clearly.
<br />

<br />
&quot;The hedgehog won't have the chance to.  My SWATBots will finish him before
<br />
we even hit the ground!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Oh, really?&quot; Joseph snarled, and grabbed Sniv's green collar.  &quot;I don't
<br />
think so, Snotley.&quot;  He lifted the protesting Snively outside the
<br />
hovercraft.  &quot;You're going to call off your marauding SWATBot armies right
<br />
now.&quot;  He grabbed the microphone for the com-unit with his other free hand,
<br />
and shoved it into Snively's face.  &quot;Aren't you?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Searching for any sort of retort, Snively could only gasp.  After a second
<br />
of hanging precariously over the ground, tho, he finally stuttered,
<br />
&quot;Att-t-tention all SWATBots!!  Cease Priority One pursuit and await 
<br />
further orders!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Joseph clicked the microphone off.  &quot;Good work, monkey.  Perhaps we'll keep
<br />
you around to read commercials.&quot;  Snively could only stare blackly at his
<br />
obnoxious orange opponent of his overtaking of Mobius.  &quot;Now, stop
<br />
squirming around, or I'll save Sonic the trouble and snap your neck right
<br />
here.&quot;  The human stopped wiggling.  &quot;Good.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The ship finally came to a slow halt 3 inches above a stretch of road
<br />
somewhere within the center of Robotropolis.  Joseph dragged the whining
<br />
Snively back into the ship, and took him with him as he dehovercrafted out
<br />
the other side.  Looking around, he realized that it was almost time for
<br />
the Freedom Fighters present to go to the rendezvous point on the outskirts
<br />
of town, and then return to Knothole for the night.  Quickly, he realized
<br />
he'd have to get their attention in order to bring them back here.  So, he
<br />
shook Snively again.  &quot;Flares!  I need a flare gun!  Now!&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Snively quickly gesticulated to the glove compartment, where there was a
<br />
loaded, largish flare gun.  Joseph quickly grabbed it, and fired the device
<br />
into the air.  It shot into the sky, and into a bank of explosive gas that
<br />
one of the factories had recently set off.  The ignited phosphorous in the
<br />
flare reacted with the various methanes in the cloud, and created a large
<br />
explosion that quickly became a massive one.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, Sonic and the rest of the Freedom Fighters had assembled with a
<br />
large group of recently renewed roboticized Mobian citizens.  Sonic was
<br />
attempting to explain what had happened to him as quickly as possible.
<br />

<br />
&quot;...and then, Joe comes flyin' off the roof of Sniv's command center, right?!
<br />
He must've said something cool like me, and done some of that wicked 
<br />
kung-fu stuff he does, 'cuz Sniv went down for the count in a Sonic Second!
<br />
Then, he starts joyriding in 'BUTT-nik's hovercraft, and was tryin' to land
<br />
but Snotley musta done somethin' 'cuz Joe fell forward and hit some lever 
<br />
and then the ship went screamin' up, up, Way Past Up into the sky, 
<br />
right about--&quot; and just as he pointed to where it went up, a small flare
<br />
went up into a small cloud.  Within seconds, the whole sky seemed to be
<br />
on fire.  &quot;--there.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;He must be in trouble!&quot; Sally said, &quot;Sonic, go--&quot;
<br />

<br />
When Sonic heard the word `go', he figured out the rest for himself. 
<br />
Quickly (which is the way he did most things), he took out a power ring and
<br />
ultra-juiced toward the center of Robotropolis.  
<br />

<br />
As he entered Robotropolis, the usual entourage of SWATBots arrived, and
<br />
began chase.  Normally, he'd be pelted by lazer fire, but this time they
<br />
only followed him.  Sonic found this odd, naturally, and came to a
<br />
temporary stop a few blocks from the flare's origin.  The SWATBots came to
<br />
a halt about 30 feet away, and floated in mid-air omniously.  They stared
<br />
at each other for a few moments.  Then, Sonic broke the silence.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hey, bucketheads!  Why don't you shoot me?!  I'm the Hedgehog Priority
<br />
One!  Your JOB is to shoot me!&quot; 
<br />

<br />
The SWATBots looked at each other for a few moments, obviously relaying
<br />
information back and forth.  Then, the bot on the pursuit module closest to
<br />
him said, &quot;Snively has overrode our programming, and has ordered all units
<br />
to pursue, but not damage or terminate Hedgehog Priority One.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic looked puzzled.  &quot;Why?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Unknown,&quot; the 'bot said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Way Past Weird,&quot; Sonic thought, &quot;maybe Snively's captured Joseph, and
<br />
wants me as ransom.&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that, Sonic took off again, toward the center of Robotropolis.  A
<br />
second later, the 'bots took off after him.
<br />

<br />
Joseph was beating Snively's head against a wall to sedate him when Sonic
<br />
arrived seconds later, being trailed by the oddly non-violent SWATBots.
<br />
Sonic's view of the situation changed rapidly after that.  &quot;Yo, Joe!&quot; he
<br />
shouted, and ran closer to the orange doppleganger.
<br />

<br />
Joseph stopped clobbering Snively for a moment, and allowed his stunned
<br />
body to slump to the ground.  &quot;Hey, Sonic.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic looked at Joseph, then at Snively.  &quot;I see you've been busy,&quot; Sonic
<br />
smirked, &quot;but you didn't leave a lot for me to play with!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph shrugged.  &quot;The opportunity presented itself, so I seized it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic kicked Snively lightly in the chest, which didn't seem to phase him.
<br />
&quot;Looks like he's just about ready to die.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;You want to do the honors, Sonic?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Huh?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Do you,&quot; Joseph plainly spoke, &quot;want to finish him off?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic looked at Joseph strangely.  &quot;You mean...&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Kill him.  Yes.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic's face went blank as he considered this.  If he killed Snively, it
<br />
would finally put an end to all of Robotnik's legacy in one blow.  No more
<br />
roboticized people.  No more pointless deaths.  The world could be
<br />
beautiful and clean again.  Joseph would make a deroboticizer, Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Bunnie and everyone else would be well again, and they'd find a way to
<br />
bring back King Acorn.  And everything would be beautiful and clean again.
<br />

<br />
But Sonic had never killed anything before.  He didn't think he could....
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
He remembered when he was a young hedgehog, and he'd built a small rabbit
<br />
trap.  He'd built it because he'd overheard Uncle Chuck complaining to one
<br />
of his friends about how rabbits kept getting through the fence he'd built
<br />
somehow, and eating his produce.  So, Sonic decided he'd make Unc Chuck
<br />
proud of him, and kill the rabbit that kept getting in the next time it
<br />
tried.  He thought of the proper way of constructing such a trap, collected
<br />
enough stuff to make it out of, and snuck into Uncle Chuck's workshop to
<br />
build it.
<br />

<br />
He'd been proud of that trap, he recalled, and he'd tested it throughly to
<br />
be sure it'd work.  It was a small wooden cage, held together with bits of
<br />
twine.  The front of it opened up with hinges, and a small stick would hold
<br />
it up.  A little piece of string could then be attached to it, and close
<br />
the cage.  In retrospect, it was a pathetic, primitive device, but it did
<br />
the job...
<br />

<br />
He'd set it out in the back yard, in the middle of the garden.  In it, he'd
<br />
put a carrot, covered with a layer of peanut butter.  (Uncle Chuck had told
<br />
him once that small animals loved the taste of it, so Sonic put it on as
<br />
additional `bait'.)  Then, he covered the string with a thin layer of dirt,
<br />
so to be sure the animal couldn't see it, and hid in a bush.
<br />

<br />
About 15 minutes later, the rabbit hopped into the yard.  It sniffed
<br />
around, nibbled on some lettuce, and then noticed the peanut-butter carrot.
<br />
As planned, it hopped into the cage.  The second it was all the way in, he
<br />
pulled the rope, and closed the cage.  The rabbit frantically tried to push
<br />
its way out, but it was far too weak to push open the door.  
<br />

<br />
Sonic cheered upon capturing the rabbit.  Uncle Chuck would be so proud of
<br />
him!  He'd get a few extra chili dogs for this!  But, he thought, he'd have
<br />
to finish the job.  So, he found a large rock that would eclipse the cage,
<br />
and difficultly picked it up.  By slowly walking toward the cage, he was able
<br />
to keep the rock above his head so to more easily smash the rabbit.  He
<br />
finally arrived close enough to the cage to see the rabbit.
<br />

<br />
The pathetic look in its eyes drained Sonic of its resolve.  No matter how
<br />
much vegetables it had eaten, Sonic had thought, it didn't deserve to die
<br />
for it.  He just threw the rock in the opposite direction, toward a small
<br />
creek, and ran away from the cage.
<br />

<br />
A minute or two later, he was able to find Uncle Chuck at the chili dog
<br />
stand.  He waited until he was done serving a customer, and then explained
<br />
the situation to him.
<br />

<br />
Oddly enough, Charles had said, &quot;Sonic, I'm proud of you for not 
<br />
killing that rabbit.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic blinked.  &quot;I don't get it, Uncle Chuck.  Why?  I chickened out.  I
<br />
choked.&quot;  
<br />

<br />
Charles put his hand on his shoulder.  &quot;Sonic, you didn't kill that rabbit
<br />
not because you're not brave, you didn't because you felt it was wrong. 
<br />
Your conscience told you not to, because you know it is wrong to kill.
<br />
That's not a bad thing.  In fact, it's good.  If more people were like you,
<br />
Mobius would be a perfect world.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Really?&quot; Sonic said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes.&quot; 
<br />

<br />
And then, Uncle Chuck gave him a hug, and they walked back to his
<br />
garden.  Charles picked up the cage (after commenting on its handiwork
<br />
positively) and wandered over to a neighbors' house and borrowed a small
<br />
burlap bag.  Then, he carefully dropped the contents of the cage into the
<br />
bag, and put the wooden construction down.
<br />

<br />
After that, he signaled for a PeaceBot via a special watch he had on his
<br />
arm for that purpose, and gave it some very specific instructions on what
<br />
to do with it.  The PeaceBot beeped in compliance, took the bag carefully,
<br />
and zipped off to parts unknown.
<br />

<br />
He'd remembered hearing Uncle Chuck tell him later that the rabbit was 
<br />
released on a different part of Mobius, where it wouldn't eat anyone's 
<br />
garden up.  He smiled when he remembered that Uncle Chuck had always been 
<br />
proud of him for never killing anything, and that he'd promised never to...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
But, if he didn't kill Snively, he could escape from whereever they'd put him, 
<br />
and return to Robotropolis.  Then, he'd keep hurting people and destroying
<br />
things and doing things that were Way Uncool.  Maybe he'd get lucky and
<br />
kill one of his friends.  Maybe he'd even kill Sally!  Or him!  Then,
<br />
something or other would cause Joseph to NOT make a deroboticizer, and
<br />
everyone who'd been roboticized would die...Uncle Chuck...
<br />

<br />
No, Sonic thought, he'd have to break his promise.  The cycle had to end.
<br />
If he didn't, too many more lives would be put in jeopardy.  He had the
<br />
chance, and he had to make the most of it.  
<br />

<br />
&quot;It would be,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;a pleasure.&quot;
<br />

<br />
With a fluid movement, he grabbed the semi-unconscious Snively by the 
<br />
collar, and threw him against the wall.  He punched him a few times in the
<br />
stomach, yelling and cursing at him the whole time.  He'd occasionally
<br />
shout out, &quot;This is for--&quot;, nail Snively in the face, and then yell a 
<br />
name of a FF, friend, or just some innocent person who had been killed 
<br />
or roboticized.  
<br />

<br />
After a while, Sonic began to sense that Snively was just about to buy it.
<br />
He knew if he was going to complete what he had started, he had an
<br />
obligation to make it impressive.  Then, he knew what he had to do.
<br />
He curled up into a ball on the ground, and started to power up a 
<br />
Sonic Spin Dash Attack...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The rest of the FFs around arrived there seconds later.  Dulcy had returned
<br />
home, with the last load of citizens they'd get that night.  Antoine had
<br />
also been taken home as well, because he was just too mental at that time
<br />
to even join the rest of them to find out what had happened to Sonic and
<br />
Joseph.  So, just Bunnie, Sally, and Charles arrived at the scene.
<br />

<br />
Needless to say, they were surprised that Snively was nearly dead on his
<br />
feet, and his large nose (not to mention the rest of him) looked all bloody
<br />
and bruised.  However, they were more surprised to see Sonic getting ready
<br />
to do a Sonic Spin Dash Attack right into him!
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
<br />

<br />
Charles knew he had only seconds to act.  While the rest of them were simply
<br />
struck dumb with shock, he rushed toward Sonic and shouted &quot;STOP!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The shout distracted the hedgehog just long enough for him to slow down
<br />
to a low enough speed so Charles could rush into him to knock him over.  
<br />
&quot;No, Sonic!&quot;
<br />

<br />
This was one of the times Sonic was simply struck speechless.  He tried to
<br />
form a complete sentence explaining why he was about to kill an Enemy of
<br />
the State, that it was worth a life to save a million others, etc, but he
<br />
simply could open and shut his mouth and make the articulate conjunction, 
<br />
&quot;Uhh...&quot;.
<br />

<br />
But Charles was far more verbal.  &quot;Sonic, it is not for you to decide who
<br />
lives or dies!  I don't care if Snively *has* nearly destroyed this world,
<br />
and I wouldn't care if Robotnik was in the same position Snively is in!
<br />
Killing is wrong!  It would make you no better than Robotnik to destroy
<br />
this pitiful creature!&quot;  He pointed at the area that Snively was occupying.
<br />
&quot;We will take him back to Knothole, and--&quot;
<br />

<br />
But when he, and everyone else who had been intently listening to Charles, 
<br />
turned to look at the spot he was pointing at, he was gone!
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Sonic broke the silence with &quot;Oh, man...&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Where'd the smeg he'd go?&quot; Joseph said.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Never mind that,&quot; Sally said, &quot;we better get out of here before he finds
<br />
out where the...uh...smeg WE went!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Agreed,&quot; Charles said nervously, &quot;we can discuss this back at Knothole in
<br />
the morning.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic, silently damning himself for blowing it, let everyone join hands,
<br />
each person linking to another in a chain, and grabbed the last link in the
<br />
chain, Sally.  He looked back, checked that everyone was attached, and took
<br />
a ring from his backpack.
<br />

<br />
He looked at Joseph, but said nothing.  Joseph understood his silence, and
<br />
spoke softly.  &quot;No, Sonic, I'll run interference,&quot; he said to the blue (in
<br />
more ways than one now) version of his body, &quot;You just get everyone 
<br />
safely back to Knothole.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The hedgehogs nodded, and Sonic fired up the ring, albeit grimly, 
<br />
and took off out of Robotropolis.  Distant lazer fire was heard seconds
<br />
later, but none of it seemed to hit its mark, as usual.
<br />

<br />
However, Joseph chose to stay behind not to run interference, but to get
<br />
the rock that he had taken out of Snively's weapon.  He grabbed it from the
<br />
backseat of the idling hovercraft, and examined it closely for the first
<br />
time.  Within seconds, he realized exactly what it was; Snively had somehow
<br />
gotten the Amber Chaos Emerald from somewhere.  He didn't even want to
<br />
guess, tho.  What was important now was that he had it, not him.  
<br />

<br />
He was already thinking of all the good ways he could use it when lazer
<br />
fire started raining toward him.  SWATBots!  Now he was in `the deep
<br />
merde', as Antoine might have called it.  He quickly turned on the hedgehog
<br />
drive, and zipped away at a rapid pace.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, a familiar figure was tapping some buttons on Robotnik's chair,
<br />
and ordering various SWATBot batallions out to capture the stone from the
<br />
orange hedgehog...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Joseph dodged the lazer fire as best he could.  He wondered how Snively had
<br />
recovered so quickly.  Or perhaps this was an automatic program in case of
<br />
the injury of either Robotnik or Snively.  He didn't know, and didn't care
<br />
a whole lot at the moment, either.   
<br />

<br />
He tried to devise a plan of escape.  If he could get free of Robotropolis
<br />
proper, then he could lose the 'bots in the maze of garbage.  The only
<br />
problem was that there were a LOT of SWATBots left, and Joseph couldn't
<br />
stop to fight them, or risk the Chaos Emerald falling back into Snively's 
<br />
hands.  
<br />

<br />
He continued to dodge some 'bot plane fire and the pursuing platoon of 
<br />
SWATBots.  He was able to trick one of them into flying into a wall, and
<br />
another by splitting it in twain on the corner of a building.  But there
<br />
were still a lot of them around!  And they were *gaining* on him!
<br />

<br />
Quickly, he knew he had to really throw on the speed, or be overtaken by
<br />
the SWATBots.  But how?  He didn't have a power ring or anything.  He
<br />
certainly couldn't fly away; he had neglected to bring his antigrav belt.
<br />
Returning fire was right out because he was plasma cannonless.  And
<br />
surrendering meant death.
<br />

<br />
Then, he remembered the glowing Chaos Emerald he had in his hand.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sonic had told him a week or two ago how he fired up a power ring.
<br />
&quot;It's like...well, imagine having a chili dog in your right hand.&quot;
<br />
He lifted up his hand to demonstrate.  &quot;Now, imagine the dog's chili and
<br />
sauce starting to run over your hand.  That's the energy from the ring.
<br />
Now, you certainly can't *eat* the power ring...it'd blow off your jaw.&quot; 
<br />
He smirked.  &quot;Besides, they don't taste very good.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He lifted his empty hand higher in the air, like he'd hold a power ring in
<br />
his hand.  &quot;Now, try to imagine the chili starting to run down your arm,&quot;
<br />
he said, starting to trace the path with his left hand. &quot;tingling over 
<br />
your forearm, elbow, and finally all the way to your armpit.&quot;  He paused to
<br />
let this sink in, and moved on.  &quot;After it's covered your arm, imagine the
<br />
flow of chili starting to move down your ribs, becoming stronger after
<br />
jumpin' over each one.  After that, have it fall down your stomach, and
<br />
finally have it dribble down your leg.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic resumed a more relaxed posture.  &quot;After that, your body should
<br />
probably take over.  It's reflex to me, but you should be able to do it
<br />
right one day.  It's a Way Past Cool feeling, like you're a big blue--&quot; 
<br />
He smirked.  &quot;--well, orange, in your case.  A big, orange lightning bolt.&quot;
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
And if that could be done with a power ring, he thought...
<br />

<br />
As Joseph ran, he began to lift the emerald above his head, in his right
<br />
hand.  He imagined the chili dog....
<br />

<br />
The figure in the chair watched the orange hedgehog lift the emerald above
<br />
his head, seeming to begin some sort of meditation ritual.  The figure
<br />
wondered what the hedgehog was trying to do.
<br />

<br />
As he began to visualize the chili dog beginning to drip down his hand, the
<br />
emerald began to glow brighter and brighter...seeming to power up for
<br />
the occasion.
<br />

<br />
The person in the chair was entranced by the brighter-glowing emerald. 
<br />
Could it be that a Chaos Emerald could also be used as a power source for
<br />
organic beings?
<br />

<br />
Down his arm....and the emerald's light went from orange to yellow to green
<br />
to blue to indigo to violet and beyond in under a second.  &quot;Wow,&quot; Joseph
<br />
said, and continued to visualize the chili dog exercize.
<br />

<br />
The figure quickly kept up with the emerald's frequencies, altering the
<br />
scanning units to counter.
<br />

<br />
He imagined the power flowing down to his ribs, lapping over each one.
<br />
The emerald was now giving off strong x-rays.  This was beginning to
<br />
frighten him.  But he could not stop.  Even if there weren't any SWATBots
<br />
chasing him, the feeling was intoxicating.  He was high on the sheer amount
<br />
of power he had in the palm of his hand.
<br />

<br />
The figure was glued to the screens.  The level of power from the emerald
<br />
was far higher than had ever been calculated in such a small crystal.  
<br />
It could be even more powerful than the total collective energy from the
<br />
Mobian sun...
<br />

<br />
When the energy rolled onto his stomach, the crystal started giving off
<br />
gamma rays.  If it wasn't for the fact Joseph's body was designed to be
<br />
spaceworthy, it would have instantly killed him.  This led him to the
<br />
conclusion that only he would be able to safely use the emerald in this
<br />
way.  Of course, he was too busy trying not to fly into a dead end to mull
<br />
that thought over further.
<br />

<br />
The figure was passionately awaiting what would happen next.  The SWATBots
<br />
had almost steered the hedgehog right into a dead end, where'd he either
<br />
stop, or become a greasy spot on a wall.  Either way, he'd get what he
<br />
wanted.  He laughed at the simplicity of it all...
<br />

<br />
Joseph kept running.  The final stage of powering up must take the longest,
<br />
he noted, and ran down an alley.  
<br />

<br />
Oh no.
<br />

<br />
The alley ended in a wall.  There wasn't enough room to turn around.  The
<br />
SWATBots were pursuing him, and were now firing at him with extreme
<br />
prejustice.  
<br />

<br />
The power hit his legs.
<br />

<br />
The wall stretched before him now, and in one second he'd--
<br />

<br />
All reality snapped away in one blast of light.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
The figure in the control room screamed, and pounded his fists against the
<br />
armsrests.  No!  That was impossible!  Nobody could bend reality!  How?!
<br />
Why?!  He couldn't think of an answer, which even made him madder, and just
<br />
contented himself with screaming, and bludgeoning things.
<br />

<br />
The hedgehog had powered up the crystal to a level that his instruments
<br />
couldn't even measure, been surrounded by an ultra-powerful version of
<br />
Sonic's usual nova effect, and shot *through* reality.  The wall had
<br />
literally bent IN, and he had blasted through it.  A second later, the wall
<br />
had normalized, like nothing had even happened, and his platoon of SWATBots
<br />
slammed into it, destroying them instantly.
<br />

<br />
The night had been a tour de' force by the Freedom Fighters.  They'd not
<br />
only gotten about 25% of the remaining Worker-Bots out of Robotropolis, but
<br />
they'd destroyed a few good refinaries and somehow (and the figure had no
<br />
explaination for this) downloaded the sum of the main computer's knowledge.
<br />

<br />
That fact just made him madder.  And the figure didn't even have a Chaos
<br />
Emerald left to experiment on, to boot!
<br />

<br />
However, even this horrid experience had an upside.  He smirked
<br />
unpleasantly as he turned the chair around, toward a slab in the back of
<br />
the room.  The figure looked over at the unconscious form of Snively, who
<br />
occupying the slab, and was plotting a way to give Snively a very, 
<br />
VERY unpleasant surprise when he woke up....
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Meanwhile, back at the ranch:
<br />

<br />
Everyone had arrived back at Knothole but Joseph.  The night's activity had
<br />
exhausted the Freedom Fighters, and they still had to instruct the new
<br />
rescuees on basic procedure.  But that could wait until the morning.
<br />
They gave all who needed it temporary lodging somewhere, reunited as many
<br />
families as possible, and put the rest of the village to sleep.
<br />

<br />
Two hedgehogs, however, were still awake.  They sat by the Power Ring pool,
<br />
staring out at the ripples that formed in the water.  Occasionally, one of
<br />
them would skip a rock over the surface of the liquid, attempting to break
<br />
the tension.
<br />

<br />
After a while, one of the hedgehogs spoke.  &quot;Sonic?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic nodded.  &quot;Yeah, Unc?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Do you want to talk about this now?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Hesisitation.  &quot;Well, if you want to.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles coughed.  &quot;Yes, I do.&quot;  He paused.  &quot;I'm not angry at you, boy. 
<br />
Not in the least.  If I had been in your place, and Joseph had given me the
<br />
option, I would have done the same thing.  It was just that I didn't expect
<br />
you to think of doing that...&quot;
<br />

<br />
He sighed.  &quot;In retrospect, I suppose killing Snively might have been a
<br />
feasible option; seeing that he escaped somehow.  However, I still feel it
<br />
would have been morally wrong to do so, no matter how evil he is.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic put his face in his hands.  &quot;I'm confused.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles put his hand on the hedgehog's shoulder.  &quot;Boy, so am I.  These
<br />
kind of situations are always the worst.  This war....god, this war...it's
<br />
starting to take its toll on you kids.  I wouldn't wish the position you've
<br />
been in on Robotnik.  All this death.  I'm surprised you didn't crack
<br />
earlier; you've had the opportunity countless times, when you could have
<br />
just killed Robotnik and/or Snively, and ended it.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic mumbled, &quot;It was because...because I would have endangered others if
<br />
I woulda killed 'BUTT-nik or Snotley in those situations.  Yeah, I coulda 
<br />
spin-dashed 'BUTT-nik open, and finished off Snively a few times, but I
<br />
always had to save someone else, or stop a berzerk machine from destroying
<br />
somethin' important.  This time, I had a Way Past Clear shot, and I knew I
<br />
might not get another.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles nodded.  &quot;Sonic, it's okay...everyone is entitled to act on impulse
<br />
occasionally--&quot; 
<br />

<br />
Sonic stood up and angrily pointed to himself.  &quot;But I let you down!  
<br />
I became as bad as Robotnik when I got pumped up to kill!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles' eyes glowed a surprised red.  &quot;You certainly did not!  Your father
<br />
would have done the same thing, and he was the finest man I ever knew!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic's resolve fell as Charles said this.  &quot;H-he would?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes, he would have.  Your father was so much like you, boy, that I
<br />
sometimes have to remind myself not to call you by his name.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic dazedly sat back on the ground, and stared back over the water.  
<br />
&quot;Everything's gone crazy.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles scooted closer to Sonic, and gave him a hug.  &quot;It will be right
<br />
again some day, boy.  It will.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic whimpered softly, and let his head fall upon Charles' shoulder.
<br />
&quot;But what if I go crazy like that again?  What if I lose control, and--&quot;
<br />

<br />
Charles comforted the confused hedgehog.  &quot;You won't.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Nothing more needed to be said.  Nothing more could be said.  All that was
<br />
left for Charles to do was to hold his nephew in his arms, watch the sun
<br />
rise in the east, and make him right again...
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
It was the gap between realities.  It had been called the `Void' by some,
<br />
`Creation' by others.  But it was everywhere and nowhere, at alltime and
<br />
notime.  It was the universal nexus, where all dimentions combined.
<br />
This is where Joseph found himself after breaking through the alley wall.
<br />

<br />
He drifted through nothingness for a moment while the emerald idled down.
<br />
It took an incredible strain on him, but he was able to return the mighty
<br />
object to orange status again.  He felt weak, and he so wanted to sleep...
<br />

<br />
He saw the floating crystal `iceberg' a few miles....feet....inches? 
<br />
Length, width, height, volume, mass, location; they meant nothing here.
<br />
Everything was as close as anything else in this strange semi-universe.
<br />
Either way, he drifted for some period of time before finally pulling
<br />
himself onto it.
<br />

<br />
He looked around.  There was a small crystalline home here.  He wondered
<br />
what else could survive in this odd omnispace...he walked over to the door,
<br />
and knocked upon it a few times.  A voice.  &quot;Hold on, Nagus, I'm coming.&quot;
<br />
So there were at least two other people here, he thought, and stepped a
<br />
polite distance away.  The door opened.
<br />

<br />
He looked at the figure.  He was dressed in a outfit that looked like it'd
<br />
seen better days.  It was kind of ratty, and there were stains on the
<br />
lapels from what looked like a few years of dinners.  Yet, it appeared to
<br />
have once been regal, and it denoted authority.  The figure was tall for a
<br />
Mobian fox, about 4' something rather than the usual 3'.  He had a
<br />
tarnished, dented crown on, and his eyes gave the impression he'd been to
<br />
Hell and back again on several occasions.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You aren't Nagus,&quot; he said, evaluating the strange creature.  &quot;Who are
<br />
you?  How did you get here?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph bowed.  &quot;Greetings, citizen.  I am Joseph.  I seem to have ran a
<br />
hole through the time/space continuum.  Would you have any idea how to
<br />
leave this strange world?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;That depends,&quot; he said, intrigued.  &quot;Where did you come from.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Mobius, specifically around Robotropolis.  Time 'round 3237.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure was surprised.  &quot;Oh?  Well, I'm from Mobius too.  In fact,
<br />
I'm--&quot; 
<br />

<br />
&quot;Look,&quot; Joseph interrupted, &quot;excuse my rudeness, but it's vital I get back
<br />
to Mobius before my friends start panicking and go back to Robotropolis to
<br />
look for me.  You understand, right?&quot;
<br />

<br />
The figure looked a bit hurt, but quickly got over it.  &quot;Yes, yes, of
<br />
course.  Now,&quot; He pointed to a bluish hole on the horizon.  &quot;go over to
<br />
that hole, and run through it as fast as you can.  And KEEP running through
<br />
it.  After a minute, you'll pop out in the Great Unknown.  The Great Forest
<br />
is to the east.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Joseph nodded.  &quot;Thanks, citizen!&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Please,&quot; the figure smiled, &quot;just call me Acorn!&quot;
<br />

<br />
While running off, Joseph smiled, and yelled back, &quot;Sure, Acorn!  See you
<br />
some other time!&quot;  With that, he fired up the crystal, and shot through the
<br />
hole as fast as he could.
<br />

<br />
As the figure zoomed out of sight, King Acorn smiled.  &quot;Oh, you will,
<br />
orange one.  You will.&quot;  Then, he walked back into his hut, and closed the
<br />
door quietly behind him, leaving no evidence of any activity there at all.
<br />

<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />

<br />
Snively groggily awoke on the cold, hard steel plate in the back of the
<br />
semi-operational control center.  He pulled himself to a sitting position,
<br />
and hopped off the uncomfortable table.  He rubbed his head.  The hedgehog
<br />
had beaten the crap out of him.  He wondered how or why he had either
<br />
escaped from them, or was rescued...
<br />

<br />
He walked over to the wall-intercom, and pushed the button.  &quot;Please send
<br />
some aspirin up to the command center, anyone.&quot;  It beeped, noted the
<br />
order, and set to work delivering it.
<br />

<br />
He walked over to the drink dispenser and poured himself a cold glass of
<br />
water.  Chugging it rapidly, he felt some of his memory returning....
<br />

<br />
He'd been tottering on his feet while Charles was yelling at Sonic for
<br />
attempting to kill him, with the unknown orange hedgehog looking on.
<br />
Then, someone had snuck up behind him and roughly grabbed him, pulling him
<br />
into the shadows.  He remembered someone ordering a SWATBot battalion out
<br />
to capture the Freedom Fighters--
<br />

<br />
&quot;Hello, Needlenose!&quot; a too-familiar voice shouted.
<br />

<br />
Uh-oh.
<br />

<br />
He turned around to look for the source of the voice, and saw someone he
<br />
did NOT want to see.  He screamed upon recognizing the evil features of...
<br />
Commander Packbell?!
<br />

<br />
&quot;Miss me?&quot;
<br />
