<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aunt Bunnie! Aunt Bunnie!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was sitting in her hut, writing. She heard Tails call her and 
<br />
she went to look out her window. &quot;What is it, Tails?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor needs your help! He said he needed to lift something heavy in 
<br />
his workshop, and he wanted me to get you.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Be right there, sugar!&quot; Bunnie smiled, and went outside.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Rotor's workshop, Sonic, Antoine, Dulcy, and Sally were 
<br />
awaiting Bunnie's arrival.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie opened the door to Rotor's workshop and stepped in. All was 
<br />
quiet. Bunnie turned to ask Tails if he'd seen anything, but he had 
<br />
disappeared. She stepped in further.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor?...Tails?...Are y'all in here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SURPRISE!!!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was shocked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic came up to her and put his hand on her robotic shoulder. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Happy Birthday Bunnie!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My stars! I thought everyone forgot about it!&quot; Bunnie exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How could we forget your Sweet Sixteen?&quot; Sally smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have made you a cake, Bun-nie. It ees zee famous &quot;Cake de Antoine&quot;!
<br />
Antoine grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie began to cry. &quot;I can't believe y'all went to this trouble!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't cry!&quot; Dulcy exclaimed, &quot;We haven't even opened the presents!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry.&quot; Bunnie sniffled. Tails came up to Bunnie and handed her a 
<br />
good sized box.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Open mine first!&quot; Tails barked happily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sure thing, sugar!&quot; Bunnie said as she started to open it. Inside the
<br />
box she found a device.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's a journal, Aunt Bunnie,&quot; Tails explained, &quot;Now you don't have 
<br />
to write with a pen. All you have to do is talk to it and it prints out what 
<br />
you say!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, Tails, hon! How'd you make this?&quot; Bunnie wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Aunt Sally's been teaching me some things.&quot; he smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Bunnie! Open my present next!&quot; Sonic interrupted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay, sugarhog.&quot; Bunnie grinned as she teared the paper off of the 
<br />
flat object. Inside was a beautiful painting of all the Knothole Freedom 
<br />
Fighters, clustered by the sliding tree.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, Sonic! This is beautiful!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I do have other occupations other than being a Freedom Fighter.&quot; the 
<br />
blue hedgehog grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She opened Dulcy's next. It was a display of her first expedition 
<br />
when she was twelve.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you Dulcy!&quot; exclaimed Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No problem.&quot; the dragon said, flapping her wings.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally stood up. &quot;This next present is from Rotor and me.&quot; she said as 
<br />
she handed a small box to the cybunny.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside the box was a replica of Nicole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Her name is Sarah. She has many of the programs Nicole has, plus a 
<br />
few more. She talks in English' too...Try her out!&quot; Rotor smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gosh...what should I ask?&quot; Bunnie whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ask her to display a picture of Robotropolis.&quot; Dulcy replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sarah, I'd like to see a display of Robotropolis.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a voice not as low as Nicole's, she spoke. &quot;One moment, Bunnie.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly a display of Robotnik's paradise was shown.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oooh...I could get to like this!&quot; Bunnie giggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It also has a telecommunicator. This way, if we need to go on a 
<br />
mission together, we can still keep in contact.&quot; Sally smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last was Antoine. &quot;Ta-dah! Zees is a copy of zee recipe book handed 
<br />
down in my familee. I want vou to have eet!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine...I don't know what to say...&quot; the rabbit smiled and went up 
<br />
to Antoine and kissed him on the cheek. He blushed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oooh! Well! Would you like a copy as well, my preencess?&quot; Antoine 
<br />
grinned hopefully towards Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe another time Antoine.&quot; she rolled her eyes.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After everyone was finished they ate Antoine's cake. They danced and 
<br />
sang songs sung by the citizens of Mobotropolis many years before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty soon, everyone was in his or her own hut and fast asleep. 
<br />
Night had seemed to have come much faster when they were having fun.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was awoken by the cooing of the messenger bird, summoned by 
<br />
Uncle Chuck. She called for the bird and it landed on her windowsill. She 
<br />
opened the container on it's leg and read the note.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my stars!&quot; she gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie ran over to Sally's bed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wake up, Sally-girl!&quot; the rabbit exclaimed as she lightly tapped the 
<br />
sleeping princess' shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was up in a second. &quot;Bunnie, what's wrong?&quot; Bunnie handed her 
<br />
the note.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally's eyes fled over the paper.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my gosh!&quot; Sally gasped. She and Bunnie then got dressed and ran 
<br />
to Sonic's hut. Bunnie decided to take Sarah with her. A groggy hedgehog 
<br />
opened the hut's door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic!&quot; Bunnie cried, &quot;Robotnik wants to make me his queen!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic lit up. &quot;WHAT?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck just sent us this letter, it explains everything.&quot; Sally 
<br />
told him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Bunnie?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know...&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly Bunnie's legs and arm emitted a soft yellow glow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wh-what's happening to me?&quot; Bunnie cried. It was then when she ran 
<br />
out of the hut towards the meadow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally ran after her.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie!&quot; Sonic yelled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Help me Sally! I can't control my legs!&quot; she wailed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had caught up next to Bunnie and would've grabbed her, but he 
<br />
remembered that her robotic parts gave her the strength she had, and Sonic 
<br />
didn't want to mess with that power.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What could be causing this, Sal?&quot; Sonic asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Maybe, when the roboticization process took place, a homing device 
<br />
was planted in Bunnie. It didn't function until now, when Robotnik wanted 
<br />
her.&quot; Sally explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, you're sayin' that ol' Bullethead planted something in Bunnie?&quot; 
<br />
Sonic translated.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Exactly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Then how do we get rid of it?&quot; Sonic questioned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know. One thing I do know, is that we should see Uncle Chuck 
<br />
as soon as we can. He'd know more about this than we do.&quot; Sally replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;But what about Bunnie?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll let her go into Robotnik's domain, and I'm sure that's where 
<br />
she's headed, and we'll have her play robot with Robotnik himself and then 
<br />
we'll take her off.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Just hope he doesn't do a brainscan, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what I hope.&quot; Sally then yelled towards Bunnie, &quot;Bunnie! 
<br />
We're letting you go to Robotnik. You'll be safe, don't worry. Anyway he 
<br />
want's you there. What I want you to do though is to keep contact with us 
<br />
through Sarah, but you have to act as if you're under mind control with 
<br />
Robotnik You've got it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll try Sally-girl. Just promise y'all will bring me back soon.&quot; 
<br />
Bunnie told the two as she ran towards Robotropolis.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Freedom Fighter's Honor, Bunnie!&quot; Sonic grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We'll be back Bunnie! I Promise.&quot; Sally reassured her, and with that,
<br />
Sonic and Sally headed off to Uncle Chuck.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So, do you know anything on this, Sir Charles?&quot; Sally asked, politely.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why, yes. I remember, before Sonic brought me to reality, an urge to 
<br />
take me back to Robotropolis whenever I had strayed. Especially that time I 
<br />
tried to kidnap Antoine and little Tails, it was really strong then. Let me 
<br />
run a certain program I created on installations and programmings of the 
<br />
roboticization process. I wrote everything that could possibly happen when an 
<br />
individual is being roboticized.&quot; Uncle Chuck then proceeded to tap around 
<br />
the keyboard for a second before finding what he needed. A big display was 
<br />
shown on the monitor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whoa! Mondo complicated, Unc!&quot; Sonic exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Entirely, but this is what we need to know.&quot; Uncle Chuck explained. 
<br />
Sally ripped out Nicole and had her copy the entire file.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;File copy completed, Sally.&quot; she said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll try to find out more about Robotnik's plans, but now I have to 
<br />
get back to my station. They'll suspect of something if I'm not there.&quot; Uncle 
<br />
Chuck turned to his nephew, &quot;I love you,Sonic.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I love you too, Unc...C'mon, Sal'! It's time to get loose and juice.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bye, Uncle Chuck. Thank you.&quot; Sally smiled as she hopped in Sonic's 
<br />
arms. In a half-second they were out of there.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah...&quot; sighed Robotnik, &quot;It worked.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie droned her voice and stared into nothingness. &quot;Awaiting orders,
<br />
sir.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I will not be giving you any orders, my dear girl. You...will be my 
<br />
queen.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie cringed on the inside upon the thought of having to live with 
<br />
Robotnik the rest of her life.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Snively spoke up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sir, shall I do a brainscan on her?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No need Snively, the device has done it's job. Take her to the 
<br />
holding cell. There we will have her spruced up.&quot; Robotnik explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Contacting Escort, sir.&quot; replied Snively.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good,&quot; thought Bunnie, &quot;They think I'm brainwashed. Sally will be 
<br />
glad to hear that.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two Swat-bots then picked up Bunnie by the arms and took her to her 
<br />
cell.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic reached the main entrance to the Death Egg in about three 
<br />
seconds. Sally let go of Sonic's shoulders and messed with the control panel 
<br />
located to the side of the door. In a minute the doors opened. Sonic grabbed 
<br />
Sally and rushed into an open air vent. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they found themselves over the holding cells.  Sally removed the 
<br />
vent cover and jumped inside an empty cell. With the door open, they began 
<br />
their search for their friend.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back at Knothole, Rotor was becoming restless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy, where could they be?&quot; he asked the dragon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Beats me, Rotor, but as long as Sonic's with them I wouldn't count 
<br />
on any trouble.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I zeenk they abandoned us!&quot; Antoine exclaimed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Get real, Tony!&quot; Dulcy scolded.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wish Sonic had told me about it, I would've gone.&quot; Tails muttered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon Tails, I'll play air tag with ya!&quot; Dulcy tried to cheer up the 
<br />
little cub.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay.&quot; he said, and he and Dulcy flew off.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside her holding cell, Bunnie was being dressed by Swat-bots into a 
<br />
very ugly red, yellow, and black dress. The bots were finally finished with 
<br />
her preparations and left the cell. Bunnie waited a good minute or two to 
<br />
pick up Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sarah, locate Sally and link up the communication mode.&quot; Bunnie 
<br />
whispered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Locating...individual found. Setting up communication.&quot; droned Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally were passing the western cell blocks when Sally 
<br />
received the message.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie! Are you alright?&quot; exclaimed Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Couldn't be better Sally-girl. It's just this dress looks 
<br />
disgusting!&quot; Bunnie replied.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I must admit, Robotnik does have bad taste!&quot; Sonic intervened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie heard the hedgehog. &quot;Hiya sugarhog!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hang in there Bunnie, we're almost there.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Okay--Oh my stars! Someone's coming.&quot; Bunnie gasped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The transmission was lost.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, we've got to do something.&quot; Sally persisted.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait a Sonic Second...&quot; Sonic thought for a moment, &quot;...Yeah! C'mon 
<br />
Sal, we're outta here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where are we going?&quot; Sally questioned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Trust me.&quot; was all that Sonic said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I hate it when you say that...&quot;
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, my queen.&quot; Robotnik said as he watched Bunnie standing there 
<br />
holding Sarah, &quot;You've duped us all.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I wonder why it was so easy, you cottonball!&quot; Bunnie snapped.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh but it wasn't...for you see, &quot; he paused dramatically, &quot;I heard 
<br />
your whole conversation with the Princess.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You didn't think I wasn't cautious, did you? You see, all the cells 
<br />
are built with tiny microphones installed in the walls. That way, no prisoner 
<br />
can plan their escapes out loud.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What if they don't talk?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's what these are for.&quot; Robotnik said, pointing to a 
<br />
surveillance orb floating above him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're gonna pay for this Robotnik!&quot; Bunnie threatened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't see how. I can only wonder why your little friends' haven't 
<br />
arrived yet. Have they abandoned you?&quot; 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In your dreams, butterball.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik turned to his two Swat-bots. &quot;Take her away.&quot;
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic arrived at Knothole in three seconds. He then proceeded to tell 
<br />
the Freedom Fighters what had happened to Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's horrible! Not even a day after her birthday and she's being 
<br />
tortured.&quot; cried Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'll come with you Sonic, you might need my help.&quot; Dulcy said.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm coming too!&quot; barked Tails. Sally began to hesitate but quickly 
<br />
realized that Tails was now one of the Freedom Fighters. Officially.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Dulcy, you take Sally and Tails. Rotor, I'm gonna need your help.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Whatever you say Sonic.&quot; Rotor smiled.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *   
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in the Death Egg, Robotnik's Swat-bots were leading Bunnie to 
<br />
the Roboticizer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let me go, you wire-brains!&quot; Bunnie struggled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly Sonic burst into the room with Rotor on his shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE! HEDGEHOG PRIORITY ONE!&quot; droned the Swat-bots 
<br />
and dropped Bunnie on the floor. Rotor ran and picked her up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nice dress, Bunnie.&quot; Rotor smirked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten more bots filled the room and began to chase after Sonic. Sonic's 
<br />
plan was to lead the bot patrol to outside towards Dulcy where she would 
<br />
blast them away with a breath of fire. Rotor's job was to take a dummy of 
<br />
Bunnie, place it in the Roboticizer, and activate it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie quickly got out of her dress and put it on the dummy.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Robotnik's really gonna be steamed when he finds this in my place!&quot; 
<br />
Bunnie smiled.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ol' chrome dome won't know the difference until he comes in to check 
<br />
on you.&quot; Rotor explained.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie paused as Rotor pushed some buttons on the Roboticizer, &quot;Say, 
<br />
sugar, who's plan was this anyway?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails'.&quot; replied Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie smiled. &quot;He's all grown up, isn't he?&quot;
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside Dulcy was finishing off the remainder of the bot patrol. 
<br />
Tails and Sally were working on destroying the power generator.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We need to shut it down, then Dulcy can destroy it.&quot; Sally told 
<br />
Tails as he stood next to the grid-interlock.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails then set to finding the password to shut down the system.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Got it, Aunt Sally!&quot; barked Tails, proudly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good job honey! This should shut down Robotnik for a few days!&quot; 
<br />
Sally smiled.
<br />

<br />
*    *    *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Roboticizer remained on-line, due to a back-up generator. Inside, 
<br />
the dummie was ready and roboticized. Bunnie and Rotor had already left when 
<br />
Robotnik showed up.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ah, I see we're--&quot; Robotnik gasped, &quot;Where in the-? SECURITY! Search 
<br />
the area! I want that girl!&quot; Robotnik stood there, steaming, &quot;When I do find 
<br />
her, she'll pay greatly before I roboticize her...&quot;
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Rotor and Bunnie were escaping, Rotor decided ask Bunnie some things.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Do you have any idea why he wanted you as a queen?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm not sure, but I think it has something to do with my strength. 
<br />
Either that, or he would have tried to emotionally scar Sally.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good point. Man, Robotnik sure pick the wrong rabbit to mess with!&quot; 
<br />
smiled Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sugar, I bet you say that to all the girls!&quot; Bunnie blushed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon they were outside and Sally ran up to her best friend.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie! I'm so glad you're okay!&quot; Sally smiled and gave Bunnie a hug.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suddenly swarms of bots surrounded everyone.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh no!&quot; gasped Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned to his little fox friend. &quot;Wanna help me kick some 
<br />
bot-butt?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah!&quot; he smiled and flew into the air.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic thrashed through the ground patrol, while Tails eluded the sky 
<br />
patrol into running into each other, smashing them to the ground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotor, Sally, Bunnie and Dulcy took this time to escape.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When most of the bots had vanished, Sonic motioned for Tails to come 
<br />
down and land. Doing so, Tails grabbed onto Sonic's shoulders and then they 
<br />
were out of there.
<br />

<br />
*   *   *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh my stars, that was the most peculiar thing that cue-ball has ever 
<br />
done!&quot; gasped Bunnie as she sat with her friends by the ring pool.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're right, Bunnie. I've never seen anything so stupid in my life. 
<br />
He's got Snively, what else does he need?&quot; Sonic grinned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Taste, sugar, definately taste.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They all laughed.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rotor, there's one thing I wanna ask you.&quot; smiled Bunnie,&quot;Do you 
<br />
really think that he messed with the wrong rabbit.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Of course.&quot; said Rotor.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Thank you, sugar. To this cybunny, that compliment meant a lot.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In what way?&quot; asked Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, I just feel helpless and all, with me bein' partially 
<br />
Roboticized. I need a good compliment every once and a while. It's weird 
<br />
being different. As a matter of fact, I don't know why he didn't choose a 
<br />
normal girl.&quot; replied Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie, you are normal. It's not your appearance that matters.&quot; 
<br />
Dulcy piped in.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie paused for a moment and then looked up at Dulcy. &quot;You're right 
<br />
sugar-dragon.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We all love ya.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was startled to hear this. It hadn't come from Sonic, Sally, 
<br />
Rotor, Dulcy, or Tails. It had come from Sarah.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What the hoo-haw is goin on here?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally giggled. &quot;I told Nicole to make her say that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally-girl! You scared the hair off me! For a second there, I 
<br />
thought that Sarah here was alive!&quot; laughed Bunnie.
<br />
All was well in Knothole.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE END!
<br />

<br />
