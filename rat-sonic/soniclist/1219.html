<br />
A tip of the ol' freedom fighters' fedora to JOHN W. JOHNSTON
<br />
for supplying summaries for issues 1-15 plus 17:
<br />

<br />
#1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Meet Me At The Corner of Hedgehog and Vine!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: M. Gallagher; art: D. Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of Robotnik's SWATbots develops a mechanical plant
<br />
called &quot;Krudzu&quot; and modifies a Burrobot to plant its seeds in the
<br />
Great Forest.  Antoine, depressed because Sally only pays
<br />
attention to Sonic, decides to get her a bouquet of flowers.  He
<br />
gets caught by the Krudzu, Sonic saves him, and they discover
<br />
that the Krudzu is not waterproof.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You Bet My Life!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boomer/Rotor discovers that Robotnik is making a big
<br />
presentation in the Casino Night Zone.  Sonic crashes the party,
<br />
only to be subdued by Robotnik's newest baddie: Orbinaut.  He is
<br />
put in a giant pinball machine and sent through a very rough
<br />
ride.  When he escapes from the pinball machine, Sonic blows up
<br />
the casino and puts Robotnik into orbit.  [Notes: Apparently the
<br />
casino was rebuilt for &quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot; (#16); the
<br />
pinball (Spinball?) plot was used to better effect later on in
<br />
the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode of the TV series; Rotor was still being
<br />
called &quot;Boomer&quot; at this time.  DJD]
<br />

<br />
#2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Triple Trouble&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik sends his newest badnik, Coconuts, after Sonic and
<br />
Tails.  When they send Coconuts' parts back COD, Robotnik sends
<br />
two more badniks, Scratch and Grounder, after Sonic.   [No, this
<br />
has no relation to the Game Gear game.  It does, however, set up
<br />
the characters from the syndicated TV series. DJD]  
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Vertigo A Go Go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is out collecting rings when he warps into an
<br />
extremely warped zone where he meets two friends, Al and Cal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All The Mail's About Tails&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher (rewrite)/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails read letters from fans who expressed their
<br />
opinions about how Tails got his two tails.  One theory was: one
<br />
of Tails' ancestors was owned by Charles Dickens (A Tails of Two
<br />
Cities).  Another theory was that Tails was a mutant (and
<br />
couldn't get a job with the X-Men).  Another theory says he was a
<br />
loss leader at a carnival freak show.  Another theory says he was
<br />
one of Dr. Frankenstein's creations.  Another theory says that
<br />
Tails has Antoine's tail (and hair).  And another theory involved
<br />
something dealing with evolution.  [C.f. FAQ File question #1 on
<br />
the subject]
<br />

<br />
#3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Bomb Bugs Me&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic informs Sally and Boomer/Rotor that Robotnik has &quot;the
<br />
bomb.&quot;  To trick Robotnik, they project a picket line on a wall
<br />
outside his office.  Boomer/Rotor disguises himself as Robotnik
<br />
to trick Crabmeat into giving &quot;the bomb&quot; to the freedom fighters,
<br />
but this plan backfires when Robotnik shows up dressed in a
<br />
Boomer suit.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Boomer/Rotor travel to the Southern Section of
<br />
Mobius (Sonic pulling Boomer who wears inline skates).  They come
<br />
across two SWATbots who have thrown a captured rabbit into a
<br />
portable roboticizer.  They are delayed in rescuing her because
<br />
they are &quot;tied up.&quot;  They finally shut down the roboticizer and
<br />
take it and the half rabbit-half robot with them.  When she
<br />
recovers, she gives her name as Bunnie Rabbot and demonstrates
<br />
her abilities.  Meanwhile the forest above Knothole is being
<br />
trashed by a giant burrobot.  When Sonic gets zapped, Bunnie
<br />
picks up the burrobot and throws it 50 meters.  Sonic then traps
<br />
the burrobot by burying it.  [This represents the first attempt
<br />
to explain the origins of Bunnie.  Since then, both fanfic and
<br />
professional efforts -- Teitelbaum's second book: Robotnik's
<br />
Revenge -- have covered the same ground.  The situation is
<br />
complicated by the fact that Bunnie appears as one of the
<br />
children in &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; and so wouldn't be a stranger to
<br />
the Knothole Gang.  In fact, BttP, part 2 featured a tease of
<br />
Bunnie about to be roboticized as a child.  Note also that
<br />
Knothole is still an underground base at this time. DJD]
<br />

<br />
#4
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Lizard of Odd!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to a roboticizer mishap caused by Buzzbomber, Robotnik
<br />
turns a small salamander into his most powerful badnik [No, it's
<br />
not Newt Gingrich!  DJD]: Universalamander.  When Sonic tries to
<br />
attack him, Universalamander eats Sonic.  Sonic escapes by making
<br />
&quot;Lizard Lips&quot; belch.  To defeat him, Sonic transforms into Super
<br />
Sonic, gets an important component from the confiscated
<br />
roboticizer [see above, &quot;Rabbit Deployment&quot;], and cuts
<br />
Universalamander down to size.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Little Tale&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic rests after defeating Universalamander, Tails
<br />
embarks on his first solo adventure.  Unaware of Tails, Robotnik
<br />
is in the middle of a company picnic.  [You're right, it DOES
<br />
sound lame! DJD]  Tails get plucked by Buzzbomber and Orbinaut,
<br />
but defeats both of them.  Tails gets overconfident and is
<br />
captured by two SWATbots making shadow-puppets.  When they try to
<br />
roboticize him, Sonic saves Tails.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
#5
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Olympic Trials and Errors&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decasare [debut]; Art: Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik challenges the freedom fighters to compete in
<br />
Olympic games.  If they win even one event, Robotnik &quot;promises&quot;
<br />
to restore Mobius; if they lose, they'll be turned into robots. 
<br />
Before the competition, a SWATbot switches Sonic's sneakers with
<br />
energy-draining shoes.  When Sonic drops on the track, the other
<br />
freedom fighters (except for Tails) take his place.  While Tails
<br />
is looking for materials to make a Sonic sculpture, he finds
<br />
Sonic's real sneakers and returns them to him.  [The synopsis
<br />
ends here; presumably, Sonic wins, Robotnik renegs, and it's back
<br />
to business as usual.  The linkage between Tails and sculpture
<br />
was repeated in &quot;That's The Spirit&quot; (#20). DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Chomp on This, Chump!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Sonic and Tails help Sally deal with a batch of extra-
<br />
thick pancake batter, Boomer/Rotor decides to buy a mail-order
<br />
ant farm.  What Boomer/Rotor doesn't know is that the farm he
<br />
receives came from Robotnik.  Instead of ants, Boomer/Rotor
<br />
receives a Termite-nator, a termite which eats wood and paper and
<br />
which grows as it eats.  Remembering Sally's pancake batter
<br />
recipe, Sonic whips up a batch and fills a hollow log with it. 
<br />
Boomer/Rotor returns the ant farm to sender. [What is it with
<br />
Rotor and ant farms?  He also had one in &quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom
<br />
Fighter&quot; (#23). DJD]
<br />

<br />
#6
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Spin Doctor&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the freedom fighters attack Robotnik's factory, they
<br />
find that Robotnik has relocated to deep within Mount Mobius, an
<br />
active volcano.  Sonic enters the Veg-O-Matic Fortress where he
<br />
is attacked by Rexxon and Scorpius.  After defeating them, he
<br />
runs into two allies, Hip and Hop, who warn him about the
<br />
Ferrons.  After Sonic trashes the Ferrons, he comes across a cell
<br />
full of animals awaiting roboticization.  Just as Sonic believes
<br />
he is on Robotnik's trail, he is shot out of the volcano, only to
<br />
be rescued by Tails.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic's Christmas Carol&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[The cast enacts You-Know-What by You-Know-Who -- if you
<br />
DON'T, better take a refresher course in English Lit. 
<br />
Significant in that they finally get the issue of Rotor's name
<br />
straightened out. DJD]
<br />

<br />
#7
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uncle Chuck's Treasure&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Rotor accidentally sends Tails through the roof
<br />
(literally), they find an old treasure map belonging to Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  They believe the &quot;treasure&quot; may be an invention that will
<br />
help them defeat Robotnik.  According to the map, the treasure
<br />
was buried in Mobius National Park; unfortunately, the park had
<br />
since been destroyed by being turned into a toxic waste dump. 
<br />
When the freedom fighters find the spot, Robotnik attacks.  Sonic
<br />
fights back using the toxic wastes, but Robotnik snatches the
<br />
treasure from them as soon as they dig it up.  Robotnik discovers
<br />
that the &quot;treasure&quot; is really Sonic's bronzed baby booties (try
<br />
saying THAT 3 times fast ;-) ).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorceress in Distress&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally dresses as a sorceress for the annual Fright Night
<br />
party, but needs a staff to complete the outfit.  She finds one
<br />
in the Forest and (due to a string of coincidences) believes it
<br />
to be real.  Robotnik sees the &quot;sorceress&quot; and, unaware that it's
<br />
Sally, drags her back to Robotropolis; object: matrimony! Sonic
<br />
follows them.  Robotnik wants to see a demonstration of the
<br />
sorceress's &quot;magic&quot; and Sally obliges, with a little help from
<br />
Sonic.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#8
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bot's All, Folks!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When Crabmeat is caught reading Sonic the Hedgehog comics,
<br />
Robotnik is inspired to build super-powered robots to attack
<br />
Sonic.  Sonic meets, and defeats, &quot;Botman,&quot; &quot;Wolvurkel&quot; (a
<br />
factory second sent by mistake), &quot;Spawnmower,&quot; &quot;Magbot--Freedom
<br />
Fighter Fighter,&quot; &quot;Captain Marbot&quot; and &quot;Mighty 'Bot.&quot;  [Furries
<br />
might have a hard time slogging through this story!  &quot;Wolvurkel&quot;
<br />
is apparently an amusing *homage* to Jaleel White, the voice of
<br />
Sonic in both the SatAM and daily syndie series.  DJD]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Little Music Goes A Long Way&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic finds an old guitar, and the rest of the freedom
<br />
fighters decide to form a band.  Robotnik hears the music and
<br />
decides to put a stop to it with a shrink ray.  While the Freedom
<br />
Fighters rummage through the Mobius Music Hall, Robotnik and
<br />
Snively shrink them.  Robotnik uses a Pest Buster vacuum to suck
<br />
up the shrunken Sonic, but before they can put him inside a
<br />
mobile roboticizer the shrink ray wears off and the freedom
<br />
fighters return to normal size.  Before Robotnik's reinforcements
<br />
can arrive, the freedom fighters use music to chase him out of
<br />
the hall.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#9
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Pseudo-Sonic!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a thorough analysis of Sonic's profile, Robotnik
<br />
builds his ultimate evil robot, &quot;Pseudo-Sonic.&quot;  Meanwhile, Sonic
<br />
is out picking flowers for Sally.  Unfortunately, he comes in
<br />
contact with some poison sumac and blows up like a balloon.  The
<br />
Pseudo-Sonic discovers Knothole and is about to reveal its
<br />
location.  Tails, dragging his tails on the ground, builds up a
<br />
static electricity charge and shorts out Pseudo-Sonic.  Sonic
<br />
tries to get back to Knothole but is apprehended by Robotnik. 
<br />
Bunnie slam-dunks Robotnik and helps cure Sonic's rash.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's the Point?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While looking for a birthday present for Sally, Sonic comes
<br />
upon a Mobian needle bird with a broken wing.  Sonic wants to
<br />
give it as a present, but Sally reminds him of other animals the
<br />
freedom fighters have brought back.  Meanwhile the needle bird,
<br />
dubbed Thorny, has eaten Sally's birthday cake.  Sally goes off
<br />
to replace the cake while Sonic goes to return Thorny to the
<br />
Great Forest.  Sally is caught by a mechanical tree; Sonic almost
<br />
suffers the same fate, but is rescued by Thorny.  Sonic then
<br />
rescues Sally while Thorny goes after Robotnik (who, needless to
<br />
say, was behind the mechanical trees).
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Revenge of the Nerbs!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While attempting to steal power from Robotropolis, the
<br />
freedom fighters are caught in a force field.  Before the
<br />
&quot;Robotropolis Good Neighbor Society&quot; can apprehend them, the
<br />
freedom fighters escape thropugh a hole in the ground dug for
<br />
them by a Nerb, part of an underground-dwelling race.  The king
<br />
of the Nerbs maintains that contact with surface-dwellers is bad
<br />
news, but their air vents and water supply are being threatened
<br />
by construction activity aboveground.  On their way to the
<br />
surface, they move from a Nerb tunnel to a Mobian sewer pipe. 
<br />
They come up to find Robotnik doing some excavating to build an
<br />
underground installation; they also find three Nerb prisoners. 
<br />
Sonic frees the Nerbs and directs Tails to escort them back
<br />
underground; Sonic then opens a line to the Mobius River,
<br />
flooding Robotnik's construction site.  The freedom fighters are
<br />
proclaimed Honorary Nerbs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'Twan With The Wind&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare/Art: Art Mawhinney [debut]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters use Antoine's hot air balloon to scout
<br />
out a suitable location for their picnic.  Two Buzzbombers attack
<br />
the balloon.  Robotnik learns of the picnic and decides to crash
<br />
it.  While everyone else is having fun at the picnic, Antoine
<br />
mopes about his balloon.  But when Robotnik attacks, it's up to
<br />
Antoine to patch up the balloon and come to the rescue.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Good, The Bad, And The Hedgehog&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders [debut]/Art: Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The freedom fighters witness Robotnik dumping toxic waste
<br />
into a river.  Sonic tries taking a &quot;short cut&quot; via the Cosmic
<br />
Interstate to get there, but winds up on an alternate Mobius
<br />
where Robotnik is a benevolent person and Sonic is a leather-clad
<br />
punk.  After a round-the-world chase, Sonic  captures the
<br />
Antisonic (c.f., &quot;When Hedgehogs Collide,&quot; #24) and the
<br />
AntiRobotnik devises a way to undo the toxic spill cause by
<br />
Robotnik.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Beat The Clock&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Manak
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Food For Thought, or, You Are What You Eat&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After scarfing a ton of chili dogs as a midnight snack,
<br />
Sonic dreams that everyone has turned into junk food: Sonic is a
<br />
chili dog, Sally is an ice cream cone, Tails is an order of fries
<br />
(regular), and they all confront Chef Ivo Robo-Burger.  The fries
<br />
get caught by Robo-Burger so chili dog goes to rescue him.  But
<br />
he slips on a banana peel and right before Tails gets deep-fried,
<br />
Sonic wakes up.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Timely Arrival&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gallagher/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik builds a time machine to get rid of Sonic by
<br />
transporting him to the past.  Sonic enters the trap and lands in
<br />
prehistoric Mobius.  There he meets Sonugh the Boghog, and the
<br />
caveman Ivo Robughnik.  Sonic also meets other prehistoric
<br />
freedom fighters, but they're all afraid of the surface because
<br />
it offers no cover [Sounds like they're still dealing with an
<br />
underground Mobius.  DJD].  Sonic finishes transplanting some
<br />
hedges near the entrance when he is pulled back to his own time
<br />
by the freedom fighters, who have confiscated the time machine.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While avoiding Robotnik in the Mobius Mountains, Sonic comes
<br />
across an old eagle, Cyril.  He tells Sonic how his flock was
<br />
roboticized and how he has lived in hiding.  Sonic convinces him
<br />
to risk flying, and he discovers that his flock still exists. 
<br />
Cyril returns the favor by rescuing Sonic when Robotnik attacks.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Lynx Is A Jinx&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While on a rescue mission, Sonic comes across a lynx named
<br />
Larry, a.k.a. Super Jinx.  He proves this when the branch of a
<br />
tree that he's sitting on gives way and injures some freedom
<br />
fighters on the way down.  The freedom fighters head back to
<br />
Knothole to nurse their wounds and Sonic tries to find a hiding
<br />
place for Larry.  When Sonic and Larry learn that the freedom
<br />
fighters have been captured, Larry is sent out to be captured by
<br />
the SWATbots who, in turn, suffer various misfortunes.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Tails discover a floating island, but their plane
<br />
is shot down by a rocket as they approach.  After landing and
<br />
enduring some hazards, they meet Knuckles the Echidna.  Thinking
<br />
that they have come to steal the island's Chaos Emerald, he gives
<br />
them a ten-minute head start before giving chase.  Meanwhile,
<br />
Robotnik, who planted the suggestion in Knuckles' mind, is
<br />
stealing the Emerald himself.  Knuckles discovers the theft and
<br />
Sonic recovers the Emerald.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to launch a space-based weapon, RoboStorm. 
<br />
This device will not only turn living beings into robots, it will
<br />
also jam all regular television broadcasts and replace them with
<br />
infomercials.  The freedom fighters learn of this and enter the
<br />
ship.  Robotnik appears, however, before they can do any damage
<br />
to the systems, so they blast off with Robotnik in pursuit.  They
<br />
crash-land on the moon Muckery.  Using the local materials (i.e.,
<br />
mush), they get the better of Robotnik.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Taste of Power&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails eats a piece of fruit he finds growing in Rotor's
<br />
greenhouse.  This fruit, from the Mobian Tree of Wisdom, makes
<br />
Tails into a super-genius.  Sally and Bunnie are attacked by a
<br />
giant Shredbot.  Tails avoids the bot's blades in such a way that
<br />
the bot self-destructs.  He goes off to face Robotnik, just as
<br />
the effects of the fruit begin to wear off.  Sonic bluffs
<br />
Robotnik with a medal which Tails gave himself earlier.

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to capture Sally and Bunnie in a booby-

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Rockin' The Bot!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While out running with lightning, Sonic spies a frog in
<br />
trouble.  For rescuing it, the frog gives Sonic three magic
<br />
stones: a green one for super strength, a yellow one for leaping
<br />
great distances, and a red one for elasticity.  Since Sonic
<br />
doesn't believe the frog, he gives the stones to Tails. 
<br />
Robotnik, in a Beetlebot, attack the freedom fighters while
<br />
they're out testing an all-terrain vehicle.  Robotnik throws a
<br />
boulder at Sonic while he's holding the red stone; Sonic is
<br />
flattened but resumes his shape.  Sonic tries attacking the
<br />
Beetlebot but (having forgotten which stone does what) he is
<br />
holding the yellow stone -- he beats the Mobius high-jump record
<br />
but accomplishes little else.  Using the green stone, Sonic
<br />
crafts a giant flyswatter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Mawhinney

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Rotor works on a top secret project, the rest of the
<br />
gang recall previous experiments that have gone awry.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Animal Magnetism&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decesare/Mawhinney
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik plans to use a giant Magnabot to capture Bunnie and
<br />
use her as bait to get the other freedom fighters.  During an
<br />
outdoor barbeque, Bunnie (and everything else metal) is suddenly
<br />
pulled away.  Sonic hitches a ride to the Magnabot by grabbing a
<br />
metal garbage can lid.  Sonic then tricks Robotnik into
<br />
increasing the power and Snively into pointing the Magnabot
<br />
toward Robotropolis.  Rotor coats Bunnie's robotic parts with an
<br />
anti-magnetism compound to keep it from happening again.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gorilla Warfare, or, The Apes of Wrath&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kanterovich &amp; Penders/Manak
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik travels to Skoal Island and finds one of his
<br />
original bots: King Gong, a ten-foot tall, 800 lb. gorilla.  He
<br />
sends the big ape to Mobotropolis to attack Sonic.  King Gong
<br />
breaks up a freedom fighters' picnic, but loses interest in Sonic
<br />
when he sees Sally.  With Sally in his grasp, he climbs to the
<br />
top of a minimall to watch the sunset.  The Sonic Spin has no
<br />
effect on King Gong, so it's on to Plan B: while Tails flies up
<br />
to rescue Sally, Sonic and Antoine hose him down with banana oil.
<br />
King Gong slips and falls on top of Robotnik.

<br />
================================================================
<br />

<br />
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
question; the replies were printed in issue #2 (&quot;All The
<br />
Mail's About Tails!&quot;).  Theories range from transplantation to
<br />
mutation.  The latest entry is in the Sonicgram of #22.  They
<br />
state that Tails just happened to be born that way--with no other
<br />
comment (thus illustrating the difference between an Explanation
<br />
and an Answer).  At this point, there is no &quot;official&quot;
<br />
explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're pretty much
<br />
free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer the theory
<br />
that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution of Mobius.
<br />
This would accord with the fact that Tails had not been born when
<br />
Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine D'Coolette . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.  As for the designation &quot;ground squirrel/chipmunk&quot;, which
<br />
has been questioned by at least one correspondent, I entered it
<br />
this way on the assumption that the two terms were synonymous.  I
<br />
have consulted a dictionary, which states that the term &quot;ground
<br />
squirrel&quot; applies to several kinds of rodents, including the
<br />
chipmunk genus _Tamias_.  Given the present ambiguity, the
<br />
designation will remain as is.
<br />

<br />
Despite this, controversy continues.  Identifying Sally's species
<br />
has been particularly vexing to some fans, especially those who
<br />
reason that since Sally's father is clearly a fox, then she must
<br />
be one herself.  It is possible that Sally takes after her mother
<br />
in this regard more than her father.  Cross-species mating is a
<br />
definite possibility, and an example is implied in the
<br />
&quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot; [Sonic: In Your
<br />
Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified as far back as the beginning
<br />
of the comics [Sonic Miniseries, #0, Mar 1993].  Technically,
<br />
royalty do not have surnames or family names in the accepted
<br />
sense; rather, the title of the personage tends to serve the
<br />
purpose.  Her middle name, Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf.
<br />
&quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part 1).  If you wanted to be grandiose
<br />
about it, Sally's formal title would be: Sally Alicia, Princess
<br />
of the House of Acorn.  But in any event it's unlikely that
<br />
Sally's formal title will come back into use so long as Robotnik
<br />
is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
At one point, Sally's age is explicitly given as being 16,
<br />
though the comics reportedly put both Sally and Sonic at age 15. 
<br />
Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the number of years Robotnik has
<br />
been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would appear that Tails was born
<br />
after the fall of the House of Acorn.  Still, the simplest way
<br />
out of this dilemma would be to put the age of majority on Mobius
<br />
at 17 instead of 18; that would eliminate the extra year
<br />
differential without altering the stated ages of Sonic and Sally
<br />
(in the comics) or of Tails (in &quot;Drood Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened with the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character, but its
<br />
introduction was delayed--a situation acknowledged in the
<br />
SonicGram of #21.  The story actually began with &quot;Deadliest of
<br />
the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The cover art for the miniseries,
<br />
however, differed in subsequent advertisements: one cover for the
<br />
first issue prominently featured Geoffrey St. John, while another
<br />
did not.  The third issue cover either does or doesn't feature
<br />
Sally doing battle with a clone of herself, depending upon where
<br />
you see it.  Two different versions of the cover for #2 appeared
<br />
in Sonic #22.  The fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie
<br />
Comics PLUS Sega reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot;
<br />
the series (as reported in Sonic #21 -- hence the delay) would
<br />
seem to indicate that someone had come down with a case of
<br />
&quot;creative differences.&quot; In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally
<br />
miniseries began shipping the week of Feb 13, after a slight
<br />
delay.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Q8: Does anyone have a theory about Sonic's speed?
<br />
A: How, in other words, is Sonic able to run so fast?  Apparently
<br />
the same way you get to Carnegie Hall in the old joke: practice. 
<br />
I'm serious; here is the only print explanation I've come across
<br />
so far: &quot;Years ago, when things were right on Mobius, there lived
<br />
a hedgehog named Sonic....  Sonic was only interested in running
<br />
as fast as he could.  Every day he practiced.&quot; [Michael
<br />
Teitelbaum, _Sonic the Hedgehog_.  Mahwah, NJ: Troll, 1993, pp.7-
<br />
8].  And that's the extent of Teitelbaum's explanation.  Thanks a
<br />
heap, Mike!  Chris Baird may be onto something, and it looks like
<br />
he wants to force the issue by asking Archie Comics about &quot;The
<br />
rumor going around the Internet that [Sonic] got his speed from
<br />
falling into a vat of power rings when he was a baby.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Q9: Why didn't ABC renew Sonic for a third season?
<br />
A: There are now three answers to this question -- one appears to
<br />
be definitive, but the other two are more fun.  Believe what you
<br />
like:
<br />
1) ABC got clobbered in the SatAM ratings of the November sweeps
<br />
because the show was up against the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers
<br />
on Fox.  Despite the fact that ABC shifted Sonic to an earlier
<br />
time slot (doing so without warning just before the first airing
<br />
of the &quot;Doomsday&quot; episode), Fox jazzed with its schedule so that
<br />
MMPR was once more up against Sonic.  This 1-2 punch was enough
<br />
to do it.  Source for this item: someone from within the offices
<br />
of Archie Comics, as posted to alt.fan.sonic-hedgehog.
<br />
2) DiC allegedly screwed the pooch by releasing StH animation
<br />
cels onto the market without clearing it with Sega.  Upon
<br />
learning of this, Sega took umbrage that its property was being
<br />
sold without its consent or agreement to a cut of the action (can
<br />
you say &quot;anal retentive&quot;?).  Words were exchanged and the show
<br />
was effectively cancelled.
<br />
3) ABC's kidvid programming has lately been adhering to a policy
<br />
of &quot;two seasons and out&quot; for shows.  Though it's possible that
<br />
some ideas only last two seasons because they're kinda bankrupt
<br />
to begin with.
