<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I am of the mind set that Mobius (and the whole Sonic story) is a social
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; commentary of what we, the intelligent species known as humans, are doing
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to our beloved planet.  That makes this a very politically correct cartoon
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; which reflects us as a society.  That is what almost all cartoons are -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; reflections of ourselves.
</em><br />

<br />
That's because all cartoons are made by _humans_. And as inhabitants of
<br />
Earth we can only refer to things we know, our society, our problems with
<br />
polluting the environment, our social structure and the like. Of course
<br />
everyone tries to make the world in the cartoons a little better and a
<br />
more interesting place to live than the world we know. That's because
<br />
there is magic in the cartoon or a society of different species that live
<br />
together in peace.
<br />

<br />
There have been a lot of postings about the location of Mobius. To my
<br />
opinion the best suggestion would be that Mobius is an alternate earth of
<br />
another universe/dimension, inhabited by intelligent animals instead of
<br />
humans. This would explain all the parallels in speech (English, France)
<br />
or food (Chili Dogs). And because it's an _alternate_ earth there can
<br />
also be magic there.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Another thing that makes me dismiss the idea of a future Earth is the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; HUGE improbability that many species on Earth could evolve from where they
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; are now into sentient beings in just under 2000 years, nuclear accident
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; mutations or not.  So far it's taken humans 2.5 million years!
</em><br />

<br />
That's the best reason to convince anyone that Mobius is no future Earth.
<br />
This suggestion sounded a little strange anyway...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And now for something completely tasteless...
</em><br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I wonder if Sonic has ever eaten any of his friends when he had chili
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; dogs.  Is that why we don't see Porker Lewis in the Archie comics?
</em><br />

<br />
Well, in the Furry comics I've read there are some animals that have
<br />
evolved into intelligent, human-like beings, but there are also others
<br />
that are just 'normal' animals (like chickens or cows). Maybe its the
<br />
same with Mobius.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I never could see a name, but a pig is in Sally's mini-series #1.  But of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; course Sonic isn't, except in the intro and the adverts.  And he could be
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; eating one of those artificial 'dogs where probably no one is quite sure
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; what the thing is made of.
</em><br />

<br />
There was also a pig in the Sonic mini-series #1 (one of the Royal Guards),
<br />
but that was one of Robotniks androids which had a self destruct mechanism
<br />
implemented. Sonic threw him out of Knothole just in time...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; But as long as you had to bring up a tasteless point....
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; He may just be eating those who were about to (for whatever reason)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; defect to Robotnik's side.
</em><br />

<br />
At least he should use lots of ketchup, then.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well in a few eppisodes they show Hot Dog stands.... and the chef who
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; serves Sonic is a pig. (This leads me to belive that Mobian chili dogs
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aren't made out of pork)
</em><br />

<br />
Or maybe they are cannibals? Freedom Fighters by day, ravaging beasts by
<br />
night... nah.
<br />

<br />
Take it easy
<br />

<br />
