&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. SONIC COMICS DESCRIPTIONS
<br />

<br />
[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />

<br />
Now, direct from the Great White North, Brad Clark summarizes the
<br />
original Sonic miniseries:
<br />

<br />
Issue 0
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Don't Cry For Me, Mobius&quot;
<br />
Story: Michael Gallagher, Art: Scott Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is chased by Dr. Robotnik.  After the chase, which
<br />
Robotnik loses, Sonic returns to Knothole where most of the main
<br />
characters are introduced for the first time.  (Note: Rotor is
<br />
referred to as &quot;Boomer.&quot;)  Antoine then announces that there is a
<br />
leak in Knothole (Knothole is located underground in this issue)
<br />
that is caused by Robotnik.  Sonic defeats Robotnik with a power
<br />
ring.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The Royal Family of Mobius&quot;
<br />
Takes place before Robotnik was in power and has Sonic and Uncle
<br />
Chuck running a chilidog take-out stand.  Robotnik destroys the
<br />
stand and captures Muttski and Uncle Chuck.  Sonic meets Sally
<br />
(with yellow hair and red fur) who introduces him to the rest of
<br />
the freedom fighters in Knothole.
<br />

<br />
Issue 1
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Run, Sally, Run&quot;
<br />
Story and art: Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally [this time with pink fur and black hair] goes to see
<br />
Robotnik about the return of her father.  Robotnik captures Sally
<br />
and almost throws her into the &quot;Robo-machine.&quot;  Sonic rescues
<br />
Sally only to discover that Sally had wanted to get caught in
<br />
order to gather information on the roboticizer, using some
<br />
special boots designed by Boomer/Rotor.
<br />

<br />
Issue 2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;A Crowning Achievement&quot;
<br />
Gallagher &amp; Shaw! again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally decides to wear the &quot;Crown of the Acorn Kings&quot; which
<br />
belonged to her father, but the crown is missing.  They discover
<br />
a robotic freedom fighter who tells them that Robotnik has stolen
<br />
the crown and has scattered its jewels (the four Chaos Emeralds)
<br />
throughout the land.  Sonic retrieves the emeralds and
<br />
Boomer/Rotor repairs the crown.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Issue 3
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic Flashback&quot;
<br />
Gallagher &amp; Shaw!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Robotnik recall when they were kids.  Uncle Chuck
<br />
invents the power rings.  Sonic and Robotnik have an argument,
<br />
and it escalates until Robotnik is constructing mechanical
<br />
monsters out of Uncle Chuck's appliances.  Sonic then wakes up --
<br />
it was all just a daydream -- and resumes being chased by
<br />
Robotnik.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Why Ask Spy&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic is made to look like a robot to trick Robotnik and to
<br />
destroy one of his factories.  In the process, Sonic discovers
<br />
Uncle Chuck and Muttski who have both been roboticized.  Sonic
<br />
destroys the factory.
<br />

<br />
[Summary by Erich Schulman]
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sonic Under Glass&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Sonic and Sally are tying the knot, having
<br />
defeated Robotnik once and for all.  In reality, Robotnik has
<br />
lured the freedom fighters to a place called Sleepy Hollow.  Once
<br />
there, they were gassed, put into a sleep, and trapped inside a
<br />
virtual reality glass dome.  As all their fantasies have come
<br />
true, nobody wants to escape.  Uncle Chuck arrives and reveals to
<br />
Sonic that he is embracing, not Sally, but a broom.  Sonic hates
<br />
to disappoint his friends, who are all so happy, but decides to
<br />
get back at Robotnik.  Sonic gets Robotnik's war machines to
<br />
reverse course and attack the big guy, so Robotnik reluctantly
<br />
kills the VR software.  Sonic and Sally are reunited, and Sonic
<br />
concludes that virtual reality is a nice place to visit, but....
<br />

<br />
&quot;The Man From H.E.D.G.E.H.O.G.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik comes to the conclusion that there is a spy in his
<br />
midst, since so many of his missions have failed.  Thinking that
<br />
he has found his spy in a mole, he uses the Wheel of Misfortune
<br />
to randomize his plans to destroy Mobius.  On Robotnik's first
<br />
spin, he lands on &quot;undersea bank heist.&quot;  Robotnik's lackey's
<br />
find only an empty vault and the freedom fighters waiting for
<br />
them.  The same thing happens after two more spins.  Robotnik
<br />
finally thinks he has Sonic captured when Sonic and Sally visit
<br />
Robotnik's casino [Boy, I hope this makes more sense in the
<br />
comic!  DJD], but Sonic narrowly escapes.  Belatedly, Robotnik
<br />
realizes that the Wheel itself was rigged.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic-Grams: Aside from now-obsolete announcements, it is
<br />
stated that Sonic is 15; that Sally is a squirrel (not
<br />
necessarily a ground squirrel); that Antoine was a donor so that
<br />
Tails would be able to fly [Yeah, right!]; that Sonic was just a
<br />
little slow rescuing Bunnie from the roboticizer.  On a more
<br />
useful note, Archie Comics confesses that due to inadequate
<br />
modelling information, their Sally was a different color from the
<br />
SatAM version, a situation which has since been rectified.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#18 [Jan 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
<br />
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
<br />
plans an attack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;
<br />
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
<br />
&quot;First Star....&quot;, #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
<br />
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
<br />
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork
<br />

<br />
Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally's Crusade: The Quest&quot;
<br />
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
<br />
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
<br />
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
<br />
spelled out in a &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of the story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mirror Zone&quot;
<br />
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as &quot;about 15.&quot;  [Note, if
<br />
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Tallest Tale&quot;
<br />
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
<br />
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.  Artwork by
<br />
Shaw!.
<br />

<br />
#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.  Artwork by Manak for the first half, Mawhinney for the
<br />
second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.
<br />

<br />
#20 [Mar 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.  Great line (Sonic to
<br />
Robotnik--who thinks he's dealing with a ghost): &quot;Give Mobius
<br />
back to the freedom fighters, lose weight and get a hairpiece!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;
<br />
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
<br />
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
<br />
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.
<br />

<br />
#21 [Apr 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;3 Phases of E.V.E&quot;
<br />
Pat Spaziante debuts as a story artist.  Robotnik unleashes
<br />
E.V.E. [&quot;exceptionally versatile evolvoid&quot;] to capture Sonic.  As
<br />
Sonic manages to outsmart E.V.E., it simply adapts to another
<br />
form to compensate.  Sonic lures it to Robotnik's headquarters
<br />
where, assuming a self-conscious form, E.V.E. determines that it
<br />
is being held back by its biological inheritance from Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik [i.e., individual cells used in E.V.E.'s creation]. 
<br />
E.V.E. toasts Robotnik, but thanks to some quick thinking by
<br />
Sonic--apparently, Sally's influence is rubbing off on him ;-) --
<br />
E.V.E. spares Sonic and travels out into space on a journey of
<br />
self-actualization.  Is Robotnik really history?  That's the
<br />
tease--stay tuned, probably until after the Sally miniseries.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
<br />
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.
<br />

<br />

<br />
#22 [May 1995]
<br />
&quot;The Return,&quot; written by Ken Penders, art by Pat Spaziante &amp;
<br />
Harvey M.
<br />

<br />
The story opens with Sonic &amp; Sally MCW (Married with Children;
<br />
cf. the end of &quot;Sally's Quest&quot; in _In Your Face #1_).  Sonic &amp;
<br />
Sally are out with the kids when, during a lightning storm, an
<br />
apparition of Robotnik appears and just as suddenly disappears. 
<br />
Have your pencils and scorecards ready to try and follow the
<br />
remainder of the plot: Robotnik is actually on a satellite
<br />
talking with Robo-Robotnik from &quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics,&quot;
<br />
(#19), only in this case only the consciousness of Robo-Robotnik
<br />
(hereinafter &quot;R-R&quot;) remains resident.  Robotnik convinces R-R to
<br />
teleport him back to Mobius, where it turns out Snively has
<br />
activated an alternative Doomesday device which would go off if
<br />
Robotnik was ever defeated.  Robotnik actually deactivates
<br />
&quot;Operation Wasteland&quot; himself to keep from being ruler over
<br />
nothing and to have the pleasure of saying to Sonic: &quot;You owe
<br />
me!&quot;  Robotnik and Sonic MWC are declared to be at a stalemate. 
<br />
What about R-R?  Who knows?  Muddled story saved by Spaziante
<br />
artwork.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Tails Knighttime Story,&quot; written by Angelo Decasare, art by Dave
<br />
Manak &amp; John Dagostino.
<br />

<br />
As Tails grumps about &quot;get[ting] baby-sat&quot; while Sonic has all
<br />
the fun and adventures, Sally tells him a bedtime story wherein
<br />
Sonic is Sir Runalot and Tails is his page who &quot;borrows&quot; his
<br />
armour one day and who, mistaken for the aforementioned knight,
<br />
ends up doing battle with Sir Knightmare of Robotannia (guess
<br />
who?) until the real Sir Runalot saves his...er...tails.
<br />

<br />
Sonicgram: the comics should get a FAQ File, since two letters
<br />
pepper them with questions (most are answered: &quot;Keep reading.&quot; 
<br />
Translation: &quot;we're working on it!&quot;).  The cover of Princess
<br />
Sally #2 in an ad on the same page differs from one which appears
<br />
on p. 17 of the same issue(!), thus bolstering the &quot;creative
<br />
differences&quot; theory in Q7.
<br />

<br />
#23   [Jun 1995]
<br />
&quot;Ivo Robotnik, Freedom Fighter&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
Sonic, Sally, Rotor, Tails, Robotnik and Snively are all captured
<br />
by Car-Heem, a giant alien who wants to study them.  In order to
<br />
save Robotnik from &quot;disposal,&quot; Sonic convinces Car-Heem that they
<br />
are interdependent species, a novelty to the autonomous Car-Heem.
<br />

<br />
Thanks to a diversion by Sonic, the others escape their
<br />
confinement in a craft of Robotnik's design.  Although Robotnik
<br />
blows Car-Heem and Sonic out of Car-Heem's spacecraft's airlock,
<br />
Rotor retrieves them.  In gratitude, Car-Heem returns everyone to
<br />
Mobius and Rotor, inspired, releases the inhabitants of his ant
<br />
farm [Heavy Message].  There's also a really bad pun which I'm
<br />
not going to reveal.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do-It-Yourself Sonic Contest winners announced.
<br />
&quot;Vol-ANT-teer&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Story: Angelo Decesare; Art: Dave Manak
<br />
Antoine ventures into Robotropolis alone to retrieve Tails' lost
<br />
backpack with a power ring in it.  Bunnie shadows him just in
<br />
case.  Surprising last panel gives the impression that Antoine
<br />
isn't exactly clueless.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Further indication that Knuckles will put in an
<br />
appearance in the next Sonic special, though no hint as to his
<br />
allegiance; look for an appearance by Knack the Weasel [c.f., the
<br />
Triple Trouble game] in the same issue.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
#24  [Jul 1995]
<br />
&quot;When Hedgehogs Collide&quot; (in 4 parts)
<br />
Script: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
Art: Dave Manak (Parts 1 and 2); Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski
<br />
(Parts 3 and 4)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part 1 is taken up witnessing antisocial behavior on the
<br />
part of Sonic, Sally, Tails, Antoine and Rotor.  Part 2 is the
<br />
exposition as to what's happening: Evil Sonic from &quot;The Good, The
<br />
Bad and the Hedgehog&quot; [Sonic #11] (hereinafter referred to as
<br />
&quot;the Antisonic,&quot; as in &quot;the Antichrist&quot;) is looking for some
<br />
action, so he rounds up the &quot;gang&quot; consisting of the Antisally,
<br />
the Antitails, the Antirotor and the Antiantoine.  They take the
<br />
Cosmic Interstate to Mobius, dress like their counterparts and
<br />
begin doing some damage.  So where have the Good Guys been all
<br />
this time?  Sonic, Tails and Antoine had been sent by Rotor into
<br />
&quot;negative reality&quot; though they were unable to penetrate &quot;the Zone
<br />
of Silence&quot; (aka, The Void) where Sally's father is being held. 
<br />
Sally's been out on a mission with the trainees (cf. the Sally
<br />
miniseries).  Everyone arrives back in time to incur the wrath of
<br />
their fellow Mobians.  In disguise, they come upon the gang about
<br />
to terrorize some more Mobians.  The first fight turns into a
<br />
draw until Sally realizes that there's no way they can defeat
<br />
their other selves, who would be able to anticipate their
<br />
strategies.  So it's &quot;Change partners!&quot; as play is resumed: Sonic
<br />
punches out the Antisally (this frame alone is worth the price of
<br />
admission!), Sally defeats the Antiantoine, Antoine stops the
<br />
Antirotor, Rotor defeats the Antitails, and Tails gets the better
<br />
of the Antisonic.  Since the Antisonic got what he came to Mobius
<br />
for (a fight), the gang agrees to return to their homeworld
<br />
peacefully.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the ol' doppelganger plot device worked so well in
<br />
Sonic #11 they decided to dust it off and run it past us again. 
<br />
A valiant effort marred by two Plot Holes and a Serious Omission:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#1: If Sally could figure out that fighting themselves
<br />
would get them nowhere, wouldn't the Antisally have reached the
<br />
same conclusion?  Then again they might have spent the entire
<br />
issue second-guessing each other....  ;-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PH#2: On the homeworld of the Antisonic the SWATbots do all
<br />
the work and &quot;kindly ol' Robotnik is a grade-A wimp!&quot;  At least,
<br />
according to an exposition by the Antisonic.  This then leads us
<br />
to...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SO: Where's Bunnie?  Despite a &quot;Sonic + Bunnie&quot; graffiti
<br />
carved into the desk of the Antisonic [along with &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sally,&quot; &quot;Sonic + Nicole&quot;--THAT I'd like to see!--and &quot;Sonic +
<br />
Sonic&quot;], Bunnie's legion of fanboys will be disappointed to learn
<br />
that she doesn't put in an appearance in this comic, either as
<br />
Bunnie or as the Antibunnie.  If indeed Robotnik is more
<br />
benevolent on the Antisonic's homeworld, does that mean that
<br />
Bunnie would be intact (i.e., not partially roboticized) there? 
<br />
Interesting question but one that Kanterovich and Penders
<br />
conveniently sidestepped for the moment.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGram: information on two upcoming &quot;special&quot; issues: the
<br />
48-page Sonic &amp; Knuckles special will include a solo Knuckles
<br />
effort and a lead story involving Knuckles' floating island, and
<br />
the &quot;Silver Anniversary&quot; issue #25 featuring Mecha Sonic from the
<br />
CD game (artwork by Spaziante).  There's a list of &quot;Do-It-
<br />
Yourself Sonic Contest&quot; winners who have moved and left no
<br />
forwarding address.  Two fan letters to Knuckles, plus word that
<br />
Tails will have his own miniseries coming out in the fall.
<br />

<br />
Sonic &amp; Knuckles 48 page special
<br />
(based on summaries by James Firmiss)
<br />
&quot;Panic in the Sky!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mobians living on the western shore of &quot;the Great
<br />
Continent&quot; [you'd think that Mobians would have come up with
<br />
another adjective besides &quot;Great&quot;: viz.: the Great Forest, the
<br />
Great Swamp, the Great Unknown, etc.  See also the &quot;all-purpose&quot;
<br />
use of the word _hriar_, or &quot;thousands&quot; by rabbits in Richard
<br />
Adams' _Watership Down_.  But I digress....] are alarmed by the
<br />
approach of a floating island.  Sally and the gang realize that
<br />
the island is on course for Knothole; Sonic explains to the group
<br />
(for the first time!?) that he and Tails were on the island a
<br />
while back and met Knuckles.  Antoine flies Sonic and Tails in
<br />
the turboprop, dodging antiaircraft fire from the underside of
<br />
the island.  After landing on the island, seeing giant mushrooms
<br />
and avoiding some traps, Sonic falls into one trap and again
<br />
meets Knuckles.  Since this is the second time Sonic has been
<br />
caught trespassing, Knuckles is about to send him over the edge
<br />
of the island.  Tails tries dropping a rock on Knuckles from
<br />
above to avoid this from happening, but it ends up that Tails has
<br />
to rescue both Sonic and Knuckles by airlifting them to safety.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It appears that Robotnik is &quot;hijacking&quot; the island by
<br />
somehow draining the energy from the Chaos Emerald which keeps
<br />
the island afloat.  Already having established a presence on the
<br />
island, Robotnik has installed weapons on the underside and plans
<br />
to use the island as a flying fortress to attack Knothole. 
<br />
Knuckles won't allow the island to be used this way; he smashes
<br />
the Chaos Emerald.  With the island losing altitude, Robotnik
<br />
abandons it, expecting that it'll still smash into Knothole
<br />
(though how he suddenly knows of Knothole's location is unclear).
<br />

<br />
But Knuckles replaces the &quot;real&quot; Chaos Emerald just in time--I'd
<br />
tell you how he switched it with a phony one which was the one he
<br />
broke, but I don't understand it either. Knuckles turns down an
<br />
invitation to join the Knothole gang; part of his stewardship of
<br />
the island now involves disarming it since Robotnik is gone.
<br />
&quot;Fire Drill&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Knuckles investigates an explosion on the island, suspecting
<br />
that it's Sonic.  Catching just a glimpse of an intruder, he
<br />
follows him to places unfamiliar even to him(!).  As the trail
<br />
leads off the edge of the island, he still thinks it's Sonic;
<br />
however, we catch a glimpse of a shadowy presence still on the
<br />
island.  Could be a Chaotix character, could be Nack the Weasel,
<br />
check out the Sonic-Gram in issue #23 for a hint.
<br />
&quot;Lord of the Floating Island&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While patrolling the island on a windy day, he spots a lost
<br />
joey (baby kangaroo) names Bengy.  The kid asks Knuckles to bring
<br />
back the sky; Knuckles explains that there's an eclipse in
<br />
progress and that's what's causing the winds.  They avoid a pack
<br />
of (biped) dingoes as Knuckles goes into further exposition about
<br />
the island-- how it's a paradise which some parties (Sonic and
<br />
Robotnik) want to change.  They eventually find Bengy's mom. 
<br />
Knuckles' exit line: &quot;This is my island!  And I live to protect
<br />
and serve!&quot;  The entire story appears to exist to supply needed
<br />
exposition and to nudge Knuckles closer to the Good Guy category.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No SonicGrams, but announcements: Sonic #25 will have a
<br />
silver ink cover and feature Mecha Sonic; dated August '95.  Also
<br />
slated for that month: a Sonic Triple Trouble 48-page special
<br />
featuring Nack the Weasel; it will also include a Sonic v.
<br />
Knuckles story, a Knuckles solo story, and a Tails solo story. 
<br />
Another 48-page special -- Knuckles Chaotix -- is schedules for
<br />
November '95.  Solo Knuckles stories will appear in Sonics #31-33
<br />
(Feb-Apr '96) and a Knuckles 3-parter will begin Jan '96.

#25
<br />
&quot;Go Ahead...Mecha My Day&quot; (the only story in this issue)
<br />
Story: Mike Gallagher
<br />
Art: Pat Spaziante
<br />
based on summary by James Firmiss
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a bow to the CD game, the story focuses on the freedom
<br />
fighters' discovery of the Collision Chaos Zone, a &quot;zone portal.&quot;
<br />
Robotnik tries to lure Sonic into the zome portal by kidnapping
<br />
his #1 fan: Amy Rose, the pink hedgehog (remember her?).  Based
<br />
on her dialogue on page 14, I'd describe her in Foghorn Leghorn
<br />
terms: &quot;Nice kid, but about as sharp as a sack full of wet mice.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Tails investigates from the air and is captured instead.  To
<br />
rescue both Amy and Tails, Sonic must race through the new zones
<br />
and do battle with Robotnik's Mecha-Sonic.  Spaziante's artwork
<br />
of Sally in this issue is surprising, in that her shape has
<br />
gotten...well, more shapely.  I don't remember her having that
<br />
much of a bustline in issue #21!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still no SonicGrams; another repeat announcement of the
<br />
Triple Trouble and Chaotix specials, as well as the Knuckles and
<br />
Tails miniseries.  Also staff artwork.
<br />

#26 [Sep 1995]
<br />
&quot;Way, Way Past Cool&quot;
<br />
Script: A. Decesare; Pencil: D. Manak; Ink: J. D'Agostino
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic, Tails, Sally, Rotor and Antoine find themselves in a
<br />
snowstorm...in the middle of summer.  Of course it's a plot by
<br />
Dr. Robotnik: after lowering the temperature on Mobius, he will
<br />
use infrared heat sensors to locate the warm-blooded freedom
<br />
fighters.  Sonic and the gang take shelter (such as it is) in a
<br />
cave, where they encounter a group of polar Mobians--they were
<br />
trapped down south when Robotnik took over and have lived in
<br />
hiding ever since.  After initially attacking the Weather
<br />
Annihilator with a snowball-loaded catapult, the Knothole gang is
<br />
captured by Snively.  The polar Mobians, however, come to their
<br />
aid and Sonic destroys the Annihilator.  The polar Mobians return
<br />
north to their home, inspired to put up more of a resistance.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This story has inspired renewed argument over species
<br />
identification since one of the polar Mobians [Erma, presumably
<br />
an ermine] looks something like Sally.  However, Erma doesn't
<br />
have the white winter coat associated with a true ermine, nor is
<br />
her tail long and tipped with black, nor is her body long and
<br />
slender.  But, hey, we're talking design by Manak here!  Wadja
<br />
expect?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional problems/flamebait: Where did the catapult come
<br />
from?  If Sally decided not to wear a vest because of the summer
<br />
heat, how come she's still got her boots on? [Then again, I'm
<br />
convinced that furries are Not Clear On The Concept when it comes
<br />
to clothing].  And why is Sonic shown skittering across the
<br />
surface of a river in the story's opening when the character
<br />
guide to Sonic clearly states that Sonic is a non-swimmer and
<br />
would ordinarily avoid water?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fan art
<br />
&quot;Fortified&quot;
<br />
Story: A. Decesare; Pencil: A. Mawhinney; Ink: R. Koslowski
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Knothole gang (the cast of the above story PLUS Bunnie!)
<br />
are in the mountains, trying to keep ahead of Robotnik--not easy,
<br />
since Sonic has a sprained ankle.  Bunnie discovers an old fort,
<br />
complete with an old muzzle-loading cannon and a blacksmith's
<br />
forge.  Robotnik's &quot;bus&quot; crashes into the fort, only to confront
<br />
Bunnie, suited up in improvised body armour.  She takes out
<br />
Robotnik's SWATbots and maneuvers the bus to crash through the
<br />
fort wall and roll back down the mountain.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FINALLY an appearance by Bunnie! [One has to wonder whether
<br />
her (largely out-of-the-way) role in &quot;Vol-Ant-eer&quot; in Sonic #23
<br />
even counts as an appearance.]  Mawhinney, though, seems to draw
<br />
her a little on the &quot;squashed&quot; side.  After Spaziante's rendering
<br />
of Sally in Sonic #25, I wonder how *he'd* draw Bunnie.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SonicGrams: In-house humor featuring Fulop, Mendez, Pepitone

<br />
the upcoming StH Triple Trouble special issue will feature Tails
<br />
in a Sea Fox submarine solo story, by way of warming up for the
<br />
Happy Fun Fox miniseries in the fall.  Question about why the
<br />
SWATbots carrying out Operation Wasteland in Sonic #22 went after
<br />
Robotnik and Snively [DJD: What part of &quot;total destruction&quot; don't
<br />
you understand?]; a fan from Canada complains about Bunnie's
<br />
seldom appearing in the comics [DJD: Hear! Hear!]; fan letter for
<br />
Tails from Cleveland.  Also cover art for #27 and the Triple

Princess Sally Mini-series #1 [April 1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Summary by Ron Bauerle
<br />
&quot;Deadliest of the Species!&quot; written by Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken
<br />
Penders, art by Art Mawhinney &amp; Rich Koslowski.
<br />

<br />
Opens with a nice splash page summarizing the struggle so far and
<br />
describes the main characters (get this: &quot;Antoine is renouned for
<br />
his military skills&quot; - okayyyy...).  Next it recaps Sally's
<br />
meeting Geoffrey St. John...in StH #20.
<br />

<br />
Sally &amp; Geoffrey are attacked by SWATbots after destroying the
<br />
facility and manage to beat them off [hey, Ron, let's leave their
<br />
private lives out of this ;-) ] and exchange some banter in the
<br />
process (I can't call it friendly but it's not really sarcastic
<br />
either).  They then head back to the camp where some young
<br />
trainee freedom fighters are waiting for Sally.  Geoffrey
<br />
mistakes them for enemies and jumps a pig (Hamlin) but they're
<br />
separated by Sally.  This establishes some bad blood between
<br />
Hamlin and Geoffrey that continues all issue.
<br />

<br />
The team proceeds to its next target (an energy substation) and
<br />
after battling SWATbots and ORBbots manage to destroy it.  During
<br />
the battle Geoffrey saves Hamlin's life but Hamlin still doesn't
<br />
trust him.  That night, when everyone else is asleep, Geoffrey
<br />
slips away, activates a teleportal, enters some kind of building
<br />
and descends to its basement where he speaks to a figure in a 
<br />
glass case: Sally!?
<br />

<br />
Also some fan art: two pics of Sally &amp; Bunnie (both NBD), and one
<br />
of Sally as a dominatrix (!).
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Princess Sally Miniseries #2
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Summary by Erich Schulman): The story opens with a fight
<br />
between St. John and Hamlin, and Sally gives Hamlin a scolding. 
<br />
To reach the third, undestroyed substation, the freedom fighters
<br />
use a new (!?) technology: hang gliders.  Arlo's hang glider is
<br />
hit by the defenses and he is wounded in action; Penelope
<br />
volunteers to stay with him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once inside, Sally and St. John are attacked by an octopod,
<br />
and everyone barely manages to escape the explosions.  Upon
<br />
leaving, they find that Sally and Penelope are gone.  Sally says
<br />
they will return to camp without them (to which Hamlin is
<br />
opposed), and they never show up again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have your doubts about St. John?  That night, St.
<br />
John replaces Sally with a lookalike robot and delivers the real
<br />
Sally to Robotnik.
<br />

<br />
Fan mail (singular; only one letter appears):
<br />
Will Sonic and Sally marry? &quot;Could be.&quot;  Has Sally met Knuckles?
<br />
She will in a forthcoming 48-page S&amp;K special.  Does Sally have a
<br />
mother, and if so what does she look like? &quot;Of course...her
<br />
origin may yet be told.&quot;  Or [shameless plug] you can read about
<br />
it in &quot;Bloodlines&quot; in the fanfic section of Rotor's homepage.

&quot;Deadliest of the Species, Part III&quot;
<br />
Story: Mike Kanterovich &amp; Ken Penders
<br />
Art: Art Mawhinney
<br />
(Summary: James Firmiss)
<br />

<br />
(Recap of parts 0, 1 and 2 omitted)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally, Hamlin and Dylan are fighting their way into
<br />
Robotropolis with paint guns and grenades (blinding SWATbots). 
<br />
Dylan believes that attacking at half strength isn't wise, yet
<br />
they press on.  Hamlin nearly falls from a collapsing catwalk but
<br />
Sally rescues him.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They eventually reach their objective, break down the doors
<br />
and find...Robotnik, St. John and Sally (in the container). 
<br />
Hamlin believes Geoffrey to be a traitor so he jumps him.  Sally
<br />
breaks it up and says she and St. John are on the same side.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnic reveals that Sally is an auto-automaton, a perfect
<br />
robot duplicate, and that there was no weakness in the defense
<br />
system.  His master plan is to replace key members of the freedom
<br />
fighters--we see auto-automatons of Sonic and Tails being built. 
<br />
Robotnik also plans to roboticize the Sally delivered to him by
<br />
St. John.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik begins the roboticization process but the chamber
<br />
blows up because a &quot;feedback loop&quot; has occurred.  Something which
<br />
is impossible unless...he were trying to roboticize a robot!  The
<br />
real Sally was with Dylan and Hamlin.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally tries to 'arrest' Robotnik, but large StealthBots
<br />
emerge from the walls and capture the freedom fighters.  Note:
<br />
you could see the outlines of the StealthBots 5 pages back.  St.
<br />
John pushes a button on a remote control and a vehicle burrows
<br />
its way up through the floor.  Out pop Penelope, Arlo and three
<br />
&quot;moles&quot;.  They help free Sally, Dylan and Hamlin (more paint
<br />
guns).  Robotnik manages to activate a 30-second self-destruct
<br />
and disappears down an escape chute.  Sally and the others all
<br />
head for the vehicle maintenance area and grab saucer-shaped air
<br />
cars (from Hanger 18!  X-P ) and get out with no time to spare. 
<br />
With everyone back at the base, Hamlin, Penelope, Arlo and Dylan
<br />
are promoted to full-fledged freedom fighters.  Sally tries to
<br />
convince Geoffrey to come to Knothole but he declines in order to
<br />
rejoin the Rebel Underground.  He does engage Sally in some
<br />
serious lip-locking before they part.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you're not confused yet, here's a run-down of the plot-
<br />
twists, as Sally explains them at the end:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The FIRST Sally switch occurred right at the beginning of
<br />
Part 1 shortly after meeting St. John.  St. John really was the
<br />
leader of the &quot;Rebel Underground&quot; and acted as a double agent in
<br />
order to gain Robotnik's trust and activate the robot double
<br />
prematurely in order to find out what its plans were.  It was the
<br />
auto-automaton Sally that helped attack the 2d and 3d
<br />
substations.  It was such a good copy that it could give orders,
<br />
make hard choices, and even grieve for missing comrades.  But did
<br />
you notice the two clues that would have tipped you off that this
<br />
was an automated Sally:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally wore a purple vest instead of a blue one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. &quot;Auto&quot; Sally referred to Geoffrey by his first name,
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;while the real Sally always called him &quot;Mr. St. John.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The SECOND Sally switch occurred in Part II, when Robotnik
<br />
(and the reader) was supposed to think that Sally was being
<br />
replaced by a robot double.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about Arlo and Penelope?  They were taken away by
<br />
the moles from the literal Rebel UNDERGROUND.  The Rebel
<br />
Underground was also supposed to be backup in case anything
<br />
unexpected happened.
<br />

<br />
&quot;This is definitely one of the most complicated stories Archie's
<br />
Sonic group has ever come up with.  Congrats....&quot;  JF

NOTES FROM THE NET: that's the heading suggested for comix-
<br />
related posts to a.f.s-h by none other than Paul Castiglia of
<br />
Archie Comics.  Seems P.C. thinks that NftN would make a good
<br />
subsection of the Sonic Grams, and said so in a recent post.  The
<br />
idea is that you can post to a.f.s-h, and your post (and e-mail
<br />
address if you want) will be reprinted in NftN.  But ONLY if you
<br />
specify that it's for NftN.  Apparently Archie Comics is still
<br />
getting a feel for whether they should go ahead with the plan, so
<br />
let's see some support for it!  Hmmm, wonder if Sally's e-mail
<br />
address is princess_at_frdmftrs.mobius.org ?

_Sonic the Hedgehog_ synopsis:
<br />
Note: Any resemblance between this book and the original comics
<br />
miniseries shouldn't be surprising; what IS surprising is how far
<br />
from the TV series this is.  Herewith, the &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot;
<br />
description:
<br />

<br />
Ch.1: At the beginning, Sonic is 7, Robotnik is 15, and both are
<br />
staying with Uncle Chuck (you get some idea of how non-canonical
<br />
this is going to get!).  While Robotnik is only interested in
<br />
gadgets, Sonic is only interested in running fast.  While Uncle
<br />
Chuck works on perfecting a power ring, Robotnik cannibalizes
<br />
parts from Uncle Chuck's old tractor for a robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck starts up the tractor, it goes out of control and heads for
<br />
Robotnik.  Ch. 2: Sonic interrupts a game of one-against-nine
<br />
baseball to move the tractor which has pinned Robotnik and Uncle
<br />
Chuck.  He's able to move it with the power ring and he takes
<br />
both Robotnik and Uncle Chuck to the hospital.  Ch. 3: After
<br />
being released from the hospital, Uncle Chuck and Robotnik return
<br />
home.  Robotnik's robot confesses to Uncle Chuck that he was put
<br />
together with the stolen tractor parts, and Robotnik is grounded.
<br />
Robotnik cobbles together another robot from Uncle Chuck's major
<br />
appliances; it grabs Uncle Chuck but Sonic defeats it by wrapping
<br />
it up in a garden hose.  Robotnik leaves.  Ch. 4: &quot;Eight years
<br />
passed.&quot;  Sonic, 15, has a pet dog, Muttski, and works as a
<br />
delivery hedgehog for his Uncle Chuck's chili dog stand.  Sonic
<br />
tests his new sneakers (designed by Uncle Chuck) while filling a
<br />
large order, but in his absence Robotnik returns and arrests
<br />
&quot;Uncle Chuck&quot; and his robots trash the stand.  Ch. 5: Sonic
<br />
delivers the chili dogs to an old factory, walking into a trap. 
<br />
He escapes and returns to what's left of the stand.  He destroys
<br />
a couple of robots who try to capture him and learns that
<br />
Robotnik is responsible.  He heads off for Robotnik's factory. 
<br />
Ch. 6: Stopping in the forest just outside the factory he
<br />
encounters &quot;a cute little chipmunk girl&quot;: Princess Sally Acorn. 
<br />
She shows Sonic a short-cut to the &quot;Ro-Bo-Machine.&quot;  Ch. 7:
<br />
Reaching the fence around the factory, Sonic sees that Uncle
<br />
Chuck has already been roboticized.  Sally tries to stop him, but
<br />
Sonic goes over the fence.  Ch. 8: Sonic goes into Sonic Spin and
<br />
takes out the SWATbots.  With Sally's help, they get Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski and head for the Great Forest.  Ch. 9: Sally leads
<br />
them to &quot;Knothole Village&quot; which is &quot;under the forest floor.&quot;
<br />
(cf. Sonic #0).  Sonic uses a power ring to restore Uncle Chuck
<br />
and Muttski.  None of the other Freedom Fighters are introduced.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
<br />
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
<br />
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
<br />
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
<br />
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized (see
<br />
above), which conflicts with &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; and, in fact, the
<br />
rest of the second season.
<br />

<br />

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Fortress of Fear_
<br />
PLOT SYNOPSIS: Ch. 1: Rotor is being held prisoner by Robotnik in
<br />
the old royal fortress, which is now Robotnik's headquarters.  He
<br />
shares a cell with a woodchuck named Digger, who says he's from a
<br />
Freedom Fighter group on the western edge of the Great Forest. 
<br />
Digger tells Rotor about the King's list of freedom fighters. 
<br />
Snively takes Digger away and tells Rotor that Robotnik's looking
<br />
for the list as well.  Ch. 2: Sonic &amp; Bunnie arrive at Robotnik's
<br />
fortress to bust Rotor out of his cell.  Guided by a small
<br />
transmitter in the lining of Rotor's cap, they locate the cell,
<br />
take out the bots and &quot;haul some serious haunch&quot; back to
<br />
Knothole.  Ch. 3: Snively reports the escape of Rotor to an
<br />
unconcerned Robotnik, who is preparing to rip the fortress apart
<br />
to locate the list.  Rotor tells the others about the list and
<br />
Robotnik's search for it.  Sally guesses that the list in
<br />
question was one of &quot;brave and true warriors&quot; compiled by Sally's
<br />
father when she was a girl.  A box of her father's papers turns
<br />
out to have a secret compartment which yields the following
<br />
fragment:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...beside your bed safe and...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...tucked in tight...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...you cannot fall...
<br />
Ch. 4: Sonic, Sally, Bunnie, Rotor and Antoine set out the
<br />
following evening.  Using a high-frequency generator, they
<br />
scramble the circuits of the SWATbots at the front gate.  Antoine
<br />
suggests beginning the search with the safe in her father's
<br />
bedroom.  Ch. 5: While Robotnik leads a search of the main level,
<br />
Snively detects the Freedom Fighters' entry into the fortress. 
<br />
Thinking to score points with Robotnik, Snively plans to capture
<br />
them himself.  The Freedom Fighters arrive at the bedroom, but
<br />
find Snively and a platoon of SWATbots.  Sonic and Bunnie take
<br />
out the bots while Antoine trips up Snively before he can grab
<br />
Sally.  Unfortunately, they notice that the safe door is open and
<br />
the safe is empty.  Ch. 6: Thinking of the second and third lines
<br />
of the fragment, Antoine suggests that it might be Sally's old
<br />
crib--a bed from which one cannot fall.  Sneaking to the nursery,
<br />
they discover that Robotnik hasn't gotten there yet.  Rotor tears
<br />
the mattress apart but finds nothing.  Snively arrives and locks
<br />
the Freedom Fighters in the nursery.  Ch. 7: While Snively goes
<br />
off to find Robotnik, Rotor accidentally bumps into an old music
<br />
box.  Sally suddenly realizes that the fragment of &quot;clues&quot; is
<br />
actually part of the lyrics of an old lullaby sung to the tune
<br />
the music box is playing.  The lyrics make mention of a clock,
<br />
which is no longer in the room.  Sally guesses that it was hidden
<br />
in one of the towers.  She also remembers a secret passageway
<br />
from the nursery to the tower.  Moving a book on a shelf, a panel
<br />
slides back, revealing a staircase.  Ch. 8: Ascending the
<br />
staircase, they find the clock in a room filled with old
<br />
furniture and such, but also find that the clock has been torn
<br />
apart.  Noticing that several pieces of SWATbot are lying about,
<br />
Sonic and Bunnie get inside the metal parts and act as if the
<br />
&quot;bot&quot; were escorting the others as prisoners.  Robotnik's
<br />
exultation at finding the list is interrupted when the bot and
<br />
its &quot;prisoners&quot; arrive.  Sonic grabs the list, lays out Robotnik,
<br />
and the Freedom Fighters escape.

PLOT SUMMARY:  [If you know the plot of the &quot;Game Guy&quot; episode
<br />
[second season], you pretty much know the plot of this book,
<br />
though there are several major differences.]  Ch. 1: Sally has a
<br />
nightmare wherein Robotnik displaces her father.  Referring to
<br />
the list that was captured in _Fortress of Fear_, and noting that
<br />
its descriptions of locations are extremely general, she plans to
<br />
begin searching in the Caverns in the Great Unknown.  Ch. 2:
<br />
Rotor tests a magnetic field generator, managing to snare Bunnie.
<br />

<br />
While exploring the caverns, they use the generator to dislodge a
<br />
boulder.  Spooked by a swarm of bats, Antoine becomes lost in the
<br />
cave.  Ch. 3: Antoine is found by the bank of an underground
<br />
river.  Using an inflatable raft, they head down the river and
<br />
are almost hurled over a waterfall.  They bed down for the night
<br />
but awaken in the morning to the sound of approaching SWATbots. 
<br />
Ch. 4: The SWATbots take no notice of the Knothole gang,
<br />
concentrating on an escaping figure.  Sonic helps out the
<br />
escapee, who turns out to be Ari on his way to free other freedom
<br />
fighters in his group being held by Robotnik.  Ch. 5: Ari
<br />
explains how his group, which originally numbered 20, has lived
<br />
on the run.  Sonic is all for helping him, but Sally doesn't
<br />
trust him.  When Sonic goes off alone with Ari, Rotor is able to
<br />
unscramble the bots' orders: to pretend to pursue Ari in order to
<br />
lure Sonic to a trap.  Ch. 6: Sonic and Ari reach the fortress,
<br />
but not before Sonic pulls Ari out of quicksand.  Once inside,
<br />
Ari lets Sonic get captured.  Ch. 7: Sally, Antoine, Rotor and
<br />
Bunnie are in pursuit of Sonic and Ari.  Sonic is deposited into
<br />
the large pinball game/arena, with the object of avoiding the
<br />
energy vortex.  Ari realizes that his comrades have been
<br />
roboticized and he's been double-crossed.  Ch. 8: The Knothole
<br />
gang arrive at the fortress and manage to save Ari.  He leads
<br />
them to Sonic.  In a major reversal of the TV plot, Ari manages
<br />
to pull Sonic out of the vortex, then helps him escape the game. 
<br />
As the group approaches Knothole, Ari returns home on his own.
