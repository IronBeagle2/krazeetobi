Ken:
<br />

<br />
This post pushed a couple of my favorite buttons:
<br />

<br />
[snip]
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; By this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; time, especially with the Saturday morning cartoon rating really high with
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the kids, it became clear that anything that featured SONIC and his pals was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; going to be scooped up by the kid crowd. If we had put out a KNUCKLES book
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; aimed at an older teen crowd, the parents of the pre-teen set would be out
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for blood, because here they would've bought a product they thought was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriate for their little ones. The people at Archie knew this and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; resisted efforts to push toward the older crowd. Mike and I were among those
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; that supported Archie in this. Sure, it meant we couldn't do some things we
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; would have liked to, but it did force us to get more creative in our approach
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the material.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />

<br />
I've got no problem with that.  What I think might be a concern with
<br />
some of us on the list is...well, I remember a statement that was made
<br />
in the context of a documentary on Elvis Presley's film career.  Someone
<br />
was quoted as saying: &quot;After 'Jailhouse Rock' they thought they could
<br />
put Elvis in ANYTHING and it would make money.  They were right.&quot;
<br />

<br />
THAT, I think, is the concern: not that you have a core audience and
<br />
you're sticking with it, but that the level of the writing might start
<br />
drifting downward to the lowest common denominator.  Glad to hear you're
<br />
working to stay creatively fresh.  Speaking of which:
<br />

<br />
[snip again]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If one chooses to, one can go back and reread the stories Mike and I have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; done on a number of levels. For example, &quot;IN THE STILL OF THE NIGHT&quot;, I had a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; number of mothers read this story to see if we handled the subject of death
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; appropriately enough. Not one objected. Not one.
</em><br />

<br />
I don't know when I first noticed Sonic comics for sale, but I can tell
<br />
you that the first issue I ever bought was #18, BECAUSE OF &quot;In The Still
<br />
Of The Night&quot;!  I was THAT impressed with your handling of the death of
<br />
Julayla.  It was excellent writing: nothing &quot;happened&quot; in the sense of
<br />
plot, but the story was very well written.  And I especially loved your
<br />
elegant solution to the problem posed in the old &quot;Kung Fu&quot; TV series!
<br />

<br />
Yet the best part of the story was the way it added depth to the
<br />
characters -- I've said as much in previous posts on this list, some
<br />
addressed to Paul Castiglia.  It made such an impression that I went so
<br />
far as to incorporate Julayla into one of my fanfic stories set in a
<br />
time when the freedom fighters were ten years old: &quot;Capture The Flag.&quot;
<br />
But enough about me.
<br />

<br />
There have been examples of strong writing throughout the series:
<br />
&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; saved the twist until the end, to good effect.
<br />
&quot;That's The Spirit&quot; worked well, though I thought Sally wouldn't be so
<br />
dismissive of Tails' insistance that Sonic was still alive--she seemed
<br />
more empathetic than that.  But then you have the two-parter &quot;Growing
<br />
Pains&quot; which started out with such promise, and which not a few of the
<br />
members of this list latched onto, only to turn into a train wreck in
<br />
the second half.  I don't know what you have planned for the next 18
<br />
months, but I know a lot of fans wouldn't be disappointed if you brought
<br />
back Fiona and had her joining the Knothole gang!
<br />

<br />
Just the usual $.02,
<br />
