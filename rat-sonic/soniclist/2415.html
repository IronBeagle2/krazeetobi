<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I HATE Antoine as a character.

<br />
I see Antoine as a foil for Sonic.  Sonic is cool; Antoine is the epitomy of
<br />
uncool. This works to great advantage in the SatAM show, but isn't as effective
<br />
in solo stories in the Archie comic series.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; (he's very annoying and doesn't provide that comic relief.  I think Rotor is a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; better comic relief, and he's usually not even funny!) 
</em><br />

<br />
Rotor is an unsung hero of the Freedom Fighters.  It's clear that what he does
<br />
is essential to their missions, but since he isn't always risking his hide like
<br />
Sonic, his role doesn't seem as exciting.  &quot;Tundra Road&quot; goes a long way towards
<br />
changing this though.  
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'm partial to Tails and Sally myself.  :)
</em><br />

<br />
Who isn't?  ;-)
<br />

<br />
A few comments on recent Sonic comic issues: 
<br />

<br />
[ SPOILERS ]
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
#31 - I too noticed the figure in the rocks on the cover, as Dmitry points out.
<br />
At first I thought it was a mountain spirit, but now it's beginning to make
<br />
sense in the context of the &quot;Lost...and Found!&quot; and succeeding Knuckles stories.
<br />

<br />
#32 - It seems odd that Mobie is more anthropoid than ursine, despite being
<br />
called a bear.  I also note that Uncle Chuck is drawn using an older hedgehog
<br />
design (from Scott Shaw!), while Sonic has become more streamlined.  Does this
<br />
mean that Sonic is wearing a different spine-style now?  :-)
<br />

<br />
#33 - I just _love_ the cover!  It just grows on you, it looks like it's been
<br />
drawn from life. :-)  I really appreciate the amount of detail Spaz puts into
<br />
his backgrounds.  As for the story &quot;Let's Get small!&quot;, I enjoyed it.  Despite
<br />
what some others may say, Manak's artwork appeals to me.  (Hmm, it would be
<br />
funny to see Alf in a Manak-drawn story, now that he's making a small comeback.)
<br />
While the setting isn't entirely original (&quot;Fantastic Voyage&quot;, and even &quot;Honey,
<br />
I Shrunk the Hedgehog&quot; from the weekday Sonic cartoon were set in micro-worlds),
<br />
and there wasn't much of a plot, the puns more than made up for it by the end.
<br />
:-)  The other freedom fighters were just cured too easily for me, but it was
<br />
fun to see Tails in drag.  I didn't think that &quot;Froggy Boy&quot; was an appropriate
<br />
insult for Sonic to be hurling (although quite in character for him); perhaps
<br />
something along the lines of &quot;Frog in ones throat&quot; would have been better.
<br />

<br />
I also noticed in the ad for SuperSonic vs. HyperKnuckles (2nd last page), 
<br />
that &quot;YIELDS&quot; is in neither Sonic's nor Knuckles' vocabulary.  I guess we
<br />
can rib Mike Gallagher about it. :-)
<br />

<br />
One comment about &quot;Sonic Shot&quot; -- Ken Penders' Tails looks a bit off.  Maybe
<br />
it's the neck, or the snout, but it just doesn't look like Tails to me.  Or
<br />
is this an older Tails we're beginning to see now?  :-)
<br />

<br />
SuperSonic vs. HyperKnuckles - as has been already mentioned on the list,
<br />
the pin-up poster was a couple of pages off-center.  Maybe the two Archie
<br />
ads were inserted after the page layout for &quot;Crash of the Titans&quot; had been
<br />
done?  Art Mawhinney is to be commended for his pencilling on this one.
<br />
I liked the cameo appearance of Orbinaut - Swatbots get oh so tiresome.
<br />
The &quot;legal department&quot; line was hilarious, too.  (At least to us on the 
<br />
Sonic list here, where it was coincidentally(?) a double entendre.)
<br />

<br />
&quot;Fathers and Sons&quot;, like most of the Knuckles stories I've read, has him 
<br />
musing quietly to himself all the way through.  This really builds mood.
<br />
Interesting to see that Knuckle's dad has dreads too.
<br />

<br />
Well, that's enough rambling for today...
<br />
