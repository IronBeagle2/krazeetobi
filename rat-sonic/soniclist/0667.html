&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Sonic the Hedgehog story
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Daniel J. Drazen
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chapter 8
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He wasn't sure how he had gotten there, but Sonic found
<br />
himself heading toward Robotropolis at full speed.  Above him,
<br />
the sky had grown darker than it had ever been, with the clouds
<br />
swirling around in no particular direction, like water boiling in
<br />
a pot.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamming past the buildings, he noticed out of the corner of
<br />
his eye that they seemed older than he'd remembered, and on the
<br />
verge of falling apart.  &quot;Ol' Buttnik's really letting the place
<br />
go to seed!  Well, after today it'll be all over.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic turned a corner and screeched to a halt.  There was
<br />
Robotnik, standing alone in the middle of the street.  Not a bot
<br />
anywhere in sight.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is it, Robuttnik!  It's game over for you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Robotnik didn't seem very concerned about Sonic.  Nor
<br />
did he seem to notice the wind whipping down the streets, or the
<br />
mad tempest in the sky.  And when he spoke, his voice was distant
<br />
and cold as a stone:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You don't understand, hedgehog.  You can't win.  Nobody
<br />
wins.  We all lose.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that instant, a change came over Robotnik.  Starting
<br />
with his feet, it was as if every molecule in his body suddenly
<br />
came unglued.  He began to disintegrate, fragmenting into
<br />
thousands of particles that were caught by the wind and
<br />
scattered.  The last to go was Robotnik's face, with a look of
<br />
hopelessness that Sonic had never seen before.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then Sonic had something new to think about.  For as he
<br />
looked about him, every building in Robotropolis began to fly
<br />
apart in a similar manner.  Even the ground beneath his sneakers
<br />
dissolved into a black, seemingly-endless nothing.  In a cold
<br />
panic, Sonic turned and raced back to Knothole, trying to put as
<br />
much distance as possible between himself and the approaching
<br />
nothingness behind him.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He reached Knothole, but he was too late.  The sky above him
<br />
was the same swirling madness.  In the wind and gloom he could
<br />
see Sally silently sinking into the ground beneath her.  He had
<br />
to do something.  He raced over to her, grabbed for her hand, and
<br />
felt it melt away in his own as if it were ice.  Then he watched
<br />
as the last of Sally, her eyes silently pleading for help,
<br />
slipped into dust.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the last trace of Mobius disappeared.  Sonic was
<br />
surrounded by a formless darkness.  He felt himself falling--not
<br />
falling down or in any particular direction, just falling.  And
<br />
he knew he would fall forever and ever.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;NO!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a start, Sonic awoke from his dream.  He was shaken,
<br />
sweating and exhausted.  This wasn't your usual one-chilidog-too-
<br />
many nightmare!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he heard it, the sound coming from a nearby hut, one
<br />
with lights inside.  A voice...Sally's voice...trying to scream
<br />
out the word &quot;No&quot; over and over, repeatedly hindered by her own
<br />
sobs.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic saw his Uncle Chuck standing at the window, looking
<br />
out.  He got out of bed and walked over to him.  Sonic bowed his
<br />
head and felt his eyes filling with tears, as he also felt Uncle
<br />
Chuck's hand resting on his shoulder.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's over, Sonie,&quot; was all he could say.  &quot;It's over.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a better and more peaceful time, the death of the Queen
<br />
of Mobius would have been a solemn state occasion.  The sparkling
<br />
white buildings of the city would have been dotted with black
<br />
banners.  A large canopy would have been erected in the palace
<br />
gardens.  Beneath it would have rested the handcarved wooden
<br />
casket of the Queen, covered by an elegant white pall embroidered
<br />
with the name of the deceased and the symbol of her family's
<br />
house--in the case of Queen Alicia, the House of Twin Trees. 
<br />
There it would remain for a day and a night as mourners from
<br />
every corner of Mobius and from every walk of life would file by
<br />
to pay their last respects.  Then the casket would be carried by
<br />
mourning family members into the Great Hall of the palace. 
<br />
There, a massed choir would sing the &quot;Return,&quot; the traditional
<br />
Mobian requiem, in the seven-part harmony reserved for the
<br />
occasion.  Finally, the pall would slowly be raised to the
<br />
ceiling of the Great Hall, where it would hang as a banner from
<br />
that day forward, while the body of the Queen would have been
<br />
laid to rest in the royal burial chamber beneath the palace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there was no more palace, no more city, no world as it
<br />
once had been.  Still, the Queen was dead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As dawn broke over Knothole, it was clear that nobody was
<br />
asleep.  Everyone knew what had happened during the night and
<br />
they were now outdoors in the cold of the early sunshine,
<br />
waiting.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inside Sally's hut, she and her sister had spent the evening
<br />
preparing their mother's body for burial.  Mobian custom dictated
<br />
that only the family perform this rite, so as to put no barrier
<br />
between them and their grief.  Even if it meant breaking down in
<br />
tears every few minutes, tradition compelled them to perform the
<br />
task.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the body had been washed, it was wrapped tight in the
<br />
bedsheet.  Sally held her mother's cold face in her hands and
<br />
kissed it one last time before it was covered.  Shorter strips of
<br />
linen were used to tie the sheet together at the ankles, knees,
<br />
waist, below the shoulders, and across the forehead.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally and Sandy each had in their possession a bakhat, a
<br />
long black band of cloth wound many times about the waist in such
<br />
a way that the ends could be tossed over either shoulder.  For
<br />
ten days after the burial of a family member, mourners were to
<br />
wear the bakhat at all times.  With this article tied in place,
<br />
the two sisters took hold of the body and placed it on the litter
<br />
that had been used to bring the Queen into the hut.  Someone had
<br />
left a quilted comforter on the porch, and this was draped over
<br />
the body; this was the most fitting pall they could find.  Then
<br />
the two sister began to bear the body to its final resting place.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside, they passed the Knothole freedom fighters, gathered
<br />
silently in two rows to watch the body pass by.  As the
<br />
sisters walked past, the mourners formed a line behind the body,
<br />
moving in solemn procession.  Rotor stood with cap in hand and
<br />
with his head bowed.  Sonic saw Tails standing next to him and
<br />
looking up at the hedgehog with pleading eyes.  Sonic guessed at
<br />
Tails' unasked question and gently said: &quot;Hey, it's cool to cry.&quot; 
<br />
And as Tails did so, Sonic did something he hadn't done since
<br />
Tails was a cub: he picked up the heartbroken fox and cradled him
<br />
in his arms.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As Sally and Sandy neared the grave site, there was a
<br />
rustling of the bushes nearby.  They parted, and into the
<br />
clearing stepped Lupe' and the other members of the Wolf Pack
<br />
freedom fighters.  As they did so, they each dropped to one knee
<br />
as the body passed by.  Bunnie smiled, glad that her message to
<br />
Lupe' had reached her in time and that the Wolf Pack had been
<br />
able to come.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the grave, the ceremony continued in silence.  Sally and
<br />
Sandy each unwould the bakhat from around their waist and slid it
<br />
under the body.  With these they lowered the body of Queen Alicia
<br />
into the ground, thus recalling the ritual item's origin.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was nothing more for Sally and Sandy to do.  Custom
<br />
dictated that theirs was not the task of filling in the grave. 
<br />
That was left to the others who, one handful of dirt at a time,
<br />
solemnly buried their Queen.  As they did, many of them came over
<br />
to Sally and embraced her.  The Wolf Pack let out a mourning
<br />
howl.  And Antoine, wearing his finest dress uniform, stood
<br />
saluting at the graveside, his body at rigid attention except
<br />
that his shoulders heaved with sobs and his face was contorted
<br />
with grief.  He was torn between duty and emotion, and Sonic
<br />
later said it made him look ridiculous.  &quot;Ah know,&quot; Bunnie said,
<br />
&quot;and that's what made it so sweet.&quot;  Few noticed it at the time,
<br />
but there was a calmness about Sandy, a serenity that was not at
<br />
all reassuring.
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was taking a big chance, but she quietly rapped on
<br />
the door of Sally's hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing had been seen of Sally or Sandy since the burial
<br />
earlier that morning, for custom dictated that the family go into
<br />
seclusion for a day and a night.  Still, Bunnie felt she had to
<br />
talk to someone, and could think of no one better than her best
<br />
friend.  When there was no answer, she slowly opened the door.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally lay in her bed, still wearing her vest and boots in
<br />
addition to the black bakhat.  That Sally would have gone to bed
<br />
with her clothes on was unusual enough.  She was half-curled in a
<br />
fetal position, and her face was still streaked from tears
<br />
recently shed.  She breathed in the steady rhythms of sleep. 
<br />
Nicole sat on the nightstand next to her, open and with one light
<br />
blinking.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no point in waking her up, Bunnie thought.  The
<br />
physical and emotional exhaustion of the last few days had
<br />
finally caught up with her.  Bunnie gingerly started to pick up
<br />
Nicole to shut the case.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Shhh!&quot; Bunnie whispered.  Nicole repeated the question at
<br />
half-volume.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What was she doin'?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SALLY HAD REQUESTED A PLAYBACK OF ORAL HISTORY FROM THE
<br />
ROYAL ARCHIVES: QUEEN ALICIA'S DESCRIPTION OF HER CHILDHOOD IN
<br />
THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES.  DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's OK, Nicole.  Just...uh...just mark the spot and
<br />
she'll get back to it.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie shut the lid and was about to set Nicole down on the
<br />
table when she noticed a piece of paper stuck to the back of the
<br />
door.  It was written in an alphabet that was foreign to her.  It
<br />
was then that it occured to her to look around the hut again.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sandy was nowhere to be seen.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the paper down from where it had been tacked up, she
<br />
quietly left the hut and the still-sleeping Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie wondered what to do with the letter.  She couldn't
<br />
show it to Uncle Chuck because Dulcy had taken him back to
<br />
Robotropolis a short time ago.  He said he'd wanted to get back
<br />
and search Robotnik's computers to see if there was any more
<br />
information they could yield on deroboticizing technology.  Sonic
<br />
hadn't wanted to see his uncle go back to living in Robotnik's
<br />
shadow, but Uncle Chuck was firm: &quot;Sonic, we're not just fighting
<br />
against Robotnik anymore: we're fighting against time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shadow passed over Bunnie and she looked up.  It was
<br />
Dulcy, getting ready to land.  That meant anything could happen.
<br />
Then Bunnie noticed that Sonic was seated on a nearby tree stump,
<br />
his chin resting on his hands.  He appeared to be in Dulcy's
<br />
landing path, but was too depressed to notice. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Bunnie could say anything, Dulcy hit the ground and
<br />
skidded to a halt just inches away from Sonic's sneakers.  The
<br />
hedgehog didn't move.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Dulc,&quot; he said listlessly.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sonic.  I got Uncle Chuck back OK.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah, swell.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, Sonic,&quot; Bunnie called out now that it was safe to walk
<br />
toward him, &quot;you seen Sandy anywhere?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Isn't she with Sal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nuh-uh.  Sal's all by herself.  But Ah DID find this,&quot; she
<br />
said as she produced the handwritten note.  Sonic studied it for
<br />
a second.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I give; what's it say?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;How the hoo-ha should Ah know?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Hey, maybe Nicole can read this.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh mah stars, Ah completely forgot!  Ah've still got her.&quot; 
<br />
She gave the handheld computer to Sonic, with whom Nicole was
<br />
on &quot;speaking terms.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Nicole!  Front and center!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SONIC...WHAT UP?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Can you read this?&quot;  He held the note up close to Nicole.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SCANNING NOW.&quot;  A second later, a torrent of consonants was
<br />
coming out of Nicole's speaker.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yikes!  Nicole, you flip a chip or what!?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;SORRY...MY MAIN HEDGEHOG...YOU SAID TO READ THE LETTER, AND
<br />
IT'S WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE NOMADS.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, then just give me a translation; something *I* can
<br />
relate to.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;YOU GOT IT.&quot;  There was a pause of several seconds.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;'YO, SAL.  IT'S PAYBACK TIME.  I'M TAKING ROBOTNIK DOWN,
<br />
AND SINCE I'VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO LOSE, I'M GOING DOWN WITH
<br />
HIM.  I'M OUT OF HERE...FOREVER.'&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be continued
