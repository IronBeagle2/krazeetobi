<br />
Just to settle the argument, Sally and Sonic were 13 at the commencement, and
<br />
they're currently 15 right now. The story with Julayla was written just
<br />
before &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; aired, as we were working from a script because we
<br />
needed to establish the character of Rosie. As I recall, the time-line wasn't
<br />
too established in the script we were working from, as the war was only going
<br />
on for a couple of years. 
<br />

<br />
We worked out our own timeline as a result, based on SEGA treating the
<br />
characters as if they aged at the same rate we do. If we treated them in
<br />
terms of how animals really age (so many of their years = one of ours), Sonic
<br />
and Sally would've been portrayed as battle-hardened adults by this time. As
<br />
further proof of this, when we portrayed Sonic and Sally married in the
<br />
future, there were a few comments about how old they should be to get
<br />
married.
<br />

<br />
To go by the timeline that the war started when Sonic and Sally were five
<br />
didn't make sense, especially when you factor in their current age. As far as
<br />
we were concerned, this was one time when the show got it wrong. However,
<br />
because it's TV, most people accept that version as gospel. My attitude is
<br />
that it's the games that establish the world of Sonic, with the series,
<br />
paperbacks and comics filling in the details, with neither one more valid
<br />
than the other. Mike and I tried to be consistent with all versions, but for
<br />
various reasons, couldn't always be.
<br />

<br />
Mike and I constantly disagree over what happens in the world of Sonic, as we
<br />
try our best to do the best stories we can. And our approach definitely
<br />
differs from the other writers involved in the series. That doesn't mean
<br />
they're wrong or bad. They just have a different slant on the characters and
<br />
series.
<br />

<br />
So go ahead, enjoy your take on the world of SONIC. Think of Sonic like some
<br />
of the other classic characters, and how many different versions of Batman
<br />
and Superman there are. I guess you could chalk it all up to artistic
<br />
interpretation.
<br />

<br />
However, if you ask a question to settle a debate, you're going to get my
<br />
interpretation that I work out with the editors at Archie and the licensing
<br />
department at SEGA, okay?
<br />
