(Continued from 1/2)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It had been about one hour and 45 minutes after Robotnik and
<br />
Packbell arrived at the probe's crash site at 0800 hours, and
<br />
Robotnik had still been no closer to understanding what the
<br />
hieroglyphics meant than what he knew a few hours before. 
<br />
Pacing around the dead probe, he kept his eyes on the WorkerBots
<br />
and the weapon, with more emphasis on the weapon.  The
<br />
hieroglyphics made no sense whatsoever, and it was becoming more
<br />
than obvious that the translation program wasn't about to
<br />
retrieve the linguistics base anytime soon, if ever.  It was
<br />
clear that the device was SOME kind of weapon, but WHAT?  He
<br />
considered the point over and over in his mind, knowing that the
<br />
time that he spent thinking about the weapon's use gave Sonic
<br />
and his companions time to learn that something was amuck, and
<br />
they would come to investigate and/or prevent the process from
<br />
obtaining completion.  He was about to slip into that mood he
<br />
felt earlier in the day, when he learned that the lab had been
<br />
destroyed.  Today was about to be another one of those days...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently Packbell had noticed the general futility of the
<br />
situation, for he voiced it for both of them.  &quot;Dr. Robotnik, it
<br />
is entirely possible that Sonic may become wise to the
<br />
situation.  We must leave soon before he arrives.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik cringed in disbelief when he heard that, but he knew
<br />
that Packbell was right.  Further waiting on his part would only
<br />
serve to jeopardize the mission.  The only option left was to
<br />
scrap both the mission and the probe's cargo.  Unless...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik considered the unfinished thought further.  'No,
<br />
pouring over the language program by ourselves won't be enough,'
<br />
he thought.  'However, maybe we can get the Freedom Fighters to
<br />
do it for us, and then WE take the weapon!  Yes, that's good,
<br />
very good indeed.'
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He then made a turn to Packbell.  &quot;Packbell, notify the
<br />
WorkerBots and SWATBots to cancel the retrieval project.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell could only stand in his position in front of Robotnik,
<br />
mouth agape with surprise and possibly mild shock.  &quot;Doctor,&quot; he
<br />
said, &quot;are you certain about this?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik's anger nearly flared, surprised at Packbell's
<br />
ignorance to the opportunity that leaving the probe would give
<br />
them.  &quot;Yes, Packbell my boy.  Leave the probe.  This would give
<br />
us the opportunity for the Freedom Fighters to do the work for
<br />
us.&quot;  He managed to keep his anger under control, at least on
<br />
the outside.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell's shocked glare converted to one of elated
<br />
understanding as the hexadecimal codes in his positronic matrix
<br />
resolved the procedure of this new tactic.  His only response
<br />
was to radio the message to the other robots present.  The
<br />
robots suddenly stopped working and began converging on their
<br />
transport units.  Robotnik and Packbell followed suit.  A few
<br />
minutes later, there was no sign of Robotnik or anything else
<br />
native to Mobius in the probe's area.  Except for a few stealthy
<br />
devices that Robotnik left behind to provide a visual link to
<br />
Robotnik's personal Hover Unit.  This precaution was for the
<br />
arrival of a certain blue hedgehog that Robotnik knew and
<br />
loved...to roboticise.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The midday sun blazed in all its fury down on Dulcy, and she
<br />
didn't know how much more heat she could withstand.  &quot;How much
<br />
further, Sally?&quot; she questioned, unable to hide the evidence of
<br />
heat exhaustion from her voice.  &quot;I gotta stop for a water break
<br />
soon.  It's hot out here!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally weren't much better off than Dulcy.  Sonic was
<br />
sweating so much that he felt like the raging one km-high
<br />
waterfall in Bolder Bay.  Sally was feeling a little lightheaded
<br />
from the extended thermal exposure.  One point was clear to all
<br />
three:  find a shaded area and drink copious amounts of water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally scanned over the barren landscape for a suitable area
<br />
with her IR/binocular unit, then pointed the location out to
<br />
Dulcy.  It was a cliff outcrop located in a valley that had
<br />
enough shade for the three of them, plus some space to stretch
<br />
out and relax for a while.  &quot;Right down there looks fine,
<br />
Dulcy,&quot; said Sally in a tone similar to Dulcy's.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Music to my ears!  Going down!&quot; Dulcy said, ecstatic about the
<br />
prospect of being able to get out of the sun's heat for a while.
<br />
&nbsp;With strength that she didn't even know she still had, she
<br />
snapped her tail to accelerate down to the new-found haven. 
<br />
Acceleration which Sonic and Sally weren't exactly prepared for,
<br />
or even able to tolerate.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yo, Dulce!  Not so fast!  I'm gonna hurl if this keeps up!&quot;
<br />
Sonic exclaimed, his face becoming a blue-gray tint in response
<br />
to the sudden downward thrust.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was too late for any deceleration to take place.  Dulcy was
<br />
already well into her dive-bomb orientation, about 30 degrees
<br />
relative to the ground.  Two seconds later, she angled her upper
<br />
body high to facilitate landing, but she did so slightly too
<br />
fast.  With her aerodynamics sufficiently disrupted, she and her
<br />
friends hung in midair about two meters above the ground.  For a
<br />
painfully long time (it was actually about a second), Dulcy
<br />
looked over to her companions as if to give an apologetic
<br />
&quot;Oops&quot;, and then dropped like a massive bomb to the hard rock
<br />
below them.  Short screams came from the comrades as the air
<br />
forcefully discharged them from its stronghold.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ooohh, I'm home, Ma,&quot; Dulcy babbled in mild shock.  After
<br />
shaking the disorienting feeling out of her head,  Dulcy took
<br />
stock of her situation.  Her posterior was the ultimate tribute
<br />
to discomfort, but the pain would pass.  She also felt two furry
<br />
bodies gripping her back with unprecedented strength.   Dulcy
<br />
looked over her shoulder to Sonic and Sally.  &quot;Are you two OK?&quot;
<br />
she inquired, concerned about their facial expressions.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked as if he was ready to expel his breakfast with
<br />
extreme prejudice, and Sally wasn't too far behind in completing
<br />
a similar act herself.  After having a detailed view of Dulcy's
<br />
worried face, they managed to expedite a small degree of control
<br />
over their digestive systems.  &quot;Not if you count my stomach,&quot;
<br />
the two said in unison, with a hint of the resonance forced by
<br />
the impact still in their voices.  Temporarily not in their best
<br />
condition, but otherwise functional.  They slid slowly down
<br />
Dulcy's back, in order to prevent a relapse of that unpleasant
<br />
feeling in their abdominal area.  Dulcy then assisted them in
<br />
the short travel to the shade.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After an hour of lounging in the shaded refuge and having
<br />
liberal amounts of water applied both internally and externally,
<br />
the three were prepared to continue the mission.  Now all that
<br />
remained to be accomplished was to arrive at the intended
<br />
destination and prevent Robotnik from taking action on whatever
<br />
plan he had for the innovative wartoy.  The only problem was: 
<br />
where was the probe relative to their location?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole,&quot; Sally commanded, &quot;show our location relative to the
<br />
location of the alien probe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Unable to comply, Sally,&quot; Nicole responded politely, almost
<br />
apologetically.  &quot;The present location is an area that has
<br />
unusually high concentration of refractory minerals which are
<br />
preventing any fix of a reliable bearing.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not having the required background in basic geology, Sonic gave
<br />
a disdainful look to Sally and Nicole, with emphasis on Nicole. 
<br />
He said nothing, for his face revealed all.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole didn't understand the expression on the hedgehog's face,
<br />
but Sally did.  &quot;She means, Sonic,&quot; Sally explained, &quot;that there
<br />
are rocks in this valley that are affecting her sensors.  We
<br />
need to get out of this valley to find the probe's location
<br />
again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't know about that, Sal,&quot; Sonic said thoughtfully. 
<br />
&quot;Besides, take a look at that.&quot;  To emphasize his point, he
<br />
pointed toward the sky.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Little did they realize during their reprieve from the heat,
<br />
the sky had been turning darker and darker during the time that
<br />
they spent hiding from the sun.  Darkness meant heavy cloud
<br />
cover.  Heavy cloud cover meant rain.  And rain in the desert
<br />
meant floods, for the rain came down in a torrential downpour. 
<br />
With further consideration, they realized that they were in the
<br />
worst possible area to get away from the sun and a flood.  There
<br />
was a roar in the distance from the south end of the valley.  A
<br />
roar that signified the relentless advance of a solid wall of
<br />
water.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no time for words;  only actions would serve their
<br />
purpose here.  Sonic and Sally took their positions on Dulcy's
<br />
back, and gripped her scales with all the strength they had. 
<br />
Dulcy leaped into the air, and shot off like a torpedo with all
<br />
the might she could manage to give.  Two seconds later, the wall
<br />
of water screamed by them, inundating their resting place that
<br />
would have become their permanent residence had they not acted
<br />
hastily.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, so much for getting out of there,&quot; Dulcy observed.  &quot;Can
<br />
you get a fix on the probe now, Sally?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sorry, Dulcy,&quot; Sally replied.  &quot;Too much interference from the
<br />
storm.  I can't even tell what direction we're going.&quot;  Nicole's
<br />
sensors had been enhanced, but Bookshire and Sally didn't
<br />
account for a scenario of this nature where enhanced (but
<br />
unshielded) sensors would be at best, only disoriented.  The
<br />
worst case wasn't very appealing, and would require the long and
<br />
tedious construction of a new computer unit.  This was time that
<br />
they didn't have the luxury to spend.  Unless...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally tried to remember everything that Bookshire had installed
<br />
in Nicole.  EVERYTHING.  Then, something in her mind finally
<br />
connected.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Nicole,&quot; she said, &quot;decrease the search radius and buffer the
<br />
sensor inputs.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, what's that going to do?&quot; Sonic said with familiar
<br />
confusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This should help Nicole get a better chance find the probe
<br />
again,&quot; Sally replied.  &quot;Besides, we can't be too far away from
<br />
the probe that we can't just use a short range sensor scan.  It
<br />
would take a load off the long-range scanners and be much more
<br />
effective.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently content with the parsed data, Sonic said nothing
<br />
further.  The only sounds now were the sounds of the storm,
<br />
Dulcy's wings, and Nicole making a scan with the reconfigured
<br />
sensors.  A few moments later, an acknowledgment sound came from
<br />
Nicole.  The three friends waited in anticipation for the
<br />
bearing.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally read the data display, and translated it for Dulcy. 
<br />
&quot;Dulcy,&quot; she said, &quot;turn right and keep going straight.  That
<br />
way is to the probe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right, Sally,&quot; said the dragon.  &quot;Oh, and by the way,&quot;
<br />
Dulcy said jokingly, &quot;does anyone want to stay here?  Nice
<br />
river-front property available;  wouldn't want to see it go to
<br />
waste.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Helpless guffaws from all three ensued.  Their spirits lifted
<br />
again, they flew off to attend to some more serious matters.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to a stop at an area five km away from the probe's
<br />
crash site, dry and none the worse for wear...so far.  Due to
<br />
the prearranged mission plans, Dulcy would stay behind and
<br />
monitor from a remote location.  Robotnik has been out looking
<br />
for dragons again recently, and now wasn't exactly a good time
<br />
for a dragon to be visible to his sensors.  He had ways of
<br />
capturing dragons that weren't exactly pleasant, plus there was
<br />
a chance that Robotnik had that technology with him.  In this
<br />
case, stealth was the best defense.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Remember, Dulce,&quot; Sonic admonished, &quot;you stay here an keep an
<br />
eye out for Chrome Dome and his pals.  If we get into trouble,
<br />
jam back to Knothole, pronto.  Sal and I will take care of
<br />
things at our end.&quot;  A pause, and then he continued.  &quot;Any
<br />
questions?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon could only shake her head in the gesture of &quot;no&quot;. 
<br />
Dulcy was far too knowledgeable about Freedom Fighter tactics,
<br />
and the confrontation with Robotnik was always met with the same
<br />
basis of one of the tactical codes:  risk as few people as
<br />
possible, while still allowing for successful completion of the
<br />
mission.  However, that didn't mean that she was required to
<br />
like the orders she had been given.  Dulcy had a concerned look
<br />
on her face to that effect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic sensed this sign of dissension, and decided to be
<br />
diplomatic about it.  &quot;Look, Dulcy,&quot; the hedgehog said kindly,
<br />
&quot;I know you want to help us kick old Buttnik's tail.  But this
<br />
is for your protection as well as ours.&quot;  He thought for a few
<br />
seconds, tapping his foot, and produced an innovative plan to
<br />
appeal to Dulcy.  His eyes lit up with the glee.  &quot;Tell ya
<br />
what,&quot; he continued, &quot;sometime soon I'm probably going after one
<br />
of Robotnik's wartoys in Robotown.  I want you on my lookout
<br />
team, only this time, you'll be able to do more.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulcy looked at Sonic in shocked disbelief, but said nothing. 
<br />
Sonic nodded with an honest smile on his face to confirm her
<br />
suspicions that she hadn't misread his proposal.  She thought it
<br />
over, and decided that it was a fair trade.  &quot;Good luck you
<br />
two,&quot; she finally said.  &quot;I'll be watching to see that you two
<br />
kids don't cause any trouble.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few seconds of laughter later, and everyone's nerves had been
<br />
settled.  Dulcy usually was one to look at the brighter side of
<br />
just about everything, and had more than once made that point
<br />
apparent, however humorous it was.  Then again, it could have
<br />
been because of the humor that people might see in it.  Whatever
<br />
the reason, Dulcy got the message, and made it clear in her own
<br />
way that she would stolidly stand by her promise.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied that his message had completed its intended service,
<br />
Sonic said to Sally, &quot;Come on, Sal!  My sneaks are just itching
<br />
to hit the old road!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Ready Sonic,&quot; was the reply from Sally, analyzing Nicole's
<br />
diagnostics.  &quot;Just had check Nicole's sensors.  They're fine.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cool.  So let's get outta here.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic picked up Sally, and held her horizontally across his
<br />
arms.  His feet accelerated in place, and his legs soon became a
<br />
circular blur of motion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Warp time!&quot; Sonic exclaimed as his velocity rose to critical.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a sonic boom, and a blue blur where Sonic and Sally
<br />
had been.  A few seconds later, they were nearly halfway to the
<br />
crashed probe and the mystery weapon it carried.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On their way to the probe, Sonic thought he saw something very
<br />
familiar.  He decelerated to a stop to get a more detailed look
<br />
at what this object was.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What's wrong, Sonic?&quot; Sally inquired, concerned.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I don't get it, Sal,&quot; Sonic replied, baffled.  &quot;I think I just
<br />
saw US around here somewhere.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;What are you talking about, Sonic?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic had no answer to that question.  He quickly scanned over
<br />
the immediate vicinity with his eyes, and found the familiar
<br />
objects again.  His suspicions were confirmed.  &quot;Over there,
<br />
Sal!  Look!&quot; Sonic blurted, pointing out the location behind the
<br />
exposed old granite intrusion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally looked toward the specified area.  She was just as
<br />
shocked by what she saw as Sonic.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was another Sonic and Sally present.  The two pairs of
<br />
Knothole Freedom Fighters stared at each other for an
<br />
indeterminate amount of time, due to the shock of seeing
<br />
themselves.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;other&quot; Sonic was the one to break the spell.  &quot;Sal, we've
<br />
seen ourselves!  We came back too late!&quot; he yelled, the pinnacle
<br />
of failure present in his voice.  He picked up the &quot;other&quot; Sally
<br />
and sped off to an area unknown.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic and Sally looked at each other, mouths completely open
<br />
with shock again after seeing this totally unexpected spectacle
<br />
take place.  Neither knew what to say, until Sonic asked the
<br />
obvious question about the authenticity of the &quot;other&quot; Sonic and
<br />
Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was nearly at a loss for words.  &quot;Sal,&quot; he muttered, as
<br />
if he didn't trust his mouth to emit coherent speech, &quot;was THAT
<br />
us?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It looked like us, but I'm not sure if it was or not,&quot; was all
<br />
that Sally could contribute to their minuscule library of
<br />
knowledge on the subject.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic considered the matter over again in his mind, thought
<br />
about the possibilities, and decided not to progress any further
<br />
on the matter.  They had more important ways to occupy their
<br />
time, such as finding out what the hieroglyphs in the probe
<br />
meant.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He made the point clear to Sally.  &quot;Well, whether it was or
<br />
not,&quot; he said with a hint of responsibility in his voice, &quot;we
<br />
have more important things to worry about:  Robuttnik and that
<br />
probe.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally was still somewhat disoriented, but understood Sonic well
<br />
enough to voice her opinion as well.  &quot;I agree.  Let's go!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic's legs became a circular blur of motion again, and his
<br />
former location exploded in a thunderclap-like sound.  In about
<br />
two seconds, he and Sally were at the crash site.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After their arrival, Sonic performed a quick countersurveilance
<br />
procedure, to insure that Robotnik wouldn't be watching them
<br />
from a remote location.  Finding no evidence of any equipment,
<br />
Sonic gave Sally the &quot;go ahead&quot; gesture.  Sally walked over to a
<br />
computer terminal and began work on the hieroglyphics with
<br />
Nicole.  Little did they know that Robotnik was watching them,
<br />
and in a way they hadn't anticipated.  The new
<br />
StealthSurveilance Orbs were performing admirably.  Now all
<br />
Robotnik had to do was watch the audio/video downlink, and take
<br />
action at the proper time.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One hour later, Sonic was becoming restless.  Belated thoughts
<br />
of danger and warnings passed through his mind.  This was the
<br />
time that the &quot;what ifs&quot; started a mental reign of terror.  What
<br />
if Sonic had missed something in his antisurveillance pass? 
<br />
What if Robotnik really was watching them?  What if...the
<br />
thought was too unsettling to finish in the privacy of his own
<br />
mind.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, Sal,&quot; Sonic began, nervously, &quot;are we going to get the
<br />
results anytime this century?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I'm no closer to finishing than the last time you asked - five
<br />
seconds ago,&quot; Sally retorted.  &quot;I don't even know if this
<br />
translation program will work, so I'm trying to give Nicole as
<br />
much data as possible to increase the language base she has to
<br />
work with.  Besides that, I've had to get Nicole to supply
<br />
partial power to the computers here just to get them to work. 
<br />
It hasn't been easy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still somewhat nervous, and yet unwilling to interrupt Sally
<br />
any further, Sonic walked over what remained of the &quot;top&quot; of the
<br />
probe.  He quickly looked over the landscape with his
<br />
binoculars.  He looked out about five km, and saw no sign of
<br />
anything, organic or otherwise, besides Dulcy.  He directed his
<br />
IR/binocular unit visual sensor toward Dulcy.  She waved to him
<br />
to signal that they were still in her sights;  Sonic waved back
<br />
to acknowledge the signal.  Having nothing else to occupy his
<br />
time besides keeping watch, Sonic didn't know how much more
<br />
suspense he could take.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fortunately for Sonic, he wouldn't have to wait any longer. 
<br />
Sally had just finished scanning over the last bits of data they
<br />
could find for the translation program to use.  Nicole said the
<br />
key phrases that both of them had been waiting for: 
<br />
&quot;Transcription complete.  Data currently saved to permanent
<br />
storage.  Executing language compiler.&quot;  The wait after then was
<br />
minute compared to the transcription phase, but it still
<br />
irritated Sonic's nerves.  &quot;Translation complete.  Data prepared
<br />
for display purposes.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Display data,&quot; Sally commanded, relieved that the process was
<br />
over.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preliminary data that the probe had concerning the point of
<br />
origin and other location points were visible via the
<br />
holographic projection.  As Sally scrolled the data page down,
<br />
relief immediately converted to horror.  Noticing this sudden
<br />
change on Sally's face, Sonic jumped down from his guard
<br />
position to investigate the affair in detail.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked over to his close friend of eleven years, and
<br />
queried Sally on the sudden change of situation.  &quot;What's up,
<br />
Sal?&quot; he asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally said nothing.  She looked as if she couldn't even trust
<br />
herself to speak.  When this only continued to provoke a
<br />
concerned response from Sonic, she handed Nicole to Sonic for
<br />
his personal investigation.  Most of the text and other video
<br />
was nothing more than useless technobabble to him, but he
<br />
understood enough to see why Sally had become so afraid of being
<br />
around the probe and its cargo.  A similar look spread over his
<br />
face, and he even began to feel a bit sick at the prospect.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You're telling me, Nicole,&quot; Sonic questioned, seeking
<br />
verification, &quot;that this is a TIME MACHINE?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the crudest sense, the device is a time machine.  According
<br />
to the available data, the weapon was used to-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was hastily interrupted by Sonic.  &quot;Yes, yes, I got the
<br />
picture, Nicole,&quot; was the hedgehog's only response to the
<br />
halting the continuation of the more graphic contributions the
<br />
general utilization file had.  Toying with the space/time
<br />
continuum was something that gave him a headache, in more ways
<br />
than one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cassandrans had been wise to rid themselves of this weapon;
<br />
&nbsp;only the probe was supposed to be destroyed in their star
<br />
system, not to crash-land on an alien planet where it was
<br />
possible for someone like Robotnik to get his hands on.  The
<br />
survival of the probe had destroyed their planet, so the probe
<br />
was the final connection to the Cassandrans' existence.  A
<br />
legacy that had to be destroyed before anything detrimental
<br />
could happen to other planets.  It was far too late for
<br />
Cassandra, but not so for Mobius, if Sonic and Sally acted fast.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finding her courage again, Sally managed to speak.  &quot;Sonic,
<br />
this thing needs to be destroyed.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Gotcha, Sal.  So how?&quot; the hedgehog ventured.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, first we need to get that protective cover off.&quot;  To
<br />
Nicole, she said, &quot;Nicole, access data regarding the unloading
<br />
procedure.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Searching for required index,&quot; Nicole dictated.  After a
<br />
second of scanning over the permanent data storage unit, Nicole
<br />
found the requested file.  &quot;Reading file, Sally.&quot;  A holographic
<br />
display appeared about two meters in front of Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right, Sonic,&quot; Sally said, &quot;let's get to work.  First
<br />
locate the code latches along the base.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They dove into the procedure, as per instructions translated by
<br />
Nicole.  They were that much closer to destroying the weapon.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the unloading process was going on at the probe's
<br />
location, Robotnik made the decision to move in.  He made a call
<br />
to his field commander, with a smile of accomplishment on his
<br />
face.  &quot;Packbell!  Notify the other Hover Units.  We attack NOW!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell acknowledged the message, and relayed it to all the
<br />
Hover Units.  Five seconds later, the fleet screamed toward the
<br />
probe with all available power.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right before Robotnik's arrival, Sonic and Sally were trying to
<br />
find the autodestruct key on the time machine.  They were unable
<br />
to commit themselves to any further searching, for Robotnik,
<br />
Packbell, and the entire Delta SWATBot Group were practically
<br />
face-to-face with them.  Before the two Freedom Fighters could
<br />
snap out of shock from Robotnik's sudden appearance, they were
<br />
apprehended by two SWATBots and bound together  back-to-back by
<br />
a security shackle.  Sonic and Sally struggled to escape, but
<br />
the electromagnetic field was too powerful to permit any hope of
<br />
departure.  Robotnik laughed his evil laugh of glee when he saw
<br />
the two attempt to escape.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's no use, Hedgehog.  Your speed won't get you out of this
<br />
one very easily.&quot;  Robotnik was definitely enjoying this.  He
<br />
continued in his best poetic tone to Sally, &quot;And you, Princess. 
<br />
Why do you struggle so?  It would only serve to bruise your
<br />
beautiful body, not to mention leave me with noone to be my
<br />
consort.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally cringed visibly and spoke in her best acidic voice, &quot;In
<br />
your dreams, Doctor!  I'll be your consort when you get a life!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, what a pity.  I thought that I might actually be able to
<br />
trust you two.  'Later', I thought,&quot; Robotnik said only in a
<br />
slightly derisive tone.  &quot;Oh, and I almost forgot.  Thank you
<br />
for providing me with the information I need to the Key to
<br />
Mobius,&quot; he said, bowing in his most gracious bow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was Sonic's turn to add a rebuttal.  &quot;Yeah, we'll give you
<br />
the Key to Mobius, Robuttnik,&quot; Sonic replied with a sneer on his
<br />
face.  &quot;We'll shove it down your throat after we use it to lock
<br />
you up in prison for good!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Slightly, but only slightly, taken aback by Sonic's comment,
<br />
Robotnik thought over what his next action should be.  Stroking
<br />
his mustache, he quickly thought of another way to deal with the
<br />
two brash young  Freedom Fighters.  Finding one, an evil smile
<br />
crept over his face, making it more than apparent to Sonic and
<br />
Sally that their fate would not be favorable to their survival.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Very well, then,&quot; he finally said to them.  &quot;How about we make
<br />
a deal?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally spoke for herself and Sonic.  &quot;We don't make deals with
<br />
criminals, Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wait until you hear the proposal, Princess,&quot; he said to Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;After a thoughtful pause, he continued on.  &quot;I challenge you to
<br />
determine your fate on your own.  If you, Hedgehog, are as fast
<br />
as you believe yourself to be-&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An interruption by Sonic.  &quot;Faster than you'll ever know,
<br />
Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As I was saying,&quot; he continued, unflagged by Sonic's remark,
<br />
&quot;if you're fast enough to escape from me, I'll make certain that
<br />
you are allowed to return to Knothole and warn your friends
<br />
about this weapon.  If not, well, let's just say you never will.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mutual shock emanated from Sonic and Sally.  It had to be a
<br />
trap, but what if Sonic was able to dash away from Robotnik's
<br />
Delta Group and safely return to Knothole.  The prospect stung
<br />
in Sonic's side, since it seemed to me more a question of pride
<br />
than anything else.  This was as Robotnik intended.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sal, I gotta do it,&quot; Sonic whispered to his companion.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Right, Sonic,&quot; she answered back.  &quot;You know as well as I do
<br />
that this could be a trick.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic resonated his voice to sound suave, and said, &quot;Come on,
<br />
Sal.  I can outrun anything that Robuttnik has.  Trust me.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh, I hate it when you say that,&quot; was her only response.  She
<br />
consented to the challenge, however.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Excellent,&quot; said Robotnik in a voice that sounded like the cat
<br />
that was about to catch the canary.  &quot;Now that we are in mutual
<br />
agreement, I shall let you perform your part of the bargain.&quot; 
<br />
To the SWATBots, he ordered, &quot;Set them free.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One second later, the EM field disengaged and the metal bar was
<br />
lifted from the prisoners.  Now free of the bonds, Sally quickly
<br />
jumped into Sonic's arms.  The hedgehog accelerated in place for
<br />
about a second, and then was somewhere else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robotnik, however, wasn't about to let them escape so easily. 
<br />
He signaled to Packbell to engage the weapon.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A yellow beam flashed between the temporal displacement final
<br />
emitter and Sonic's position.  In the distance, Robotnik could
<br />
hear the screams of the two, possibly the initial effects of the
<br />
time transport.  A few seconds later, they were present no more.
