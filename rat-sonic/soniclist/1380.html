<br />Part 5
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse didn't even bother knocking.  Sally nearly dropped Nicole in 
<br />
surprise as he burst into her hut.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, what in the---?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails is gone!  Packbell took him!  Look at this!&quot;  He handed the pad to 
<br />
Sally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She read it.  &quot;Oh no.  Where's Todd and Antoine?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Antoine's back at his hut.  Todd...  He went after them.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He did?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There was nothing I could do!  He said he knew where the building was and 
<br />
then he took off before I could stop him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rubbed her forehead.  &quot;This is *not* good.  Okay, go get Sonic.  We 
<br />
must act quickly.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was soon there, and the three worked out a plan.  Sonic gave his 
<br />
usual suggestion.  &quot;I say we go bust him out now!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sonic, you don't have any power rings, remember?  You used them in your 
<br />
little show yesterday, and the next one's not for another three hours!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I can run fast enough without 'em, and we need every second we got!  No 
<br />
telling what Packbell will do if he sees Todd alone!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally had to admit Sonic was right.  &quot;Okay then, we should get going.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic shook his head.  &quot;You're staying here, Sal.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I beg your pardon?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Look, this isn't some carefully planned mission.  It's gonna be dangerous 
<br />
and I don't want you getting hurt.  Let me handle 'im like only I know how.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally thought and again admitted to herself that Sonic had a point.  They 
<br />
shouldn't risk both of their lives on this one.  &quot;Okay, but you're not going 
<br />
alone.  I suggest that you take Bunnie with you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Bunnie's sick, remember?  She got a cold.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally rubbed her forehead again.  This was looking worse with each passing 
<br />
minute.  &quot;Alright.  Tolouse, will you go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse had little desire to face Packbell again, but he would not hesitate
<br />
to help Tails or Todd.  &quot;Of course.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Good.  Okay, get going!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;C'mon, Tolly!  Let's juice!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally watched from her doorway as the blue streak melted into the woods.  I
<br />
don't know why, she thought, but I have a bad feeling about this.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd tore through the woods, his years spent on the run allowing him to 
<br />
keep up a brisk pace.  As he ran, his mind was also in high gear.  There were 
<br />
many memories: his home, his mother, the years spent with Sebastian and the 
<br />
others, and finally, his time at Knothole.  It seemed that at the end of each 
<br />
happy memory, there was a traumatic one waiting to be relived, and in every one,
<br />
Robotnik or Packbell played a central part.  There had been many times like 
<br />
this, when the memories played themselves out, and each time, Todd's hatred of 
<br />
Robotnik and Packbell had grown, and not a day had gone by that he didn't dream 
<br />
of making them pay for what they had done -- by any means, at any cost.  Had 
<br />
Sally and the others known just how immense this hatred had become, they would 
<br />
certainly have worried about him.  It is sometimes impossible to tell just how 
<br />
far one will go when all other goals, all other thoughts have been tuned out, 
<br />
save one.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This time was different, though, for he had not one goal, but two.  Tails 
<br />
was his friend.  He considered the young two-tailed fox to be one of the closest
<br />
friends he'd ever had.  Packbell's going to pay for ever even thinking of 
<br />
kidnapping him! he thought.  Todd would stop at nothing (NOTHING!) to make sure 
<br />
that no harm came to Tails, and that Packbell would suffer for what he'd done.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, I swear to you, on my mother's grave, you WILL NOT GET AWAY THIS 
<br />
TIME!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He pushed himself harder, running as fast as he could.  Finally, he found 
<br />
himself outside what used to be the Mobotropolis Museum of Arts.  He was the 
<br />
first to arrive.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tails shivered in silent fear, wavering in and out of consciousness, as 
<br />
Packbell busied himself at a portable terminal, making sure that his other 
<br />
duties were taken care of and that he would not be missed while his plan was 
<br />
being carried out.  They were in the main display hall, where the works of 
<br />
Mobius's legendary artists had once resided.  The museum had been neglected 
<br />
during the time of the Great War, and one of King Acorn's hopes had been to have
<br />
the museum restored back to its full glory when the war ended.  Robotnik, of 
<br />
course, had had other ideas when he staged his coup, and now the building was 
<br />
just one among many others, decaying and forgotten in the outskirts of the city,
<br />
far away from the main activity of Robotnik's factories.  Which, of course, made
<br />
it an excellent place for Packbell to carry out his plan without any worry of 
<br />
Robotnik interfering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell checked the status of his projects, as well as the of the 
<br />
rebuilding of the coolant treatment plant.  Good, everything is on schedule, he 
<br />
thought.  By this time next week the plant will be operational again, and I can 
<br />
finally turn my attention to---
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Packbell!&quot;  A voice broke the silence.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell turned around and saw a lone fox standing in the distance 
<br />
entryway.  He casually stood up and picked up his laser rifle as he said, &quot;And 
<br />
who are you?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You should remember me, Packbell, after what you and Robotnik did to me.  
<br />
And my mother!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, of course, had every face that he had ever enountered memorized, 
<br />
but even for an android it is easier to recall some faces more than others, and 
<br />
he didn't feel the need to waste time scanning his memory for this particular 
<br />
one.  &quot;Spare me the bad monologues and tell me why you are here, and I might let
<br />
you live that much longer.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I have come for my friend Tails and to make sure that you are never able 
<br />
to pull anything like this again.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only one fox, and not one of the main Freedom Fighters at that?  This was 
<br />
not the rescue party Packbell had figured on.  Perhaps the others were on their 
<br />
way, and for whatever reason this one decided to strive ahead.  Personal 
<br />
vendetta, maybe.  Packbell chuckled to himself.  There's one in every crowd, and
<br />
they all got what they deserved eventually.  Now, however, was not the time.  
<br />
Holding the rifle with both hands, he said, &quot;I'm afraid that you are a little 
<br />
more than helpless to retrieve your friend here.  As you can see, he is quite 
<br />
restrained and any motion towards him or me will be quite painful, I can assure 
<br />
you.  Now, run along and make sure your friends are here by sundown, or there 
<br />
will be no hope of rescuing him.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This quick dismissal was certainly not what Todd had expected, and his 
<br />
anger began to boil, consuming him.  &quot;NO!!  I will NOT be ignored so easily, do 
<br />
you hear me?!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell, now irritated, turned back around.  &quot;Did you not understand me?  
<br />
Get out of my sight!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You will face me, NOW!  You owe me that much for all the misery you have 
<br />
caused me!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something about this one, Packbell thought.  He's different.  So, he 
<br />
scanned his mind, and eventually came across the memory of a young kit during 
<br />
the time of the initial coup.  He gave Todd a chilling grin.  &quot;Ah, now I 
<br />
remember you, and I must admit I am impressed that you are still alive.  You 
<br />
know, I have to tell you it was a lovely sight seeing Dr. Robotnik deal with 
<br />
your mother the way he did.  Seldom does he get that involved in dealing with 
<br />
prisoners, and it is always a pleasure watching him when he does.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd trembled.  &quot;Shut up!  I swear you will pay for that!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell sneered.  &quot;I told you to spare me the speeches.  I can easily 
<br />
guess what you're here for.&quot;  Packbell then thought for a moment.  &quot;But can you 
<br />
imagine what I am here for?  Have you stopped to think about why I kidnapped 
<br />
your young friend here when I could just as easily have taken any or all of you 
<br />
last night?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd refused to listen.  &quot;All I know is you are not going to get away with 
<br />
it!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell chuckled.  &quot;Oh, I think I will.  Let me tell you my plan...&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, two more figures had slipped quietly into the display hall, from
<br />
an entranceway on the opposite side of the room.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There they are,&quot; Tolouse whispered.  &quot;And look, there's Tails!&quot;  He 
<br />
pointed to where the unconscious fox sat tied to his chair.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic looked.  &quot;Packbell's got his back to us, and it sounds like he's 
<br />
bending Todd's ear.  C'mon!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Where're we going?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're gonna get Tails out of there super fast.  Then we'll get Todd and 
<br />
blow this hole.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The two crept stealthily over to Tails and began working on his restraints.
<br />
Much too close for comfort, Packbell continued detailing his plan to Todd.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...You see, far more times than I would care to remember, your precious 
<br />
Freedom Fighters have succeeded in their plans, resulting in their continued 
<br />
existence as well as the destruction of much of Robotnik's property.  I began 
<br />
looking for ways end their luck, and I believe I have found one.  What do you 
<br />
think would happen to the Freedom Fighters if they witnessed both the kidnapping
<br />
and...&quot; he paused, chuckling, &quot;...the killing of one of their closest and 
<br />
youngest friends, right in front of them, while they were utterly helpless to do
<br />
anything about it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd shuddered.  &quot;You would really... just to see how they would react?  
<br />
They would do everything they could to destroy you!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell chuckled.  &quot;I think not.  Why, to have their free-spirited friend 
<br />
here *crushed* before their very eyes?  How would they sleep at night?  How 
<br />
would they be able to look at themselves in the mirror?&quot;  He took a step towards
<br />
Todd.  &quot;And, how would they fight?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You-- I won't let you do this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell chuckled and said with a hideous whisper, &quot;Watch me!&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was sweating bullets.  &quot;Sonic, are you done yet?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;One more to go, bud.  Here, help me with this...yeah, that's it.  Now 
<br />
pull.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse pulled, and the final restraint gave way, but not silently.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CLICK!!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, gods...
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell turned, his eyes instantly focusing on the source of the sound, 
<br />
and then on Sonic.  &quot;You!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic was quickly on his feet.  &quot;Yeah, me.  Who'd you expect, the cleaning 
<br />
lady?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell was in even less of a mood for Sonic's attitude than normal.  He 
<br />
raised the laser rifle.  &quot;I guess I will just have to execute my plan that much 
<br />
quicker.  Say goodbye, hedgehog!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic prepared to dodge, but he noticed the rifle was not being aimed at 
<br />
him.  &quot;Huh?  Now wait a Sonic sec---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse's heart pounded as it looked like the rifle was pointed at him.  
<br />
&quot;Oh my---&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell focused his aim, ready to pull the trigger.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All thoughts and actions were broken by a scream.  Todd howled as he raced 
<br />
across the display hall.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened next took place in much less time than any of those present 
<br />
remembered it.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse darted sideways, bumping into Sonic.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic grabbed him and quickly pulled him down behind him, then reached up 
<br />
for Tails.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell hesitated slightly... ever so slightly... before pulling the 
<br />
trigger.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Todd jumped in front of Tails, still howling.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Packbell pulled the trigger.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blinding flash.  Thoughts of panic, wondering if these were the last 
<br />
moments.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The howling stopped.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he realized that he was still alive, Tolouse looked up.  &quot;TODD!!&quot;
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonic didn't waste anytime at all.  With adrenaline adding to his strength,
<br />
he scooped up Tolouse in one arm and Tails in the other, and raced out of the 
<br />
display hall before Packbell had another chance to fire.
<br />
<br />* * *
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was several minutes later before any of the participants were thinking 
<br />
clearly.  By that time, Sonic was passing the city limits with his two 
<br />
occupants.  Tails was easy to carry, as he was still unconscious.  Tolouse was 
<br />
another matter.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We can't just leave him back there, Sonic!  We can't!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There is nothing we can do,&quot; Sonic replied, all hints of his famous 
<br />
attitude gone for the moment.  &quot;I'm sorry.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They moved on, toward their destination of Knothole.
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was several minutes later before any of the participants, carbon-based 
<br />
or otherwise, were thinking clearly.  By that time, Todd was breathing his last 
<br />
breaths, and Packbell stood over him, exploding with anger.  Packbell was going 
<br />
over the events in his mind, and with each replay, his anger and frustration 
<br />
deepened.  He couldn't deny the truth to himself.  He had hesitated.  Todd's 
<br />
scream had distracted him, and although he recovered in a slim fraction of a 
<br />
second, it had been enough.  It had been enough for Todd to block his shot.  It 
<br />
had been enough to allow Tails and the others to escape.
<br />
Now here he was, watching the foil of his plan die at his feet, and still not 
<br />
getting any satisfaction from it!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He roughly picked up Todd and was ready to shout at him, to threaten him.  
<br />
But what could he say?  'I'll kill you for what you did'?  He was already dying!
<br />
All he could think to say was, &quot;Don't think I'll stop here.  Take to your grave 
<br />
the knowledge that I will win!  Do you hear me!  I *will* win!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Todd didn't respond to that.  Instead, he mustered all of his remaining
<br />
strength to raise his head, look Packbell eye-to-eye, and whisper one last 
<br />
sentence, which he did with a smile.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I beat you.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then his head fell, and Packbell knew there was nothing more he could do or
<br />
say to scare or hurt Todd.
<br />
<br />To be continued.
