<br />
Stories, music, art, etc. have been developed for a very long time.  Only 
<br />
the most avant garde works have a chance at being totally original.  
<br />
Almost everything does something that's been done before, whether 
<br />
intended by the author or not.  In the case of music, the courts have 
<br />
already ruled that all possible combinations of notes have been 
<br />
exhausted, so now it's not necessary any longer to prove absolute 
<br />
originality in a defence in a copyright infringement suit.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; be--carnivores.  The series sidesteps this problem by infantilizing the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; foxes, keeping them at a child (at best, adolescent) stage of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; development.  These anthropomorphs' ancestor is, of course, Bugs Bunny,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; whom Richard Adams once dismissed as &quot;a guy in a rabbit suit&quot; who had
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; nothing to do with real rabbits.
</em><br />

<br />
He must be less familiar with the games than even I am.  Tails is &quot;almost 
<br />
five&quot; except for being ten years old in the Saturday series.  For DIC to 
<br />
portray Tails as an adult would be a non-sequitor, an inconsistency with 
<br />
the characters' point of origination (the games).
<br />

<br />
As for Bugs Bunny, why does he have to be a like a real rabbit?  Ooooh, 
<br />
six minutes of Bugs Bunny silently hopping around a meadow.  That'll keep 
<br />
us in hysterics.  (Reference to &quot;Slappy Goes Walnuts&quot; intended.)  
<br />
Likewise, why do Tails and Antoine (and Sally??) have to be like real 
<br />
foxes?  If they were, Bunnie wouldn't have a chance if not for her 
<br />
robotic limbs.  And since Sally is (more than likely) a squirrel, she'd 
<br />
be in trouble too.  As explained in Schneider's book, the Looney Tunes 
<br />
and Merrie Melodies were made &quot;cartoony&quot; in direct opposition to Disney's 
<br />
preference to realism.  If you prefer realistic animation, fine.  Pick up 
<br />
&quot;Bambi&quot; and &quot;Snow White&quot; at your local video store.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; As for the lead Sonic characters, there doesn't seem to be much one can
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; do with them except use them for their original purpose; the series is,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after all, a half-hour commercial for Sega.  The Boss [Robotnik?] is
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; one-dimensional, but Sonic, Sally and the other forest-folk barely make
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it to two-dimensional.  If I had to write anything for these critters,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I'd have to invent a lot of biography and motivation along the way.  The
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; character design is nice, but (a) the studio is borrowing Sega's designs
</em><br />

<br />
What you're asking for is an original series, not a show based on the 
<br />
game.  If you re-invent the characters, you end up with something like 
<br />
the movie &quot;Halloween III: Season of the Witch&quot;:  a movie that has nothing 
<br />
to do with its predecessors except title.  You think there are 
<br />
differences between the two cartoon series, the two comics (US and UK), 
<br />
and the games now?  Just imagine the games being what they are now, and 
<br />
the SatAM show using only humans and taking place in New York City, and 
<br />
Robotnik is just a powerful man in the drug trade.  May as well scrap the 
<br />
game connections and make a totally new show.
<br />

<br />
There's also a matter of the budget.  The show would be very different if 
<br />
it were made by Disney (perhaps passed along to Touchstone) where much 
<br />
more could be spent on writers, animation, and so on.  Any list.members 
<br />
care to speculate on what the show would have been like if another studio 
<br />
made it?
<br />

<br />
The cartoon-commercial issue was debated extensively about ten years 
<br />
ago when we were treated to plotless cartoons like &quot;Strawberry Shortcake&quot; 
<br />
whose sole purpose was to sell-sell-sell.  At least &quot;JEM&quot; had some good 
<br />
music now and then.  &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; is a giant step up from there.  
<br />
The Sonic cartoons and comics have helped to develop the concept further 
<br />
and faster than the games.  Sega can't release a new Sonic game every month.
<br />

<br />
Of course, the connection to an item of merchandise is there; it's 
<br />
inseperable for this show.  But I don't think it was made to be a 
<br />
commercial any more than specifying my e-mail address in my .signature is 
<br />
an attempt to solicit customers for United States Internet, Inc.  Do you 
<br />
see in my .sig, &quot;For the best in Internet connectivity, contact USIT at 
<br />
---&quot;?  Do you see any blatant sales pitches in the show?
<br />

<br />
Robotnik, boss only to Snively, should be a limited character.  It would 
<br />
dilute the story if he only roboticized those who commited capital 
<br />
crimes, or if he were to apologize for what he does as he does it.  If 
<br />
Robotnik was just a component of a schizophrenic Julian, well, we'd have 
<br />
a more complex story and a less formidable opponent.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Beyond that, and their essentially adolescent perspective, Sonic and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sally still pretty much embody the gender stereotyping of commercial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; television: she's Appollonian, the planning aspect, while he's the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; active, unthinking Dionysian counterpart.  You rarely see a female
</em><br />

<br />
&quot;Commercial television&quot;, hmmm, last time I checked my TV listings, my 
<br />
local PBS affiliates weren't running Sonic.  You can't blame your tires 
<br />
for being round.  I'd rather see this configuration than one like Cliff 
<br />
Huxtable who's just an amiable buffoon (just how did he manage to get 
<br />
through med school, or high school for that matter?).  Sally might have 
<br />
the &quot;brains&quot; but she alone can't carry out her plans, with the possible 
<br />
exception of her mini-series (she did have help from St. John).  Remember 
<br />
the episode where Sally blamed herself for not adequately planning an 
<br />
attack and some Freedom Fighters were roboticized?  Sounds like something 
<br />
I'd do too.  But Sonic was there to support her, and *together* they made 
<br />
it through.  Sega's bio of Sonic says he's of average intelligence (see 
<br />
/pub/sonic/list/sonic-bio at the ftp site) and he tends to be impatient.  
<br />
Remember when Sonic said he would do what &quot;I do best:  wing it!&quot;?  Sonic 
<br />
wouldn't even want Sally's &quot;planner&quot; role.  Not unless you re-invent him, 
<br />
and now we're back to may as well make an original series.
