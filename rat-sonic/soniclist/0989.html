Issue 25 still hasn't made it to my local stores.  At least I finally got 
<br />
it in the mail today.  The cover was silver, as I expected, but for some 
<br />
reason I thought it was going to be on stiff paper like another comic did 
<br />
recently (X Men, I believe).  If using regular paper meant no price 
<br />
increase for this issue, I guess I shouldn't complain (g).
<br />

<br />
The remainder of this message contains information regarding the story in 
<br />
Issue 25.  If you have not read this issue and don't want to know 
<br />
anything about what's in the issue, stop now.
<br />

<br />
For those of you still with me....
<br />

<br />
I noticed Amy and Sally are shown as two seperate characters.  I was 
<br />
always under the impression that Amy was in Sally's role outside of the 
<br />
Archie comic and the Saturday (and weekday?) cartoon.
<br />

<br />
Amy is clearly in pursuit of Sonic.  As Sonic refers to her as a pen pal, 
<br />
Sally would likely know about her and Sonic does not seem be as 
<br />
interested in her as she is in him.  By the reference of &quot;little girlie&quot;, 
<br />
I would imagine Amy is younger (maybe Tails's age), so she may be more a 
<br />
&quot;groupie&quot; than a serious competitor to Sally.
<br />

<br />
We've seen in the Saturday cartoons how Sonic is not very enthusiastic 
<br />
about getting into a relationship, even though it's always been a &quot;given&quot; 
<br />
that Sonic and Sally are an item.  But Sally hasn't been as bubbly over 
<br />
Sonic as Amy was in this issue either.
<br />

<br />
(Getting to sound a bit like a soap opera, isn't it? (g))
<br />

<br />
Could Sally get tired of Sonic's nonresponsiveness and give up?  I'm sure 
<br />
Antoine hopes so.  If she does, that leaves the door wide open for both 
<br />
Antoine (Sally, if she decides she's interested) and Amy (Sonic).
<br />

<br />
Could Sonic be up next for a &quot;Love Showdown&quot; issue?
<br />
