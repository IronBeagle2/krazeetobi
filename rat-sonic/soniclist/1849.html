Subject: Nothing for Granted: Author's comments
<br />

<br />
Hello all.
<br />

<br />
Several people have asked me why I wrote &quot;Nothing for Granted&quot; the way I did,
<br />
and I figured that the list would be the best place to reply to them all.
<br />
For those who don't care, just skip this. :)
<br />

<br />
People seem to have been worried about me ever since I claimed that &quot;On My
<br />
Mother's Grave&quot; was my last story and at the same time, I stopped role-playing
<br />
as Tolouse on FurToonia.  Then, when I said I didn't wish for anyone else to
<br />
use Tolouse in their stories, they felt I was being selfish and angrily accused
<br />
me of such.  Now that &quot;Nothing for Granted&quot; is out and Tolouse is dead, they
<br />
have claimed that I destroyed a great character all because of that depression
<br />
and selfishness.
<br />

<br />
First of all, let me say why I felt that OMMG would be my last:  I had run
<br />
out of story ideas, quite simply.  The ideas for the first three stories all
<br />
hit me within a few weeks of each other, but then, months later, when I finally
<br />
got the last one finished, nothing more had come up.  I am not the type who
<br />
can sit down and crank out stories like some authors can; I have to let them
<br />
come to me.  Otherwise, it feels forced, or it just doesn't happen at all.
<br />
Also, I quit role-playing Tolouse on FurToonia because of this:  I never was
<br />
very much into RPGs, MUDs, Magic and other such card games, or any of that.
<br />
I decided to try it in FurToonia because I was an avid fan of Sonic stuff.
<br />
But my interest in the RPing waned, and I felt that to stay around in an
<br />
environment that I had little interest in would only be wastin my and
<br />
everybody else's time.
<br />

<br />
As for why I didn't wish others to use Tolouse in the meantime:  Back when
<br />
I first came up with the idea for the character, I knew how I would want
<br />
to write him.  David Pistone knows a little about this, as I explained to
<br />
him what I figured Tolouse's chronology would be in the stories back when I
<br />
first met him as Bookshire in FurToonia.  So, even tho' I didn't plan on writing
<br />
any more at the time, I did want to keep the window open so that I could write
<br />
the character the way I wanted to.  I guess at this point I should apologize
<br />
for claiming OMMG was my last when I should have said that it was simply the
<br />
last I had planned at the time.
<br />

<br />
Now, about NfG:  This isn't the way I had originally planned for Tolouse to
<br />
have his final journey.  But the more I thought about it, the more I liked it
<br />
better this way.  Mobius is going through a war right now.  So much is
<br />
happening, and so much can happen.  The good guys will not always come through
<br />
unscathed.  Even the simplest of victories will have casualties, and those
<br />
casualties could just as easily be the characters that you feel nothing would
<br />
happen to, rather than the &quot;walk-ons&quot; that exist only for the purpose of getting
<br />
bumped off.  In other words, in a time of war, take nothing for granted.
<br />

<br />
Well, I hope this clears a few things up, and I hope that I am not the most
<br />
hated person in Sonic fan-fic, now.  It would be a shame to think that I
<br />
created enemies simply because of a fictional character. :)
<br />

<br />
