<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;From: drazen_at_andrews.edu (Dan Drazen)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Date: Tue, 28 Mar 1995 16:16:30 -0500 (EST)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;To all those who have commented on Bloodlines:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;[Note: if you haven't read the story yet, we're talking major spoilers
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;coming up here]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Courtesy form-feed:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     In all honesty, I had no idea that Bunnie and Sandy's relationship
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     would take the turn it did when I started writing.  I had no
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     intention of outing Bunnie or anyone else.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I guess my basic reaction is that it's out of character (show reference: 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; after Uncle Chuck's temporarily deroboticized, she tells Sally maybe she 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; should &quot;take another look at that man...&quot;) _and_ it wasn't really necessary 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to the story line (IMVNSHO).
</em><br />

<br />
To be perfectly honest, I'd have to agree to both parts of the above. If 
<br />
anything, Bunnie has a certain affinity for Sonic in the cartoons, which 
<br />
she carefully controls since her best friend is Sally....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Obviously I wrote this before reading &quot;The Power of Love,&quot; and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     before Netscape was installed on my machine so I could discover
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     how large a part Bunnie plays in the Mature [or should that be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     &quot;IMmature&quot;?] Fan Art section of Rotor's homepage.  
</em><br />

<br />
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I don't want to know...
</em><br />

<br />
Only one of the GIFs I'd say you might be offended by, Ron.... (contract.gif)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;I was sort of afraid that some of her drooling fanboys would take umbrage.
</em><br />

<br />
I was bothered, if only that she was taken out of character. There was no 
<br />
basis for this in the story up to that point (too sudden)...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Maybe I deserve that, although Babs Bunny will still be #1 :^)
</em><br />

<br />
Yes, Babs is still a far better draw for me, but Bunnie is not very low 
<br />
on the list... :)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Actually, I wasn't all that offended, probably because I've seen worse on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; alt.tv.tiny-toon (speaking as a survivor of the great TTBS flamewar...), 
</em><br />

<br />
At least we *tried* keeping the characters in character... (I know what 
<br />
we TTBSers did was not to your taste. No apologies are needed for that on 
<br />
our part, but we do respect your feelings. That's why .fandom was 
<br />
created. Apologies, however, if *that* sounds terse- I'm really not the 
<br />
best communicator that I could be...)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; plus I didn't get as attached to Bunnie as I did Babs, plus it had been a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; long day between Good Friday services and pretty much deciding I was fed up 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; with my job enough to see if there are any better ones out there (anybody 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; need a digital/analog circuit designer? :^)), so I was more or less too 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; tired to get upset when I finally got around to reading it last night :^)
</em><br />

<br />
Can't help you with your job-seeking, although I'm trying to work on an 
<br />
NTSC-PAL video conversion project with Jono Nicholson in the UK...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;     Hope nobody got too bummed by my allowing Queen Alicia to die.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Well, it was pretty much expected, but it was still quite sad - especially 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Sally's reaction...  I'll confess I got a bit teary-eyed at it, which 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; bothered me because it was yet another reminder that I am moved more by the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; suffering of imaginary characters than I am my fellow man.
</em><br />

<br />
That means the story's working... :) Seriously, I'll agree with Ron that 
<br />
that's what was to be expected. No, wasn't bothered by that at all... 
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;Thanks for putting up with my ramblings.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And mine :^)  I meant none of the above criticism personally, nor the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; following:  I guess I'm a bit disappointed that with the exception of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, all of the fan-fic so far has more or less been on the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; grim side (especially the latest stuff with Packbell).  While I admit I do 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; like the dark theme of the Sat. AM show itself, at least most of the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; episodes have enough hope in them that this tempers things a bit.  I don't 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; seem to see this in the fan-fic.  But far be it from me to tell people what 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to write - if I decide that it's not worth discussing the comics (that and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the fan-fic are about all that's left to talk about), I can always 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; unsubscribe...
</em><br />

<br />
I can really agree with the above: the series had HOPE, and this does 
<br />
seem to be lacking in the current crop of stories, even though the 
<br />
stories themselves are rather well-written. To those writing: please try 
<br />
to work on the &quot;human element&quot;, OK? I want to feel more for the 
<br />
*characters*, rather than seeing just what the latest plot to foil 
<br />
Robotnik is... Also, it's going to be just as much an adventure to 
<br />
rebuild Mobius and regain control of the throne....
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; PS to my non-list CCers: if you want a copy of the story, e-mail me -
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; I still have it for now.  I haven't decided how long or if I'll keep it 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; though...
</em><br />

<br />
Ron's been bouncing them my way, BTW... Rotor's web site already has the 
<br />
stories.... (Hey, Rotor! The site hasn't changed much in the last month, 
<br />
except when you added Bloodlines... I know one story has been posted to 
<br />
a.f.s-h, but I didn't save it, knowing it would be on the site- I was 
<br />
wrong...)
<br />

<br />
Enjoy Nature's rejuvination, everybody! :)
<br />

<br />
....Quozl!
<br />
