<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; And while I'm at it, Spyhog had Uncle Chuck shedding tears at the end, and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; another show (or the same one?) had Sonic bringing him a chili dog which he 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; ate, enjoyed, and burped up - huh?  Neither of these should have been 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; possible in his robotic form although the tear scene was touching...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Because they're not fully robots- There is still sufficiant remains of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; their biological forms to accomplish things... (It's more a means of 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; slavery than anything else, since Robotnik could've just as easily had 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; robots *manufactured*, instead of roboticising everyone...)
</em><br />

<br />
I thought Uncle Chuck WAS fully robotocized.
<br />
Of course, this could open up a new thread as to how the robots go about
<br />
repleneshing their energy supplies.  Drawing a similarity here, Data on
<br />
ST:TNG has the ability to eat, and, depending on what books you read and
<br />
which episodes you watch, he can even glean certain nutrients from the food
<br />
that help his android components.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;No, the games don't have any vending machines.  A few slot machines, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;though.  And giant pinball games.  And monitors with special powers 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev3">&gt; &gt; &gt;inside.  And Purina Island...  (:3
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; So where did the chili dogs come from then?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; What, it seems implausible to you that a certain type of food would last 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; out 1500 years? ;) Better forget your lox &amp; bagels tonight... ;) Heck, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; the *pizza* has been around for nearly 1000 years, but only in the last 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 200 years in the forms we know it today.... Most Mexican dishes can be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; traced back to pre-aztec times, *at least* 1500 years...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
And so, we come back to my favorite debate :-).  Exactly where and what
<br />
is Mobius.
<br />

<br />
Like several people (including myself) have argued, the date references should
<br />
not be used to support Mobius being a future Earth.  For one thing, it
<br />
would be impossible for one species of animal, let alone the multitude we see
<br />
on Mobius, to evolve into sentient, self-aware creatures in less than 2000
<br />
years.  Now, it is possible that this is actually an Earth set several
<br />
million years in the future, after humans have blown themselves into
<br />
oblivion and the Earth started over with other animals (after all, doesn't
<br />
the sun have about 5 billion years of life left?), which use a date system
<br />
based on an event other than Christ's birth (the Second Coming, perhaps? 
<br />
well...let's not get into Mobian religion just yet :-)...)  But then how
<br />
would one go about explaining the many things that just happened to appear
<br />
once again?  Chili dogs?  France?  The English and French languages?  And
<br />
what about the magic of Mobius, such as the Time Stones or 'The Void'? 
<br />
Also hard to explain in a future Earth.
<br />

<br />
I still say that Mobius exists in a universe parallel in many ways to our
<br />
own, and that Mobius is the Earth of that universe.  I'm currently working
<br />
on a whole background to support this and expand on it, which I will use
<br />
in some stories that I plan to write.  Of course, all this will take place
<br />
when I finally get to see the cartoon series myself.  (Thanx once again,
<br />
David, and continued curses against Channel 2 and ABC in general.)
<br />

<br />
Did you know that not only a 'Dumb &amp; Dumber' cartoon, but a 'Ace Ventura'
<br />
and 'The Mask' cartoon are also planned for next season?  &lt;&lt;GROAN&gt;&gt;
<br />

<br />
