<br />
<br />Timeline: A few weeks after Joseph's crash.  Several days before Doomsday.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />The sun rose over the Great Forest.  Light began to stream through the
<br />
trees, giving the forest a primordial feel.  The wind began to lightly
<br />
caress the treetops, as the birds began to sing.  Squirrels jumped from tree
<br />
to tree, looking for a meal.  Fish lept out of the water to consume the
<br />
early-morning cloud of gnats that hovered above the life-giving fluid.  
<br />
These were the usual sounds of the morning, that had been heard on Mobius 
<br />
since time primeval...except for one.
<br />
<br />Deep within the forest, within a mist-covered clearing, a figure silently
<br />
began his morning exercises.  He stretched and flexed his muscles, allowing
<br />
sinew to slip pass bone in the proper fashion.  He concentrated on the task
<br />
at hand as he took the traditional fighting stance.  He prepared himself 
<br />
for the physical exertion that was about to occur.  Centering himself 
<br />
spirtually and mentally as best he could, he locked onto his target and 
<br />
readied himself to the mission he had dedicated himself to.
<br />
<br />About 10 feet away from the solitary figure, there was set up a 6&quot; thick
<br />
piece of wood, cut into the rough shape of a very fat human.  It had a
<br />
target painted on the side of it, with its center resting in the middle
<br />
of the human's stomach.  It also had a cariacture of a smiley-face pasted
<br />
over where the head usually would be, with a bullethole through it.
<br />
<br />After taking a deep breath, he began the exercise.
<br />
<br />He did a series of forward flips toward the target.  But just as he came
<br />
into range, he vaulted over it, into the forest.  He hurtled toward a 
<br />
nearby oak, but precisely compensated for the change in course and 
<br />
lept off its trunk toward a vine.  He swung on the vine until he reached 
<br />
another tree.  He slid down the tree, cartwheeled away from it, and 
<br />
tucked into a spinning roll toward the target.  But again, as he became 
<br />
in range of it, he lept over it.  This time, he chose to grab a branch of 
<br />
the oak and did some various acrobatic exercises around it.  After he had 
<br />
orbited the appendage a few times, he quickly began crossing the clearing 
<br />
by pulling himself from various vines.  After a bit of this, he lept off 
<br />
one on the furthest side of the clearing, reversed himself in mid-air, 
<br />
and began cartwheeling, and then backflipping, toward the target for the 
<br />
final time.  When he entered attack range, he set up a perfect roundhouse 
<br />
kick, and beheaded the silly-looking dummy.  Immediately recovering from 
<br />
that, he executed a precise low punch to the target's main target, 
<br />
putting a fist-sized hole in the bullseye.
<br />
<br />With the target destroyed, the figure stepped back, took a deep breath, and
<br />
calmly cleaned up the remains of the target.  He broke it up into portable
<br />
strips, wrapped them into a bundle, and walked back off into the forest,
<br />
his morning exercises completed for the day.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />The figure, now having a good pile of firewood to use, wandered back toward
<br />
a path that had been beaten years ago to a village where he now resided. 
<br />
He had not been born in this village, nor even this world, but he had, just
<br />
from his brief time there, come to consider his new surroundings to be his 
<br />
home.  After all, his old home was no longer very hospitable; nor had it
<br />
been close to such a good training area as the one he had come from even
<br />
when it was.  
<br />
<br />He drew closer to the outskirts of the village, where his hut resided.  He
<br />
had built it himself several days ago, and he cared for it dearly.  It was
<br />
probably the most comfortable, warm, and homey home in the entire village,
<br />
thanks to the advantage of the advanced technology he had utilized in its
<br />
construction.  Within 2 days, it came to stand as it did that day,
<br />
beautiful and tranquil in the gentle light of the sun.
<br />
<br />Joseph loved his new home.
<br />
<br />The entire structure took up less that 10 feet in diameter to the naked
<br />
eye.  It was dome-shaped, and appeared to be constructed of a sort of
<br />
opaque brown glass, that perfectly camoflaged the structure from the air.  
<br />
Occasionally, there was a clearer spot that served as a window.  A small
<br />
chimney stuck out from the right side of the dome, giving it a even more
<br />
surreal appearance.  However, a ordinary-looking native sidewalk led from 
<br />
an area a few feet from the home to its front portal.
<br />
<br />To him, it was a &quot;little cottage&quot; that his people could have generated in 5
<br />
minutes; it had taken him several days to properly replicate all of its
<br />
features with the small amount of power left on his ship.  To the
<br />
inhabitants of this planet, however, it appeared as a wonder of the world;
<br />
a nigh-invulnerable fortress that no evil could breach.  Well, at least
<br />
nothing on this world could, Joseph thought.
<br />
<br />Smiling, Joe meandered toward the sidewalk he had constructed, and walked up
<br />
it back toward his front door.  Opening it with a single word, he strode in to
<br />
unload the pelf he had carried from deep within the Great Forest, and to
<br />
clean himself up for the day.  Placing the bundle of firewood in the
<br />
fireplace, he shut the door behind him to consider the state of the home
<br />
Joseph had constructed with his own paws.
<br />
<br />It was a tidy home, being spartanly furnished with only a few chairs, a
<br />
couch, and a practically empty bookshelf.  A monitor displayed the area
<br />
outside his house on a screen to the left of his door, with a small speaker
<br />
beneath it that served as an intercom.  The floor was hard wood, but the
<br />
walls were constructed with the same glassy material that the exterior
<br />
possessed.  A few windows allowed light to drift in from the outside, and 
<br />
a hallway led off in front of him to the kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.  
<br />
Next week, Joseph thought, he would furnish the bare basement with a
<br />
laboratory, so to make his time here more constructive.  
<br />
<br />But, for the time being, he was content with what he had.  However, he was
<br />
hungry, and his organics could use some hydrogen combined with oxygen in a
<br />
liquid state at roughly 40 degrees.  So not to lessen the ship's energy 
<br />
further by replicating food for him, he decided he would cook up some 
<br />
&quot;grub&quot; (as the blue one called it) for breakfast.  His organic systems 
<br />
would certainly appreciate it, after the workout Joseph had recently put 
<br />
them through.
<br />
<br />He walked into the kitchen, and pulled out a object that served as a rough
<br />
&quot;mug&quot;.  It was actually a hollowed-out sapling stump he had found a 
<br />
few days after he had &quot;decided&quot; to stay here, but he had sanded, 
<br />
shellacked, and generally waterproofed the thing enough so it would be a
<br />
decent container for food, drink, and such.  Smirking bitterly, Joe chided
<br />
himself for taking all of his tools with him from Ur'thae, but none of 
<br />
his utensils.  He grabbed it by its handle (a bent piece fof metal he had
<br />
stripped from the ruined communications array, screwed tightly into the 
<br />
side of the glass) and walked over to the sink.  
<br />
<br />The fact that this cottage had running water was one of its main advantages
<br />
over several of the other huts around.  Instead of going over to the well
<br />
like the natives did, he had brilliantly chose to directly tap the water
<br />
table, using some tubing he was able to replicate.  He had &quot;zapped&quot;
<br />
(another colloquialism taken from the blue one) a hole through the ground
<br />
to the area below the village that the well drew its fluid from, and 
<br />
installed a long pipe into it.  Then, he set up a pipe that released
<br />
the wastewaster from the home, placed a purifier onto it, and had the
<br />
output flow into a creek.  Finally, he created a compressor unit (powered
<br />
by some ultra-efficient solar panels implanted in the roof), and
<br />
placed it on the pipe so it would draw water up from the underground
<br />
reservoir, and into his home.
<br />
<br />After he had drank a few glasses of water, he walked over to one of the
<br />
cubbords and removed a small, metal can.  Then, he took a iron-copper 
<br />
alloy pot from the counter (he had smelted it himself only a week ago),
<br />
and walked off into the den.
<br />
<br />He took a match from the shelf as he walked in, and struck it on a coarse
<br />
part of the glass wall.  Tossing it onto the wood, he waited until it
<br />
started to catch before opening the flue.  Then, Joe dumped the contents of 
<br />
the can (beans, apparently) into the pot, and placed it over the fire.  
<br />
Putting it on a stand, he hit a small switch by the fireplace to activate
<br />
the air filter at the summit of the chimnney.  He wouldn't want any aerial
<br />
scans to pick Knothole up, after all.  
<br />
<br />Estimating the time for the contents of the pot to properly cook at 10.4532
<br />
minutes, he decided to try and squeeze in his shower before breakfast.  He
<br />
wandered into the bathroom, removed his training gear, and activated the
<br />
makeshift shower.
<br />
<br />A blast of cold water slowly sublimated to cool as the figure gave himself
<br />
a through scrubbing.  His mind began to loosen up as he mulled over the
<br />
tasks he had to accomplish that day.  The only thing he needed to do was 
<br />
get more things from the ship.  Joe also wanted to study more throughly the
<br />
behavior patterns of the Mobians, and observe a &quot;power ring&quot; being formed.
<br />
Nothing earth-shattering, but enough to keep his mind busy.
<br />
<br />He finished his shower and walked into a drying stall.  A 10-second blast
<br />
of specially charged atoms later, and he was dry.  Then, he put on some 
<br />
clean clothes, and checked on the progress of his breakfast.  Ah, he
<br />
thought as he reentered the den, the beautific stench of bubbling beans 
<br />
before brunch.  They were just about done, and done precisely the way he
<br />
liked them; hot.  Taking a bowl from the counter, he poured some of the
<br />
contents of the pot into it, and quickly placed the pot on a rack where 
<br />
it would not damage the rest of the area.  After he had accomplished that, 
<br />
he took a small wooden spoon from one of his pockets, picked up the
<br />
steaming bowl of legumes, and walked back outside.
<br />
<br />Knothole was looking particularly wholesome today, Joseph thought as he
<br />
continued eating his beans.  It must be a psychic counterbalance to the
<br />
evil of Robotropolis, he assumed, and took another mouthful.  He strode 
<br />
along the main &quot;street&quot; of the village, looking for any signs of activity. 
<br />
Most of the village was still asleep.  Joseph noted again that the village 
<br />
was usually completely shut down from roughly midnight to about 6:15 in the
<br />
morning.  He hoped to one day be able to pin down the total time of 
<br />
dormancy to milliseconds.  But, that would not be today.  He sensed
<br />
activity coming from one of the huts.  He believed it was of the entity
<br />
called &quot;Tails&quot;; a pre-adolescent two-tailed fox that Joseph liked a great
<br />
deal.  Joe saw a lot of himself when he was that age in him.  Intelligent,
<br />
polite, inquisitive, yet somewhat naive.  But that was to be expected.
<br />
He sensed that Tails would one day be a very important individual in the
<br />
future of this world.  Then, he noticed Tails slowly wander out of his hut.
<br />
He wasn't quite awake yet, so Joseph chose to avoid him until he became 
<br />
fully sentinent.  (Joseph had also noticed very few Mobians were &quot;morning
<br />
people&quot;.)
<br />
<br />Continuing his walk through the village, he noticed that Sally had
<br />
obviously been active almost as long as he had.  Sally was also a person
<br />
Joseph could somewhat identify with.  She was a driven individual, very
<br />
buisness-like and unrelenting in her pursuits.  Yet, she could be
<br />
excessively kind and warm to someone as well.  Being the proper ruler of
<br />
Mobius, Joe reasoned, she must feel a great responsibility for the welfare
<br />
of the remaining, non-robotizied citizens of Mobius.  She was currently
<br />
preparing breakfast for herself and Tails, and was probably expecting Sonic
<br />
to come along, too.  She was obviously busy, so he quietly slipped by her
<br />
hut and furthered himself along his way.
<br />
<br />Rotor was just finishing his breakfast, Joseph noticed as he walked by his
<br />
hut.  He was one of the rare people Joseph could talk shop with, and have
<br />
the other party reply in kind.  They both loved to fix things, build
<br />
things, and make objects more efficient.  He respected Rotor a great deal.
<br />
In fact, Joseph thought, he was coming to feel Rotor was the brother he 
<br />
never had.  He decided to drop by his hut, and see how he was.
<br />
<br />Rotor waved to the tall, orange vulpine as he ducked his way inside his
<br />
hut.  &quot;Hey, Joe.&quot; he said, as he gestured for Joseph to take a seat.  
<br />
&quot;How are you doing this morning?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh,&quot; Joe said, &quot;I'm just fine.  I was just going on a walk around the
<br />
village when I noticed you were awake.  Got up early today, eh?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Me?  Nah,&quot; Rotor said, &quot;this is the time I like to get up.  I feel more
<br />
creative at either the extreme beginning of the day, or the middle of the
<br />
night.  Figured I might come up with something new to make.&quot;  He sighed.  
<br />
&quot;I've been in a bit of a dry spell lately.  I don't know, maybe I've been
<br />
working too hard.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Joseph smiled.  &quot;I wouldn't worry too much about it, Rotor.  Everyone has
<br />
their ups and downs.  Just relax and let it happen.&quot;
<br />
<br />Rotor was about to say something else when a shout echoed through the hut. 
<br />
&quot;Rotor!!&quot; a female voice yelled, &quot;Muh arm is stuck again!&quot;  Rotor looked
<br />
over at his guest.  &quot;Oh jeez,&quot; he muttered, &quot;Bunnie's arm locked up again. 
<br />
I just don't know what she does to it to kink it up so much.&quot;  He looked
<br />
out the door and yelled, &quot;Be right there!&quot;.  
<br />
<br />Joseph smirked.  &quot;It's okay, Rotor.  Go do what you must do.  I'm gonna
<br />
keep walking around the complex, anyway.&quot;  Rotor nodded, and rushed out 
<br />
the door, tools in hand.
<br />
<br />Joseph walked out of the hut, continuing to eat his beans.  After walking
<br />
another brief distance, he came across Antoine's impeccibly maintained hut.
<br />
Antoine was one of the Mobians Joe could only identify with by means of
<br />
extreme metaphor; both he and Antoine were out of place here.  But even 
<br />
then, it was stretching the comparison a tad far, because Antoine was 
<br />
alien even to people who had known him since birth.  At least to fellow
<br />
Ur'thaens he was normal...on the eastern continent.  He listened, and 
<br />
realized Antoine was still grooming himself.  It seemed like every time 
<br />
Joseph saw him, he was grooming himself.  Wouldn't his skin start to hurt 
<br />
after a while?  Honestly, he thought, his fur should be like silk from all
<br />
of the combing and primping that it had to endure.  He decided to leave 
<br />
before he started talking to him in that strange alteration of Mobian he 
<br />
was fluent in...
<br />
<br />Suddenly, he heard the sound of a fast-moving individual zipping around a
<br />
few huts down.  Sonic had finally woken up, and he was doing his morning
<br />
&quot;juice run&quot; to wake himself up.  Seconds later, the blue blur blasted by
<br />
him, causing a large cloud of dust to fly into Antoine's hut.  
<br />
<br />Antoine staggered out of the hut, coughing.  &quot;Sonick!  I'll get vous for
<br />
zat!&quot;  He gesticulated blindly back toward his dusty hut.  &quot;It will take me
<br />
the days to clean dis up again!&quot;  Joe took this opportunity to leave, while
<br />
Antoine was still blinded by the plume of dust.  He was still shouting when
<br />
he got out of range of his bellowing, and wandered back into the forest.  
<br />
<br />Ah, the quiet of the forest, Joe thought, finishing his beans.  He walked
<br />
up to a stream and rinsed out his bowl in it.  Drying it off with his
<br />
shirt, he put it in one of his larger pockets and continued on his way.
<br />
He looked up into the sky.  By the position of the sun, he'd say it was
<br />
about 8:25.  Just about time for a power ring.  He started walking up the
<br />
path to the power ring pool, where Sonic would probably end up shortly.
<br />
<br />He walked over to the pool, and took a seat on a rock.  He looked into the
<br />
pool.  A dull yellow glow was visible near the bottom of the pool.  The
<br />
ring would surface in 3.4 seconds.  He was expecting to hear the sound of 
<br />
the hedgehog roar up here, snatch the ring, and zip off again.  However, he
<br />
must have been delayed, because the ring rose unaccompanied by a blue
<br />
flash.  It was floating there, waiting for someone to grab it.  Joseph
<br />
realized someone better grab it before it sank again.  He reached out his
<br />
hands--suddenly, four words drifted in front of him, a warning message--
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt; DIRECTIVE TWENTY SIX ALPHA &gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />--and his body catapaulted itself back into the bushes.  A second later,
<br />
Sonic blasted up the path, grabbed the ring, and rushed back to Knothole
<br />
before he could even notice the orange heap laying in the woods.   Joseph
<br />
groaned from the sudden automatic movement, and stumbled to his feet.  What
<br />
had just happened?  Had the power from the ring shorted out his neural net?
<br />
If it had, then what did that message mean?  Joseph was confused.  He
<br />
needed to ask Bahb about this.  He ran back into Knothole, and was
<br />
beginning to worry about the new development..
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />He jogged back toward his home.  Trotting through the village, he was
<br />
unnoticed by the inhabitants, who were busy starting their chores for the
<br />
day.  Then, a voice called his name.  &quot;Joseph!&quot; the voice shouted, &quot;could
<br />
you come here for a minute?&quot;  It was Sally.  Wondering what she needed of
<br />
him, he walked toward her hut.  
<br />
<br />Entering the hut, he realized Sonic, Sally, and Tails were in the middle of
<br />
breakfast.  Tails was sitting on the left side, and Sonic was on the right.
<br />
Sally was sitting on the far end.  It was apparently oatmeal with 
<br />
strawberries today.  It looked rather appetizing.  Tails waved to Joe as 
<br />
he walked in, unable to talk with his mouth full of whitish slush.  Sonic 
<br />
had, naturally, completed his bowl, and was somewhat more talkative.
<br />
&quot;Yo, Joe.&quot; he said to the tall fox as he ducked his way into the home.
<br />
<br />&quot;Greetings, boss.&quot; Joe jokingly called Sally `boss' because of a
<br />
translation problem he had initally had with the word &quot;princess&quot;.  In
<br />
Ur'thaen, the word &quot;p'hrincese&quot; meant &quot;overlord&quot;; seeing that Sally was not
<br />
the current overlord of Mobius, he had taken the next logical step and
<br />
called her by a synonym of &quot;overlord&quot;, &quot;bhoss&quot;.  Later, when he had
<br />
consulted Sonic about it, he realized the error.  Sonic and Sally 
<br />
smirked as Joe then proceeded, as usual, to bow slightly.
<br />
<br />&quot;You can just call me Sally, Joseph.&quot; Sally laughed, &quot;There's no need for
<br />
such formality.&quot;  She gestured for him to sit in the vacant chair at the
<br />
close end of the table.  As he sat down, Sally continued talking.  &quot;So,&quot; he
<br />
spoke, &quot;how are things going for you here?  Do you need anything?&quot; 
<br />
<br />Joseph smiled.  &quot;I require nothing,&quot; he said, &quot;I have everything I need to
<br />
survive on my ship.  I can imbibe Mobian water, and consume Mobian food. 
<br />
My home has been constructed, so all I require of you now,&quot; He smiled and 
<br />
winked at Sally.  &quot;Is your kindness.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic quipped, &quot;We've got that in high supply, dude.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph grinned at the blue mammal.  &quot;I figured as much.  You have been so
<br />
kind to me, I don't know how to make it up to you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Well,&quot; Sally interjected, &quot;there *is* something we'd like to ask you.&quot; 
<br />
She looked over at Sonic.  &quot;Sonic, why don't you do the honors?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic smirked.  &quot;Sure, Sal.  Joe, my man, why don't you join us in our
<br />
fight against ol Ro-BUTT-nik?  You've got serious skills.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It would be an honor,&quot; Joseph bowed, &quot;to assist you in the uprising
<br />
against him.  Any assistance you require of me would be gladly given.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally smiled weakly.  &quot;That's...uh, great, Joseph!  I didn't think you'd 
<br />
be so enthusiastic about this.  After all, you don't live here.  This 
<br />
isn't your fight.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's mine now.&quot; he said plainly.
<br />
<br />Sally blinked.  &quot;Are you sure you want to get into this?&quot;
<br />
<br />Before Joe could answer, Sonic interjected, &quot;Sal, whaddya tryin' to do,
<br />
change his mind?!?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sonic,&quot; Joe said, &quot;I decided to help you the minute you people helped me.
<br />
I have no home to return to.  This is my world now, and I shall defend it.&quot;
<br />
<br />Suddenly, Tails, who had been quietly eating his breakfast for most of this
<br />
conversation, chose to state, &quot;But Mr. Joseph, I thought you could leave 
<br />
here at any time.  Didn't you say all you needed was more crystal power to
<br />
escape?&quot;
<br />
<br />The orange fox turned to the younger, two-tailed one, and then to the two
<br />
adults.  &quot;Tails,&quot; he spoke, &quot;Sonic, Sally...let me explain my prediciment 
<br />
to you all.&quot;  He stood up, and went into speech mode.
<br />
<br />&quot;My world was merely a more positive reflection of what Robotnik wants
<br />
Mobius to be.  Our people gave up their flesh in return for immortality.
<br />
Sure, there was no pollution, death, disease, or famine; but Ur'thae also
<br />
lacked peace.  The flesh battled steel.  Religion fought science.  Brother
<br />
dueled brother...all over the quest for eternal consciousness.  The only way
<br />
my planet lasted for as long as it did after the creation of the neural
<br />
transfer device was because of the continental division.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;The first part of my life, I saw this war from Robotnik's side 
<br />
(to a certain extent).  Now, I live among the flesh, and I see that my
<br />
father was the creator of an evil too great for mortals to handle; affordable 
<br />
immortality.  At first, it seems to have no downsides.  Improved strength,
<br />
speed, senses, agility, and your mind never loses its edge.  You can
<br />
continue learning and experimenting for aeons.  The pleasures of the flesh
<br />
never dull...in fact, they sharpen due to computerized enhancement.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But, my father never realized that someone could use this ability for evil
<br />
purposes...to enslave another by &quot;roboticizing&quot; (as a somewhat similar
<br />
practice is called here) him or her.  He never saw that a part of ones
<br />
nature would rebel against it, and eventually even out the score.  They 
<br />
escaped death for a while, but in the end they all paid the ultimate
<br />
price for their crime against nature.&quot; 
<br />
<br />&quot;No, it is better to die in the flesh than live forever in steel.  I will
<br />
fight Robotnik for you because of this...he has tried to duplicate my
<br />
father's formula for immortality by using Sir Charles'--your uncle,
<br />
Sonic--roboticizer.  But he poisons himself and others by this...he has his
<br />
slaves, but he realizes not that the flesh and steel cannot live in the
<br />
same body.  If he is not stopped, this world will suffer the fate of
<br />
Ur'thae; a Fountain of Youth powered by blood.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;So, Sally, I offer my services to you.  Command me, and I will comply. 
<br />
Robotnik must be stopped.  At this point, all else is irrevelant.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally, Sonic, and Tails could only blink.
<br />
<br />&quot;Joseph,&quot; Sally whispered, &quot;you are gladly accepted into the Freedom
<br />
Fighters.  I see now that you are honest in your statements.  Your services
<br />
to us will be valued.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph bowed.  &quot;Thank you, Sally.  May I be excused?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally nodded, and Joseph left the hut silently.
<br />
<br />After he had gotten out of earshot, Sonic whispered, &quot;Man!  That guy is
<br />
intense!&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally nodded.  &quot;Yes, Sonic...he is certainly driven.  He must feel he has a
<br />
whole world to avenge.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I'd say!&quot; Tails piped, &quot;I can't wait to see what HE does to 'Butt-nik.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic muttered, &quot;So do I, Tails.  He looks like he could do some *serious* 
<br />
damage to some SWAT Bots.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I wonder what's going through his mind right now?&quot;
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />He continued back toward the dome that served as his domicile.  The brief
<br />
interlude with the leaders of the FF didn't make Joseph forget what had
<br />
happened by the power ring pool.  It intrigued him.  Could it be that this
<br />
planet had a power source greater than his internal power core?
<br />
<br />He entered the dome and walked over to the now-smoldering remains of his
<br />
fire.  He tossed the bowl on the table, and walked over to the Bahb 27290-A
<br />
Unit, affectionately known as Bahb.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Bahb,&quot; he said, &quot;I need info.  Talk to me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Ready for command.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Define Directive 26-Alpha.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bahb hummed quietly for a minute.  &quot;Classified.  Cannot access externally.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Surmise a hypothesis on how to acquire this information.&quot;
<br />
<br />Bahb beeped and tweeted as it ran through every possibility.  &quot;Required
<br />
materials are on the ship.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What do I need?&quot;
<br />
<br />Bahb began rattling off names of various components within the ship.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Over the next few days, the village eyed their new arrival suspiciously.
<br />
His main occupation seemed to be removing all of his computer equipment
<br />
from the ship he had crashed in, and installing them in the basement of 
<br />
his amazing home.  He would say what his purposes were, nor why he did not
<br />
keep them on the ship.  Some believed he was going to sabotage Robotropolis
<br />
completely.  Others, that he was going to destroy Robotnik's communications
<br />
grid.  A few just thought he was finishing unpacking; but everyone had an
<br />
opinion.  
<br />
<br />Joseph was, in actuality, preparing his new computer lab for two reasons;
<br />
to continue his work, and to discover the secret of Directive 26-Alpha.
<br />
Joe also could no longer leave all of his hyperadvanced technology in the
<br />
middle of the woods in good faith...the ship had drove off several gawkers
<br />
in the last few days.  But he told no one of his experience at the power 
<br />
ring pool, nor of the mysterious malfunction.
<br />
<br />Finally, 4 days later, the ship was totally gutted of its vital systems,
<br />
and was nothing more than a husk of its former self.  It was still cloaked,
<br />
but there was no longer any point in trying to steal it.  Joseph had
<br />
installed the power cells of the ship in the basement of his home, as well
<br />
as the communications systems and the main computer.  His domicile was now
<br />
a flightless version of the ship he had entered this world with.  A few 
<br />
more mining expeditions gave Joseph as much power as he could possibly use,
<br />
and then some, and he had tuned the house itself into a large antenna.  
<br />
<br />He was finally ready to attempt to find out the secret behind the
<br />
directive.  Preparing the dataspike, he sat down in a chair he had created
<br />
for this purpose, and jacked in.  Taking a deep breath, he prepared for the
<br />
total discombobulation that was to come with the scan.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bahb,&quot; he said again, &quot;define Directive 26-Alpha.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Accessing, Jo--.&quot;
<br />
<br />There was a great flash of light.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />When he could see again, Joseph found himself standing on the shore of the
<br />
Iundaeck Ocean, in front of the home he and his father shared back on
<br />
Ur'thae.  The twin moons shone down upon him in that glorious,
<br />
awe-inspiring violet sky.  The water was as clear and glowing as the first
<br />
day he had set eyes upon it.  The blue sand blew by his legs as the cry of
<br />
a lark whistled through the air, invigorating him.
<br />
<br />He was home again.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Jhosesophae.&quot;&gt;&gt; a voice said.  Turning around to face the voice, he
<br />
knew for sure this was his home.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Dhaevid?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The male was about as tall as Jhosesophae, with reddish-orange fur.  His
<br />
yellowing eyes denoted youth, yet the streaks of white in the fur showed
<br />
great age.  He was wearing a yellow lab coat, the mark of the Scientist
<br />
Prime on Ur'thae.  However, beneath the uniform, there was a pair of simple
<br />
slacks and a sweater, and a pair of whitish tennis shoes.  His hands were
<br />
metallic versions of the ones Jhosesophae had, but the voice was strictly
<br />
the unique baritone of his father's.  
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Yes, Jhosesophae.  This is me.  At least, a composite image of me strung
<br />
together from your own memory banks.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;I don't understand.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Let me explain, Jhosesophae.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The world flickers for a minute, and then switches to a different scene.
<br />
The scene now is of the room Joseph was transferred in, and the spaceship
<br />
docking ramp that was its only exit.  Dhaevid is typing something into a
<br />
keyboard while the android body is recieving its intelligence.
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Your story begins here, Jhosesophae.  While you were being transferred
<br />
to your new body, I was pre-programming your ship to take you to the planet
<br />
where you now reside...Mobius.  But I am getting ahead of myself.  I should
<br />
explain to you how I discovered this world, first.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
The world flickers again.  The picture returns on a starfield, where an
<br />
Ur'thaen ship is cloaking itself around an orbit of Mobius.  &lt;&lt;&quot;I
<br />
discovered intelligent life here shortly before your 16th birthday. 
<br />
Utilizing time warps, I was able to commute to Mobius and back home several
<br />
times a month without being noticed.  I was studying their advancement,
<br />
and...helping it a little.&quot;&gt;&gt;  Scene cuts to the workshop of Sir Charles
<br />
Hedgehog, and Dhaevid sneaking into it late at night.  &lt;&lt;&quot;One specimen 
<br />
interested me especially.  His name was &quot;Charles&quot;.  He was beginning to 
<br />
develop the technology that had made the neural transfer device possible...
<br />
the roboticizer.  A similar technology was developed by your grandfather 
<br />
356 years ago...anyway, every once in a while, I would sneak into his 
<br />
workshop and alter some of the equations to assist in the advancement of 
<br />
this technology.  He had the basic idea, but every once in a while he 
<br />
would make an unintentional error due to the misguided scientific theory 
<br />
of the time that I would quietly get him out of.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Scene cuts to Sir Charles constructing the device used to generate power
<br />
rings.  &lt;&lt;&quot;But, Sir Charles had also stumbled upon something that was far
<br />
beyond Ur'thaen technology.  This was the Power Ring Generator.&quot;&gt;&gt;  Scene
<br />
cuts to a diagram of the device, showing various graphs and projected power
<br />
fluxations next to it.  &lt;&lt;&quot;From my observations of Sir Charles' tests, this
<br />
device had the potential to generate enough power to penetrate the 
<br />
dimentional barrier; the one thing Ur'thaens could never breach, if
<br />
harnessed in the correct manner.  I'll tell you the truth, son, I have no 
<br />
idea how, why, or if it even *should* work.  Only the hedgehog knows.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The scene cuts to a picture of Sir Charles on the left, Sonic on the right,
<br />
and a power ring in the lower center.  &lt;&lt;&quot;This brings me to my final
<br />
request of you, my son.  Your mission is threefold; first, you must find 
<br />
Sir Charles, and assist him in any way he requires.  Work with him.  
<br />
Understand his devices.  This will allow you to escape the bonds of this
<br />
dimention, and become the first, and only, Ur'thaen to explore the other
<br />
universes that have been proven to exist.  Your second mission is to find
<br />
the nephew of Sir Charles, Sonic.  He can use the rings, according to Sir
<br />
Charles' notes and hypotheses, and perhaps he could teach you how to
<br />
properly use them as well.  Your final mission is to acquire
<br />
a power ring for yourself, and learn how to replicate more.  They are the
<br />
only way you will be able to travel from timestream to timestream safely
<br />
and efficiently.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />The scene cuts back to the beach.  &lt;&lt;&quot;This is all you need, or can know 
<br />
right now.  Alas, I know no more than this; my observation of Mobius was
<br />
cut short by the destruction of our world.  Good luck, my son; the last
<br />
survivor of Ur'thae.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;But..&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Everything went black.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />&quot;Scan complete.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph opened his eyes, and detached from the datajack.  Groaning, and
<br />
rubbing his throbbing skull, he spoke.  &quot;Computer, time elapsed from
<br />
beginning of scan to its completion.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;1 minute.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Deactivate dataspike.&quot;
<br />
<br />The system powered down.  Joseph laid back in his chair.  The situation had
<br />
changed considerably.  Now he knew why the power ring had effected him, but
<br />
a million other questions came to mind...
<br />
<br />After musing this over for a minute, he knew what he had to do.  Organizing
<br />
it into his directives list, he began to estimate how to best accomplish
<br />
them...
<br />
<br />Priority One:   Find Sir Charles.
<br />
Priority Two:   Find Sonic.
<br />
Priority Three: Acquire power ring; experiment.
<br />
<br />He had already guarenteed himself two and three just by being at Knothole.
<br />
However, he had never heard of Sir Charles being about.  This was
<br />
illogical; Sonic and Charles were family, and therefore Sonic wuld
<br />
probably, according to his observations, either find some way of honoring
<br />
him (if was deceased), or he would have brought him back to Knothole.  
<br />
<br />Seeing that he was missing something, he decided to confront Sonic about
<br />
the issue after dinner that night.  
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />After Knothole had been fed, Joseph wandered the village, looking for
<br />
Sonic.  He finally encountered the blue blaze sitting quietly by the power
<br />
ring pool, looking into the sky.  Realizing that Sonic was observing the
<br />
three moons of Mobius, he allowed him a few moments of silence before he
<br />
finally piped up.
<br />
<br />&quot;Where's Sir Charles, Sonic?&quot;  Joesph was always direct in his questioning.
<br />
<br />&quot;My unc's in Buttnikville, Joe.&quot; Sonic said, quietly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Why is he there?  I thought you'd try to get someone as brilliant as...I
<br />
heard he is...out of Robotnik's clutches.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He's our spy, Joe.  He hangs out, acts like a drone, but tells us
<br />
all about what happens there.&quot;  He glanced at his hands, dusting them off.
<br />
<br />&quot;Oh,&quot; Joesph said.  &quot;Wait a minute, I thought everyone in Robotropolis was
<br />
roboticized.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;They all are.&quot; Sonic spake.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well, how does your uncle spy on Robotnik if he doesn't have free will?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He's got his brain,&quot; said Sonic, turning toward him.
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't understand.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Look,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;My unc's been snapped out of Buttnik's control 'cuz I
<br />
waved a power ring in front of his face.  It somehow rewired his 'ol head
<br />
back to where it should be, and now he's cool.&quot;  He looked back to the
<br />
moons.  &quot;And someday,&quot; he whispered, &quot;he will be totally cool again.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Now I understand,&quot; Joesph said, &quot;but it's too bad he's in Robotropolis. 
<br />
I'd like to meet him.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic smiled.  &quot;Well, Joe, you'll be able to see him tomorrow night, when
<br />
he sneaks out of Buttnikville and gives us the weekly gossip.  You can chew
<br />
his ear off then, 'kay?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sure.&quot; Joseph said, smiling.  &quot;Thanks a lot.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No prob,&quot; Sonic said, and went back to staring off into space.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />The next morning, Joesph went about his training as usual, but the whole
<br />
while was thinking of how to explain to Sir Charles his prediciment without
<br />
alerting the rest of Knothole about it.  Surely if they knew they had been
<br />
visited by aliens for several months without being told, they would become
<br />
somewhat alarmed.  He knew the Ur'thaen governments wouldn't like it, so it
<br />
was without a stretch of the imagination that the Mobian government (the
<br />
real one) wouldn't appreciate it, either.  No, he did not want them to 
<br />
know anything about his father, the message he left, and the mission he 
<br />
was given until it was time.  Charles would understand.  He was sure of it.
<br />
They were fellow scientists, after all, and he felt that Charles might have
<br />
done the same thing if he was in his father's place.
<br />
<br />He spent most of the day meditating on what he would say to Charles.  He
<br />
wanted to be sure he knew exactly what had happened, and would therefore be
<br />
able to make an informed decision about what to do about it.  He mentally
<br />
composed a rather simple, logical essay on the whole situation, and
<br />
translated it into a speech that Charles could easily understand.  Then, he
<br />
reviewed it, looked for possible misperceptions, and altered them into a
<br />
more logical structure.
<br />
<br />When Charles arrived that night, Joseph was ready.  He let the aged
<br />
metallic hedgehog inform Knothole of what had been going on over the past
<br />
several days in Robotropolis, focusing mainly on something called Doomsday.
<br />
Joe stayed out of it, hoping to avoid becoming involved for as long as
<br />
possible.  He knew that one day his powers would be called upon, but he did
<br />
not want to get mired in this world's mess unless he knew that he would
<br />
have to remain here.  
<br />
<br />After Charles had finished, and the Knothole gang was involved in planning,
<br />
the eldest hedgehog politely excused himself, and began the long trip back
<br />
to Robotropolis on foot (Sonic couldn't zip him back, due to the amount of
<br />
security that had been placed around the area as of late.) Joseph began
<br />
following him.  Finally, after they had gotten out of visual range of
<br />
Knothole, he made himself visible to the kindly cyberhedgehog.
<br />
<br />&quot;Excuse me, but I need to tell you something.&quot;
<br />
<br />Charles lept back, startled.  &quot;Oh!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Please excuse my abrupt appearance, sir.  It is my custom to remain silent
<br />
unless absolutely necessary.&quot;
<br />
<br />Charles quickly regained his composure, and his eyes took a more pleasant
<br />
shade of red, if that was even possible.  After shifting around a bit, he
<br />
spoke.  &quot;Well,&quot; Charles said, &quot;if it isn't our star-travelling newcomer.  
<br />
I'd be happy to talk with you, son, but I really need to get back to 
<br />
Robotropolis before Robotnik misses me...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This is important.  It involves you, Sonic, and your invention.&quot;
<br />
<br />And then Joseph told him what he knew.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Charles could only blink.  &quot;So, what you're saying is that your father -- uh,
<br />
David, right? -- was the one who allowed the Roboticizer to be `perfected'?&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph nodded.
<br />
<br />&quot;And that the power ring generator is something beyond even your
<br />
technology, and you want to study it in order to further advance your dead
<br />
world's science?  You think it can help to deroboticize people?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes.&quot;
<br />
<br />Charles began to lose his composure.  &quot;Do you honestly expect me not to be
<br />
angered by this?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;No...&quot; Joseph uttered, becoming somewhat nervous.
<br />
<br />&quot;Good,&quot; Charles snarled, &quot;because I am.&quot;    He balled his metallic hands
<br />
into fists, and shook them at Joesph irritatedly.  &quot;Your father brought 
<br />
a curse upon this world by `helping' me create that damned machine! 
<br />
Millions perished because of its power!  Only a few hundred remain
<br />
untouched by its evil, and we lose more every day!&quot;  He spat upon the
<br />
earth, and angrily pointed toward the distant outline of Robotropolis.  
<br />
&quot;Is *that* what your world was like, Joseph?!?  A oligarchial `government' 
<br />
ruled by madmen, and supported by millions of robot slaves?  Is *that* 
<br />
what your superior world was like?  A souless, callous factory, existing
<br />
only to rape and loot your world?&quot;  His eyes shrunk to slits, and turned
<br />
bright crimson.  &quot;Is Robotnik merely a different version of your
<br />
*father*?!?&quot; 
<br />
<br />Joseph could withhold his rage no longer.  He had taken most of Charles'
<br />
outburst, but his slap at his father was unforgivable.  Raging, he
<br />
grabbed Charles by the throat, and lifted him high above his head.  As Charles
<br />
desperately tried to escape his grasp, and get some shots in, Joseph went
<br />
into a total spaz fit.  &quot;Do you THINK I'm *happy* about what has happened
<br />
here?!?  Do you BELIEVE that my father MEANT to ruin this world?!  He 
<br />
wanted to *HELP* you, you dottering old fool, by teaching you how to 
<br />
overcome the weaknesses of the flesh; without losing its advantages!  Your 
<br />
society would be as it was 15 years ago if it wasn't for the fact your 
<br />
PATHETIC bodies weren't wired so TOTALLY different from ours!  It's not 
<br />
MY fault, or even my FATHER'S fault that this happened!  Nobody is at 
<br />
fault here but Robotnik!&quot;  He looked toward the smoking, hazy industrial
<br />
hell, and shook Charles vigorously.  &quot;Don't you SEE?!&quot; he cried, &quot;It was 
<br />
a tragic MISTAKE that the roboticizer was miswired for this world's 
<br />
inhabitants, and the drive of that sadistic egg-sucking simian that made 
<br />
it the menace it is now!!&quot;
<br />
<br />Having exhausted his venom, he glanced over at the creature he had
<br />
captured.  His eyes watered with the cybernetic equivilent of tears. 
<br />
&quot;Boy...I'm sorry.  It's just that--&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph lowered him to the ground, becoming suddenly calm.  &quot;You don't 
<br />
need to apologize, sir.  I understand why you would have so much hatred 
<br />
for my father...it's just that, well, he and I were very close.  Ever since
<br />
I woke up here, I have had to deal with the grief of losing him, my 
<br />
friends, my world...&quot;  He fell silent, and wiped tears from his eyes.  
<br />
&quot;I don't want it to happen here, sir.  I'd never wish what happened to me 
<br />
on anyone...not even Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
<br />Somberly dusting himself off, the robotic hedgehog sighed.  &quot;I lost
<br />
control.  I shouldn't have snapped at you.  We both know that neither of us
<br />
are really at fault for what's happened here.  It's Robotnik who is to
<br />
blame.  He stole the plans, and he threw the coup.  Not me, not you, not
<br />
your father, but Robotnik.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You must have lived with so much guilt....&quot; Joseph whispered, &quot;having to
<br />
have lived for so long with the assumption that the device was all your
<br />
own.  I can relate to your feelings now, but there is no time for therapy
<br />
now.  Your world will be decimated unless we can find some way of reversing
<br />
the effects of roboticization.  I want to, and must help.&quot;  He looked
<br />
toward a certain star.  &quot;This is my home now.&quot;
<br />
<br />They stared into the sky for an eternity.
<br />
<br />&quot;I will give you whatever you need, and assist you in any manner that I
<br />
can,&quot; said Charles, &quot;and I promise you, none shall know of this until you
<br />
feel it is time.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Thank you, Sir Charles.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's no problem, son.&quot;  They shook hands, nodded, and went their seperate
<br />
ways.  Now both had a new variable to deal with; and some new hope.
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />Over the next few days, Charles would sneak out to the edge of the Great
<br />
Forest, and give Joseph as much information as he possibly could about the
<br />
roboticizer Robotnik had as he could.  Diagrams, circuits, anything that
<br />
might be important to the process, Joseph had by the end of a few days. 
<br />
Comparing it to the roboticization process he was familiar with, he was
<br />
able to understand how far he had to go in order to reverse the process
<br />
sucessfully...in theory.  
<br />
<br />However, he needed one of the power rings.  He couldn't just take one;
<br />
they'd ask what he wanted it for, and he didn't want to tell them yet.
<br />
Stealing one was out of the question.  He pondered this for a while.
<br />
Eventually, he simply moved on with his experiments by running simulations,
<br />
but they didn't have the important x-factor he needed calculated in; the
<br />
potential energy of a power ring.
<br />
<br />He moped around the power ring pool whenever he wasn't working, dismally
<br />
looking down toward the generator.  Charles couldn't help him build a
<br />
replica of it, because he had to destroy the plans when Robotnik took over.
<br />
Thus, he was just going to have to wait a bit longer...but he hated
<br />
waiting!  Lives were at stake.  
<br />
<br />One day, he just snapped.
<br />
<br />He timed the exact generation of a power ring down to a second, and
<br />
prepared himself to grab it.  As it began its ascent, he heard Sonic
<br />
coming.  Quickly, he positioned himself in front of the pool, so Sonic
<br />
would have to go through him to get it.  When the ring crested the surface,
<br />
he grabbed it just as the hedgehog arrived.
<br />
<br />&quot;Hey, Joe!&quot; he shouted, &quot;Gimme that ring.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph looked at him blankly.
<br />
<br />&quot;Well?  Give it.&quot;  He began to tap his foot impatiently on the ground.
<br />
<br />Joseph was in a rough spot.  He needed the ring.  Sonic wanted the ring.
<br />
He couldn't deny him it; it was his birthright.  Yet, he needed the ring
<br />
in order to complete his experiment.  Would it be better to tell him now or
<br />
later?  What to d--?
<br />
<br />&quot;Be that way, then.&quot;  Quickly, Sonic jumped up and wrapped his hand 
<br />
around the ring, and attempted to snatch it from his hand...
<br />
<br />And then, something quite unique happened.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
The nova effect covered both Sonic and Joseph.  Levitating them both into
<br />
the air, it glowed brighter than it ever did before.  Lightning crackled
<br />
from the bubble as the wind began to be sucked into it, and a low roar was
<br />
beginning to be heard around the area...
<br />
<br />There was a bright flash of light.

<br />[Joseph's internal chronological record of the next day or so is somewhat
<br />
fuzzy.  The following log was given to the historial record from Joseph's
<br />
own auditory reception.  No visual records of this period exist.  
<br />
Time has been estimated to the nearest minute.]

<br />+00 hours, 02 minutes
<br />
<br />&quot;Sonic!  Sally's look--oh muh stars!  HELP!!&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+00:03
<br />
<br />&quot;C'mon, help get him up, Rotor.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Boy, he's heavy.&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+00:10
<br />
<br />&quot;Do you think he'll be okay, Aunt Sally?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know, Tails.  Maybe he just needs to rest.&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+00:45 
<br />
<br />&quot;Joe!  C'mon, Joe, wake up!&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+01:25. 
<br />
<br />&quot;...he's got his eyes back...&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+02:00
<br />
<br />&quot;Ah cain't get into his house, Sally.  Bob's got it locked down.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Can't you explain to it what's happ--&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+02:56
<br />
<br />&quot;See what I mean?  Every once in a while, his eyes wi--&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+05:15
<br />
<br />&quot;He still hasn't moved, Sal.  I think he's de--&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+08:02
<br />
<br />&quot;And there it goes again!&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;He's not dead.  He probably wishes he was, tho.&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.
<br />
<br />+20:35
<br />
<br />&quot;Still there?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I guess so.  Look at him twitch.&quot;

<br />&quot;Wait!  Don't pus--&quot;

<br />
<br />+40:00
<br />
<br />&quot;I'm not goin' in there, Sal, and you can't make me.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But Sonic...&quot;
<br />
<br />Static.

<br />
<br />+47:00
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Reboot completed.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&quot;Sally...&quot;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Self-diagnositic cycle commencing.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&quot;What is it, Rotor?&quot;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Repairs complete.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&quot;Uhh...it's alive.&quot;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Sensor reacclimation complete.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />&quot;Tails!  Get out of here, now!&quot;
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;All systems at 100%.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />*sounds of people rushing out of the room*
<br />
<br />&lt;&lt;&quot;Visual systems reactivated.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br />
<br />Suddenly, all he saw was white as his visual sensors came back online.  In
<br />
a few seconds, they had properly reacclimated to the environment, and he
<br />
took some time to examine where he was.
<br />
<br />It was a hut, plainly decorated and felt somewhat sterile.  It was empty,
<br />
save for a bed and the small cloud of dust that was drifting
<br />
around...obviously, from the rapid departure of several parties.  He felt
<br />
no offense by this; they were being cautious.
<br />
<br />He hopped out of bed.  Standing upon the ground, he assumed that his
<br />
sensors were still malfunctioning; he felt about half his original height.
<br />
Activating his homing beacon, he began to follow the signal back to his
<br />
home, where he could do the necessary repairs.  He stumbled out of the hut,
<br />
and quickly did a scan.  Nothing.  They were all inside.  Seeing no
<br />
threats, he wandered back toward the trail that led back to his dome.
<br />
<br />As he stumbled back up the sidewalk that led to his home, he noticed he had
<br />
a lot of excess energy.  He wanted to run up the sidewalk, rather than
<br />
safely walking.  He pushed those strange thoughts out of his mind as he
<br />
opened the portal and walked into his home.
<br />
<br />A few minutes later, he was in his laboratory, and standing in the
<br />
diagnostic tube.  Activating the scan, he wondered what exactly had
<br />
happened to him.
<br />
<br />&quot;Joseph, sensors indicate a change on the subatomic level.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Is it damaging?&quot; Joseph was startled by the sound of his own voice.  It
<br />
sounded a lot like Sonic's.  The mimicry software was obviously still not
<br />
at 100%, he thought, and readjusted his voice (with some difficulty) 
<br />
back to the default.  
<br />
<br />&quot;Negative.  It has, however, increased your speed by 10,000%.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph was surprised.  &quot;Wow, that ring packs some punch.&quot; he uttered,
<br />
returning to his usual tone.  &quot;What other changes have occured?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;You have also begun to take on the characteristics of the entity called
<br />
Sonic the Hedgehog.  However, your internal systems are counteracting the
<br />
effects, and will have you internally back to default settings in another
<br />
day.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Bahb paused briefly, and beeped.  &quot;However, the visual effects are going 
<br />
to require additional power to counteract.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;What do you mean?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A visual apprasal has concluded that you appear to be Sonic.&quot;  
<br />
<br />Joseph was shocked.  This was why everyone was so frightened before!  It
<br />
wasn't just a sensory error...
<br />
<br />&quot;However, several things about you are far different than him.  Your quills
<br />
are orange.  Your eyes are silver, with no pupils.  You're wearing boots.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph was still in a daze.  &quot;How...?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Unknown.  Hypothesis suggests that the power ring, being suited for
<br />
Sonic's DNA, caused your biological systems to take on his genetic code
<br />
when he activated it.  You were knocked mostly unconscious during the
<br />
shock, and your internal cybernetics rushed to keep up with your physical
<br />
mutations.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph nodded, still in shock.  &quot;Do you think I can ever return to original
<br />
form?&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;Unknown.  Your inital transformation put a heavy strain on your internal
<br />
robotics.  It is very improbable that they could take such a strain again.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph decided to get away from generalities, which were beginning to
<br />
frighten him, and get back to specific problems.  &quot;Why are my eyes 
<br />
silver and pupilless, as you said before?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;When the intial blast occured, it blasted your original eyes from your
<br />
sockets, being that you were at ground zero.  It took exactly one hour
<br />
twenty minutes for new eyes to be created, and for them to fill up your new
<br />
eye sockets.  Unfortunately, they are not visually pleasing yet, because
<br />
your nanite repair system is still finishing up your primary systems.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;This concerns me, Bahb.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Affirmative.  However, it is a logical conclusion that you should probably
<br />
learn to cope with this form, because it's going to be yours for a while.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph mulled this over.  &quot;Yes, I suppose so.&quot;
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />A few more days went by.  Every once in a while, someone from Knothole
<br />
would come by, and try to see if any movment from Joseph's dome was
<br />
detected.  And every time, they noted nothing.  All anyone could hear was a
<br />
low hum.  Since no communication had been heard from the dome, they were
<br />
beginning to wonder how he was.  Sonic felt especially guilty, 
<br />
since he appearently caused it.
<br />
<br />&quot;It's my fault he went all haywire,&quot; he would tell Sally at length.  &quot;If I
<br />
wouldn'tve been in such a hurry, he'd still be around.  Now he's messed up
<br />
big time.  I wouldn't be surprised if he never came out again.&quot;
<br />
<br />And, for a while, he seemed to be right.  Nobody could get in, and nobody
<br />
had left.  They mused on his status.  Some said he had gone in there to
<br />
die.  A few clung to the belief that he was creating a new body to return
<br />
to his original form.  Most people, however, couldn't come to a conclusion
<br />
at all.
<br />
<br />Then, when they had almost lost all hope, the portal opened.  A figure 
<br />
left the dome, starting slowly, and then speeding up.  He went faster and
<br />
faster, and faster still.  When he reached the center of Knothole, a sonic
<br />
boom went off, and he roared through the forest toward the Great Jungle.  
<br />
Nobody had to say anything.  They knew what it meant.  Sally, after
<br />
glancing once at Sonic, knew exactly what was going to happen next.  
<br />
Seconds later, a second sonic boom went off, and both supersonic hedgehogs
<br />
were gone.  
<br />
<br />They raced around Mobius, over water, land, and chasm.  They burrowed deep
<br />
into the earth, swung on vines, and lept high into the air.  Finally, they
<br />
reached the summit of the highest mountain, and stopped their relentless
<br />
pursuit of each other.
<br />
<br />Joseph took a few breaths.  &quot;You are fast.&quot; said the orange blur.
<br />
<br />&quot;So are you.&quot; said the blue.
<br />
<br />&quot;I suppose you'd like an explaination.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, that would be nice.&quot;
<br />
<br />Joseph explained the entire preiciment to Sonic as best he could.
<br />
Trying to dumb it down enough for the relatively non-technical 
<br />
hedgehog, he tried to explain about his father, Sonic's uncle, and the 
<br />
power ring effect.
<br />
<br />&quot;So that's why you tried to steal that ring...&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; Joseph whispered, &quot;that is why.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I can see now why you wouldn't want to tell Sal and I about somethin' like
<br />
that.  Way past uncool.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes, it is.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;We wouldn't have hurt you for what your father did, Joe.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I could not know that for sure,&quot; he gasped, taking in more oxygen.
<br />
<br />&quot;You couldn't have, could you?&quot; Sonic mused.
<br />
<br />Joseph nodded, and moved on to the next thing on his mind.  &quot;I hope the 
<br />
blast didn't injure you.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Nah,&quot; Sonic said, &quot;it's cool.  Used up the whole ring, tho.  But I got
<br />
another one this morning.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;That's good.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yeah.&quot;
<br />
<br />The wind whistled through their quills, but neither of them seemed to mind.
<br />
<br />&quot;Whaddya gonna do now, Joe?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know.  I certainly can't help your world until I get my head
<br />
together.  I've seen too much in the last few days...I gotta go off and
<br />
think.  You can understand why.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Yes,&quot; he nodded, &quot;I can.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I must go.&quot;
<br />
<br />With that, Joseph rolled into a ball, and shot down the hill.  Sonic just
<br />
stood there, looking out toward the horizon, wondering...
<br />
<br />- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
<br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EPILOGUE
<br />
<br />Sonic returned to Knothole a few hours later, after he had gotten his own
<br />
head together.  He realized how very confused Joseph must be at that
<br />
moment, and put together a proper fabrication to tell the rest of Knothole
<br />
about it.
<br />
<br />He walked back to the edge of Knothole, where Sally was the first to 
<br />
confront him.  &quot;Sonic?  Where's Joseph?  What happened?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic looked plainly back at Sally.  &quot;He needs to be alone for a bit.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally gave Sonic a wicked look.  &quot;I *knew* that, Sonic.  What I mean is,
<br />
what happened?  Where did you guys go?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic leaned up against the wall.  &quot;Oh,&quot; he said, &quot;we just ran around for a
<br />
bit.&quot;  
<br />
<br />&quot;For three hours?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;It's a guy thing, Sal.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally started to become cross.  &quot;Look, just tell me whether or not he's
<br />
coming back.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;I don't know, Sal.  He said he's all messed up, and he's gotta juice
<br />
around until he knows what time it is.&quot;
<br />
<br />She sighed.  &quot;Well, I hope he comes back before something major happens.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic got up from against the wall, and put his arm around her shoulders.  
<br />
&quot;He will, Sal.  He just needs to be alone for a while.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But what if Robotnik captures him, and his technology falls into the wrong
<br />
hands?&quot;  
<br />
<br />Sonic suddenly began to smile.  &quot;'Butt-nik isn't gonna catch him, Sal. 
<br />
He's the 2nd-fastest thing on Mobius.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally shot Sonic a faux-questioning look.  &quot;And what, pray tell, is *the*
<br />
fastest thing on Mobius?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Want a hint?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;Antoine?&quot;
<br />
<br />Sonic acted shocked.  &quot;Oh, c'mon, Sal.&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;But who could be faster?&quot;
<br />
<br />&quot;A slug is faster than Antoine, Sal.&quot;
<br />
<br />Sally giggled.  &quot;Well, I suppose you're right.  C'mon, we better get back
<br />
to Knothole and explain what happened.&quot;
<br />
<br />They wandered back to Knothole, wondering of their friend's fate.
