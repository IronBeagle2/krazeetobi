&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epilogue
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Son-Ak was somewhat uncomfortable.  Fine clothes weren't his
<br />
favorite idea, even after these months in the Princess's court.
<br />
The magician, Antos, still didn't seem to like him any better, even
<br />
if he now trusted him.  Bunnie, at least, was now more of a friend.
<br />
The accidental rescue by the twin-tailed one had elevated a street-
<br />
thief to the court as a ward of the Crown, and his four friends had
<br />
been adopted, in a fashion, by the housekeepers of the Palace.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And all of them know that Roboth-Amon would strike again, for
<br />
dark wizards are known for their refusal to accept failure.  The
<br />
incursions of the golems at the borders were growing more frequent,
<br />
and there was still the matter of the shadowy figure that young
<br />
Milos had mentioned that night he had saved the Princess and met
<br />
Son-Ak.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Odd, that.  It had turned out that Milos was the one who had
<br />
purloined Son-Ak's purse, and far from being foes, the hedgehog had
<br />
soon found himself a object of hero-worship by the young vulpine.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A page-- the child-cat named Cleth, appraoched Son-Ak.
<br />
&quot;M'Lord,&quot;  he said, as though he was reciting a lesson-- which, in
<br />
fact, he was-- &quot;It is time.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And once again, as he had every day for the last three months,
<br />
Son-Ak drew a blue and red cloak over his new chain-mail, hefted
<br />
his axe (the only person besides Captain Rabbot to bear arms in the
<br />
presence of the Princess), strode up the aisle to the throne, and
<br />
took his place at the right-hand side, as the herald announced his
<br />
presence--
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lord Sonic of the Cad-Hai, Champion of the Crown.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Princess,&quot; Son-Ak whispered, &quot;Could you do SOMETHING to get
<br />
that fool to pronounce my name right?&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The End.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Rennaisance Mouse Production
<br />

<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, there it is.  Whaddya think, sirs?
