Live action movies have covered large geographic areas before.  
<br />
Ultimately, it comes down to &quot;how much do you want to spend?&quot;.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Which raises a whole plethora of new questions:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 1).  How would the movie be set in with the TV show/comic book?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Would you want a prequel (maybe telling the story of Robotnik's initial
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; take-over and how all the characters came to be where they are), an alternate
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; story (sorta like &quot;TMNT&quot; or &quot;Batman&quot; or just about any other super-hero
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movie), or perhaps a continuation of the cartoon (assuming the show doesn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; get renewed)?  The &quot;prequel&quot; is probably the least likely, since nowadays
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; movies have to have a definite ending, and preferably a happy one.
</em><br />

<br />
I think DIC would be one of or the prodcution company/ies, and they would 
<br />
probably not want to get too far off the existing cartoon.  And I think 
<br />
much of the audience would expect an extension of the TV cartoon.
<br />

<br />
It should begin with a brief exposition of Robotnik's coup to make sure 
<br />
the audience all know the information they need (and create sympathy for 
<br />
the &quot;good guys&quot;).  Open with a high-action scene that will grab 
<br />
everyone's attention and raise the tension high.  When the audience can't 
<br />
take any more, fade to black, pause a few frames, and fade in to the 
<br />
present.  Time:  around five minutes.  No credits over this scene!  For 
<br />
those credits that must be shown early, show some vista shots and play 
<br />
some suspense-building music.  Resume credits if necessary after fading 
<br />
back to the present.
<br />

<br />
We really can't have Robotnik KIA or that would close the story once and 
<br />
for all, unless someone else replaces him at/near the end.  But I don't 
<br />
think a cliffhanger would be appropriate for the movie.  Don't make him 
<br />
turn good either (no sugar-coated movie, please).  I'm not sure what 
<br />
would make a good ending, but it lies somewhere between those points.
<br />

<br />
Isn't it starting to look like the Sonic mailing list will be writing the 
<br />
script?  :-)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 2).  Who would do the voices?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Should we keep Jaleel and the rest of the gang, or take this opportunity
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; to expose some bigger names (Tim Curry notwithstanding) to the Sonic universe?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; Not that I'm trying to dismiss any of the Sat. morning stars.  I still have
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; yet to see any of 'em myself!
</em><br />

<br />
It should be mostly the same, so as not to shock and distract the 
<br />
audience.  Add a new character or two (but carefully, to preserve 
<br />
believability and overall story integrity) with a bigger name.  Due to the 
<br />
length of the movie, a new character might help quite a bit.  
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 3).  Who would produce the movie?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If Bluth were still making movies the way he used to, I'd want him in a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; heartbeat, but lately he seems burnt-out (&quot;Thumbelina&quot;?)  Disney making
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; it would be a double-edged sword; sure the animation would be top-notch,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; but the story might be a little too Hollywood.  And I don't want these
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; guys singing when there is a global war going on! :-)  What if a Japanese
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; company did it--Sonic anime?  That would be cool!!
</em><br />

<br />
I could see Disney farming that out to Touchstone considering Buena Vista 
<br />
distributes the video cassettes.  But I'm not sure about how much 
<br />
experience Touchstone has with animation, but I think they would handle 
<br />
the writing better than Disney.  DIC should have a more-than-mere-token role 
<br />
too.
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; And, of course, we could get really nit-picky and discuss who we want
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; for writer, music (orchestral, electronic, or pop?), music composer, etc.
</em><br />

<br />
For continuity, some music like that in the existing cartoons and the 
<br />
games should be used, preferably with a budget to get bigger-name 
<br />
songwriters and performers.  Pop can make the movie dated quickly, so be 
<br />
careful there.  I think some well-written and performed electronic music 
<br />
with some acoustic instruments would work nicely.  Don't make the 
<br />
electronic part draw attention to itself.  Find some quality songwriters who 
<br />
already know the story well and have them really show what they can do.
