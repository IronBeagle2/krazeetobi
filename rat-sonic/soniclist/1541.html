<br />
Here are my comments on Sonic 29, FWIW:
<br />
<br />I'll let somebody else summarize all the plot and credit details...
<br />
<br />Spoiler alert:
<br />

<br />
Well, I see they know how to give green eyes to _somebody_ (namely, Dulcy).
<br />
Now if only they'd get Bunnie's right...
<br />
<br />And isn't it convenient that the portable de-roboticizer would have only
<br />
_one_ charge left (and of course I assume they can't figure out how to 
<br />
recharge it or anything...)
<br />
<br />I'll let somebody else comment on how Antoine was holding Bunnie...
<br />
<br />Why should Sally have volunteered to be roboticized when Uncle Chuck's 
<br />
already there?  Or was this story set before he had regained his will? 
<br />
(Maybe the next issue will clarify this - Uncle Chuck's on the cover...)  
<br />
While I appreciate the comic's move towards the Sat. AM Sonic, I wish they'd 
<br />
note how it fits into the continuity, sort of like the Gargoyles comic is 
<br />
doing (or at least _was_ doing) with respect to the daily show.
<br />
<br />I don't know whether to be glad or disappointed at them not showing Sally's
<br />
roboticization - by not doing so, they spare us a possibly horrific sequence;
<br />
but OTOH this might have given the story even more drama...  And of course
<br />
the widget that was supposed to preserve her free will &quot;fell off&quot; during the 
<br />
process - again, how convenient.  Why didn't Rotor clip it to her or 
<br />
something?  (Or even stick it _in_ her ear?)
<br />
<br />Odd that the process preserved all of Sally's coloring...
<br />
<br />And while they at least showed _some_ struggle on Sally's part to obey 
<br />
Robotnik while roboticized, given her intense feelings for the Freedom 
<br />
Fighters (and presumably Sonic), I'd've thought she'd've struggled a bit 
<br />
harder and longer (maybe we can blame it on the shock of being 
<br />
roboticized)...
<br />
<br />But the art by Mawhinney and Koslowski was excellent as usual...
<br />
<br />The fan art isn't too shabby this time out (fanboys check out Sally's 
<br />
outfit); but I wouldn't think Bunnie and Sally are into tattoos and pierced 
<br />
ears, and Bunnie's _left_ arm is the robot one, not her right...
<br />
<br />Now onto the Tails story:
<br />
<br />That was a rather lame escape by Tails: using fur from his tails to clog up
<br />
the roboticizer???  They didn't look too threadbare after he got out, and I
<br />
would think anything that could handle a whole two-tailed fox could handle 
<br />
whatever loose fur he could shake off...
<br />
<br />I also find it hard to believe Tails' tails are strong enough for him to 
<br />
pull out a mechanical tree by the roots and swing it like a golf club (but 
<br />
it was still amusing :^)).
<br />
<br />That bit about &quot;robbing me of my _innocence_&quot; was a bit much - at the risk
<br />
of getting a bit crude, just how realistic _was_ that Fiona automaton?  (And 
<br />
note that the letter column for this issue has a quasi-explanation for Tails 
<br />
being 10 not 5, but 10 is still a bit young for this sort of thing, isn't it?
<br />
Or do Mobians hit puberty quicker than we do?)  And again, Tails' comment 
<br />
about &quot;my lost youth&quot; was a bit overdramatic; while it may be true, I doubt 
<br />
most people recognize the loss of their youth *when it happens* - I'd say it
<br />
takes years for it to sink in (and for us toon fans, maybe it never does :^)).
<br />
<br />And another cliche: the nearly-instantly-rusting-out-when-wet-robot; I
<br />
could've believed a short-circuit, but not rust.  And I don't know whether 
<br />
to applaud Fiona's final tear as a nice touch, or sneer at it as yet another 
<br />
predictable cliche...
<br />
<br />But the art by Manak and Harvo was fairly good; Tails really did look 
<br />
half-dead when Fiona was about to dunk him for the third time (although he 
<br />
seemed to make a typical toonish quick recovery from it :^)).  I hope they 
<br />
do as good a job in the Tails miniseries...
<br />
<br />Tidbits from the letters page: I'll let Dan Drazen flame the continuing 
<br />
office humor; Dylan is revealed to be a porcupine (then why didn't they name 
<br />
him Patrick or Percy or something?); Antoine is said to be 18 (then isn't 
<br />
Sally a bit young for him?  But he sure doesn't _act_ 18...); and Boomer was 
<br />
a former nickname for Rotor supposedly because of his voice (O-kayyyy...).
<br />
<br />I suppose all the above seems a bit harsh; I'll confess I've been in a bit
<br />
of a bad mood this weekend due to various things (not having a life being 
<br />
part of them), but I still think the observations above are valid.  Also, 
<br />
I'd rather have flawed stories like the above that at least try to live up 
<br />
to the Sat. AM Sonic, then the lame ones of the earlier days that weren't
<br />
much better than the daily shows.
<br />
