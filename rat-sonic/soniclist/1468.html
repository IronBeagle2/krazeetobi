Now, some may say this is off topic, but I just thought I'd share my 
<br />
views about the stuff they replaced Sonic with on ABC having just 
<br />
finished watching the Preview tonight:
<br />
<br />&quot;Madeline&quot;: 
<br />
Hmmm...if there's one show in the lineup that won't last til 
<br />
the end of the season, it's this one.  It vaguely resembles a VERY poor 
<br />
attempt to force kids to learn friendship, and kindness and give them the 
<br />
facade of what a wonderful place the world is.  Now, while I have no 
<br />
objection to such programming, a network saturday morning linup is NOT 
<br />
the place for it.  I mean, you'd expect to see somthing like that on PBS, 
<br />
but certainly not here!
<br />
<br />&quot;Free Willy&quot;:
<br />
This won out and Sonic did not.  As I said to myself at the beginning of 
<br />
the last season, this show isn't worth the money they put into it.  The 
<br />
movies were fairly good, but this cartoon adaption is nowhere near that 
<br />
good and is, in my opinion, filled to the brim with bad acting.
<br />
<br />&quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot;:
<br />
Well...that certainly describes the idea to make a cartoon like this.  
<br />
The show makes absolutely no sense.  And, while that may be the point, I 
<br />
think they made a big mistake in this case due to the fact that they're 
<br />
trying to make money off slap-stick anttics of two characters in a movie 
<br />
who really can't be duplicated.  I saw a preview of &quot;The Mask&quot; on CBS a 
<br />
few weeks ago, and that guy was nowhere near as good as Jim Carrey 
<br />
himself.  I fear such will be the case here...an uninteristing show about 
<br />
poor copies of two fine comedians.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bump in the NIght&quot;:
<br />
Finally!!  A show that makes it worth turning on the TV every week.  If 
<br />
this season is anything like the last, it'll be just as good.  The 
<br />
combination of the unpredictable Mr. Bumpy, the timid, practical 
<br />
Squishington, and Molly the comfort doll, make for wonderful 
<br />
entertainment.  Then, at the end, we get a trip to the Kareoke Cafe, 
<br />
which also proves to be worth not changing the channel.  Indeed, a truely 
<br />
unique and entertaining show. :)
<br />
<br />&quot;Fudge&quot;:
<br />
Well...I never really watched an episode of this, however, knowing the 
<br />
book, it's not something I'd enjoy.  Besides, I think a RL sitcom has NO 
<br />
place on a Saturday Morning show.
<br />
<br />&quot;Reboot&quot;:
<br />
Excellent!! The second reason to turn on the TV tomarrow.  This is a 
<br />
wonderful example of the way in which ALL cartoon will be made in the 
<br />
future.  reboot is groundbreaking, in-your-face computer animation which 
<br />
leaves that lame 'Incredible Crash dummies' short to shame, both in plot 
<br />
and fluid, yet quick movement of animation.  Reboot is truely a show 
<br />
worth watching if for no other reason than seeing the cool animation.  
<br />
Most people who do this stuff concentrate so much on the tech stuff that 
<br />
they forget about good plot lines.  Not so here,  Reboot is a superb 
<br />
combination of computer animation and wonderful, involving plots.
<br />
<br />&quot;What a Mess&quot;:
<br />
A story about a dog named 'What a Mess' who spend most of his time making 
<br />
a mess...is that it?  If so, we got the makings for yet aANOTHER show 
<br />
that won't last the season...even if it does it won't last to a second 
<br />
season.  The animation is poor quality, even though that was probably the 
<br />
animators' intent, and I honestly don't see much potential for story 
<br />
lines here if they don't get off the idea of simply a dog making a mess.
<br />
<br />&quot;Bugs Bummy and Tweety&quot;:
<br />
Well, this stuff has been on Saturday mornings as long as I can remember, 
<br />
and it's good stuff.  It obviously had to be to last as long as it has (I 
<br />
think bugs is up to about 56 years now)  I won't talk too much about this 
<br />
since just about ervybody already has an opinion on these cartoons.
<br />
<br /><br />Well...that's it.  the ABC Saterday morning special is missing from the 
<br />
lineup this year, so I suspect it's finially outlived it's popularity 
<br />
even though it's been on for over 15 years.  some will miss it, other 
<br />
won't.  Other than that, I say that 'Bump in the Night&quot; and &quot;Reboot&quot; are 
<br />
the ONLY good cartoons on ABC this season, and I really think it's sad 
<br />
that Sonic was cancelled to make room for uninteresting, and 'non-fun' 
<br />
show like these new one being introduced.  In fact, this is the FIRST 
<br />
season in my life as long as I can remember that I've been so completely 
<br />
turned off by the lineup available.  Hopefully it'll get better next 
<br />
season and none of this stuff (with those two exceptions) will be renewed.
<br />
<br />Anyway, those are just my thoughts on what the idiots at ABC replaced our 
<br />
favorite Hedgehog with.
<br />
<br />Long live Sonic, and may Madeline and company all get cancelled!!!!
