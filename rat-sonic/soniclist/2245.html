Hello again!
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the past couple of weeks I thought up of a couple of
<br />
ideas (maybe they are even good enough for your FAQ Dan).
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, I have an opinion on Sonic's speed:
<br />
He was born the same as he is now, except for his speed (Blue
<br />
hedgehog with a cool attitude, but with normal speed). Then, one
<br />
day, he came in contact with a very strong power source (This
<br />
happened before he was five, since in &quot;Blast to the Past&quot; he
<br />
already had his speed &lt;Chuck's ring prototype?&gt;). His body got
<br />
filled with energy, and to keep themselves from disintegrating(?),
<br />
his cells had to mutate (there was plenty of energy to do that).
<br />
First of all, the cells reconfigured themselves to be able to take
<br />
in energy at great speed (thus no fatigue from running too fast),
<br />
and they also needed a safe way of getting rid of that energy.
<br />
Giving it off as heat energy would probably burn the body
<br />
(literally), so the next best method it could think of was KINETIC
<br />
ENERGY! (the muscle cells now can expand and contract very quickly,
<br />
thus burn off anergy safely, quickly, and at the same time, kick
<br />
some fat butt). Now the only problem that Sonic has, is that
<br />
&quot;addiction&quot; to chilli dogs, junk food, and any other fatty foods
<br />
that can provide a lot of calories (hey! another explanation!).
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got my copy of the tapes last saturday (thanks Ron), and I
<br />
couldn't find the map that's printed out so clearly in my head (in
<br />
fact, I can recall every detail of the picture). Also I was
<br />
disappointed when in Blast to the Past, I saw that Bunny was not
<br />
robotisized when she was a kid. I also had a &quot;snap-shot&quot; of her
<br />
being robotisized as a kid in my head, and believed 100 percent
<br />
that that was true. I also believe 100 percent that Sally is about
<br />
2 month older that Sonic, but can't find any proof (I feel about
<br />
that about as much as I feel about birds being able to fly). And
<br />
last, I really think that after Doomsday, and Robotnik's thought
<br />
off defeat, Robotnik will come back in about two month (very
<br />
disfigured, but nothing a little plastic surgery can't fix). Am I
<br />
so obsessed with Sonic that my brain attracts information directly
<br />
form Mobius? (sounds like an episode of X-Files) I have no idea.
<br />
The only thing I know is that I just all of a sudden know some part
<br />
of that world, and can't get it out of me.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One more thing. In the episode Heads or Tails (the very badly
<br />
drawn one in comparison to others), Sally Alicia looks exactly like
<br />
the one in the game Sonic Spinball (what was made first, DiC
<br />
episodes, or the game? And what was based on what? And why the heck
<br />
is there Sally &lt;and Bunny, and the rest of the gang&gt; in the game,
<br />
but there is no Knothole, Snively, or anything else we've come to
<br />
admire? And why am I taking up all your valuable time with all
<br />
these questions?)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your time (are you actually still reading?)
<br />

<br />

Here's an interesting quote:

&quot;I am going to overload this sucker!&quot;-Sally, hating the backup

generators for going online, in Sonic Racer.
