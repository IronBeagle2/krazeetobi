<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From: hk512_at_cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Joseph Delacroix)
</em><br />

<br />
I know you asked for replies to you not the list, but hopefully the 
<br />
following will be both relevant and short enough to be OK:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Having read the comments someone made about Gonterman's fanfic, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;specifically the comments made about his anti-anti-CDA stance
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that was contained within it, I am driven to reply to it in a fashion
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;which I reserve exclusively for such inflammatory prose.
</em><br />

<br />
That someone was Chris Forsyth, whom I'll be quoting in a bit...
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sir, do you wish to say that you would take away David's right to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;free expression, just because it *supports* the limitation of said right?  
</em><br />

<br />
I'm sure Chris can speak for himself, but I think you misinterpreted him.
<br />
Here's what he said:
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     What *is* the problem, however, is using what up until then was a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;decent, if somewhat sub-par writing-wise, story as a soapbox to bash a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;group that you politically disagree with. Bashing people you know, like 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;that group of AOLers that you had argued with, is tolerable, but bashing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;an entire group you've had no contact with at all is something else.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     A simple, polite suggestion to you, Mr. Gonterman...please edit that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;story to get rid of the political references, or at the very least, mark 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;it on your site as politically-oriented as you did the other story that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;put forth your views on the CDA and as you keep refering to it, 'smut' on 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;the net. Also, please at least take the time to look up the ACLU site, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;and read the information on just what the CDA is doing, as compared to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;what the media claims it was supposed to do.
</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;     Along with the above, I give a caution to anyone else who might be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;thinking of including politics in their fanfics...please don't. 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Otherwise, the flames will probably become fast and furious. And there a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;lot of people with lower tolerance threshholds than me.
</em><br />

<br />
Here's my short version of what Chris said:
<br />

<br />
If you want to send a message, call Western Union.
<br />

<br />
IMHO, the issue isn't free speech vs. censorship, but rather what's 
<br />
appropriate for fan-fic.  Some people like/don't like TTBS/sex stuff in it, 
<br />
others like/don't like politics, or religion, or violence.  My feeling is 
<br />
that people should be free to write what they want (I'll not get into the 
<br />
copyright/trademark aspect of it), but I suggested a while ago that 
<br />
somebody (preferably the authors) rate the fan-fic in terms of sex and 
<br />
violence so that people like myself who care for neither could skip it.
<br />
Apparently this hasn't happened.
<br />

<br />
You could argue that it's hard to know where to draw the line on these 
<br />
ratings; given the preceding two messages, we should at least add politics 
<br />
to the ratings, and a previous thread (either started or continued by me) 
<br />
implied grimness should be added.  I suppose religion should be added too,
<br />
though it's not usually relevant to most fan-fic, at least Sonic stuff...
<br />

<br />
Just some more rambling,
<br />

<br />
RDB
