<br />
Quozl... I enjoy all sorts of Sonic Stories... even those that don't mesh
<br />
with any sort of 'set sonic universe'.  I'd be interested in seeing that 
<br />
story(s) with Bunny.
<br />

<br />
=======================
<br />
Sonic This -- Sonic #31
<br />
=======================
<br />

<br />
Archie Comic's Sonic #31 was at my local comic shop not long ago.  In the
<br />
main story &quot;A Robot Rides the Rails&quot; we see the return of Geoffery St. 
<br />
John as the freedom fighters battle Robotnik's latest robotic menace.  Two
<br />
other stories include a 2-page teaser for a Knuckles Solo Story (&quot;Lost...
<br />
and Found&quot;).  We also have the start of a solo story featuring ROTOR! 
<br />
Yup!  You heard right.  It's titled &quot;Tundra Road&quot;. 
<br />

<br />
-- Story -- 
<br />
I don't like to spoil stories for people so I'll just say that Sonic
<br />
definitly has some competition when it comes to trying to wind the hand of
<br />
Princess Sally.  Sonic thinks Sally is just trying to get him jealous and
<br />
vows &quot;Two can play at that game!&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Hrmmm..  Maybe he's gonna start going out with Amy Rose (she seems a bit
<br />
young for Sonic though... especially as she was portrayed before).  Bunnie
<br />
doesn't seem like Sonic's type (more like Rotor's type if you ask me). 
<br />
Who's left [Penelope the Platypus from Freedom Fighters: The Next
<br />
Generation (My term for those new guys introduced in the Sally Miniseries)
<br />
(I think that's her name.. I'm doing this from memory [I also have too 
<br />
many nested parentheses... as usual])]
<br />

<br />
-- Art -- 
<br />
Hrm... I can't quite put my finger on what I find 'wrong' with the way the
<br />
main story is drawn (inking, penciling, even coloring?).  Emotions and
<br />
facial expressions don't seem to mesh, the characters at times look too
<br />
stiff, Tails' tails are doing the splits, proportions don't seem right. 
<br />
Sonic is the best-drawn here.  Maybe I'm just being too picky. 
<br />

<br />
The artwork in Rotor's story is the best in this issue.
<br />

<br />
-- Letters and News in Sonic Grams --
<br />
Knuckles Miniseries delayed until April '96 (Spaz and Harvo will be 
<br />
drawing it Mike Kanterovich and Ken Penders will be writing it) but
<br />
Knuckles Solo stories will continue in 'Sonic' proper.  The story in
<br />
#34 will lead to his own mini-series.
<br />

<br />
Super Sonic vs. Hyper Knuckles 48-Page Special... No news other than it
<br />
is being worked on.
<br />

<br />
In the letters, Peter Draper asks how Dylan's name is pronounced 
<br />
[ It's apparently &quot;DILL-an&quot; ].
<br />
&nbsp;
<br />
I still want to know if Dylan is a hedgehog or a porcupine
<br />
(and if he's a hedgehog (which he kinda looks more like) why does he look
<br />
so different from Sonic, Amy Rose, and Uncle Chuck?). 
<br />

<br />
Peter also asks if the voice Knuckle's hears in &quot;First Contact&quot; is his 
<br />
dad's.  [ 'Close' but apparently not ]
<br />

<br />
By the way... Anyone on this list ever get a letter published in 
<br />
Sonic-Grams?
<br />

<br />
========================
<br />
Sonic That -- Sonic Book
<br />
========================
<br />

<br />
I saw a new Sonic book.  Arrg.. I forget the author and publisher but it
<br />
is one of those kids books with the buttons along the side which make 
<br />
assorted annoying noises.  I noticed the Sally button has her laughing.
<br />

<br />
====================================
<br />
Sonic The Other Thing -- Sonic Games
<br />
====================================
<br />

<br />
Yes, I know this list isn't about the games but at least I waited until I
<br />
had something else to say as well...  I also put this section last in 
<br />
case people got bored with the rest of my letter and hit the 'Next' button)
<br />

<br />
I just noticed that the Game Gear has about 5 Sonic-Based titles
<br />
(including a new Tails game) which the Genesis (known as the Mega System
<br />
outside the USA... so I'm told) doesn't have.  Whaaa!  I can't afford a
<br />
Game Gear (and at this point, something better will probably come out
<br />
soon).  The Sonic Labarynth one looks interesting though. 
<br />

<br />
Also... Not long ago I drew up sphere-for-sphere maps of all fourteen
<br />
'run-around-the-globe-getting-blue-spheres' bonus levels found in Sonic 3
<br />
and Sonic &amp; Knuckles (lotta pausing, lotta patience, lotta colored dots on
<br />
graph paper)...  If there's any interest I might draw em up on a computer
<br />
and makes GIFs or PNGs out of them.  
<br />

<br />
Jeez!  &quot;Mega System&quot;?  What a horrid name.
<br />

<br />
