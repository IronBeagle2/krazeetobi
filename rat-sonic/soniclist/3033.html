You said:

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;From: hk512_at_cleveland.Freenet.Edu (Joseph Delacroix)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I know you asked for replies to you not the list, but hopefully the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;following will be both relevant and short enough to be OK:
</em><br />

<br />
Well, the only reason I said to send it to me was because I fear
<br />
the wrath of Ratman.  Otherwise, I'd go ahead and send everything to
<br />
the list I damn well pleased.  =)  However, I think replying
<br />
directly to the list this time won't bother anyone, either.  If 
<br />
anyone does mind, however, make your voice known, and I'll reply directly
<br />
to everyone from now on.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Sir, do you wish to say that you would take away David's right to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;free expression, just because it *supports* the limitation of said right?  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I'm sure Chris can speak for himself, but I think you misinterpreted him.
</em><br />

<br />
I might have over-reacted a tad, but I believe that my interpetation
<br />
of the point that he was sending to me was valid.  (See below)
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's what he said:
</em><br />

<br />
[deletae]
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's my short version of what Chris said:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;If you want to send a message, call Western Union.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;IMHO, the issue isn't free speech vs. censorship, but rather what's 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;appropriate for fan-fic.  Some people like/don't like TTBS/sex stuff in it, 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;others like/don't like politics, or religion, or violence.  My feeling is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;that people should be free to write what they want (I'll not get into the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;copyright/trademark aspect of it), but I suggested a while ago that 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;somebody (preferably the authors) rate the fan-fic in terms of sex and 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;violence so that people like myself who care for neither could skip it.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Apparently this hasn't happened.
</em><br />

<br />
Well, that's a pretty challenging thing to do, considering that
<br />
everyone's view of certain factors is different.  It's hard to
<br />
find impartial people to do that sort of thing.  (Besides, it's a
<br />
pain in the rear to do!  =)
<br />

<br />
However, in my eyes, the issue is not only `what's appropriate for
<br />
fanfic' but also `what's appropriate, period'.  Of course, I have,
<br />
of late, bcome rather annoyed with people who SAY they back the
<br />
anti-CDA movement, but at the same time try to censor something
<br />
THEY don't like.  THAT's what irks me, and THAT is what I responded
<br />
to.  The other things just happened to follow along as supporting
<br />
elements...man, I must have said those words a thousand times to
<br />
a thousand people over the last few months.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;You could argue that it's hard to know where to draw the line on these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;ratings; given the preceding two messages, we should at least add politics 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to the ratings, and a previous thread (either started or continued by me) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;implied grimness should be added.  I suppose religion should be added too,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;though it's not usually relevant to most fan-fic, at least Sonic stuff...
</em><br />

<br />
Well, to tell the truth `rating' literature has always been
<br />
something of a heartburn-inducing thing with me.  I don't like
<br />
the idea of a book (or a story) being judged by others to be
<br />
&quot;bad&quot; or &quot;good&quot; because of X amount of sex or X amount of politics
<br />
in it.  I know that wasn't your intent, but that's how people seem to
<br />
judge the ratings in movies sometimes.
<br />

<br />
But hey, I'm not saying *I'm* right.  I just happen to have a strong
<br />
dislike of rating things because of X variable...I believe that the
<br />
content of a story, not a property of it, determines its value.
<br />
Of course, the film industry's been using it for ages now.  Maybe I'm
<br />
just old-fashioned.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just some more rambling,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;RDB
</em><br />

<br />
Joe.
