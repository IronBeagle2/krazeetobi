<br />
A predator must be swift and agile...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three minutes later, David compiled all the information
<br />
he could find regarding faster-than-light travel.  According to
<br />
the library data, the theoretical and practical principles had
<br />
been under extensive study for a period of twenty years.  During
<br />
the Great War, the world's prime physicists performed extensive
<br />
research on the prospect of FTL propulsion.  The work was funded
<br />
by many of the governments on Mobius, in the hopes that some
<br />
people would survive by leaving the planet for a new home if
<br />
Mobius was destroyed.  The day never came, but the research
<br />
continued on for two years after the war had ceased.  After that
<br />
time, the research had been terminated.  No specification of the
<br />
reason, but David knew the answer.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The basic aspects of a FTL apparatus (informally dubbed &quot;warp
<br />
drive&quot;) had many advantages to it.  It allowed a ship to travel
<br />
faster than c;  while preventing the total, simultaneous
<br />
consumption of the two selected power reactants:  matter and
<br />
antimatter.  The premise involved controlled alternations in
<br />
phase between &quot;realspace&quot; and &quot;warpspace&quot; for no longer than a
<br />
very short span in time, insuring that the ship would never be
<br />
at c.  If the ship did come to the speed of light under a warp
<br />
field, the ship would create a space/time distortion, appearing
<br />
in all points in the universe.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Countless systems were involved to insure that the ship would
<br />
operate without endangering itself and its crew.  An integrated
<br />
computer controlled many of the ship's functions, either
<br />
autonomously or with crew assistance on the critical systems.
<br />
Navigational deflectors protected the ship from lethal
<br />
interstellar particle drag, both in sublight and warp space.
<br />
Low-level shielding safeguarded the crew and delicate hardware
<br />
from the radiation in space.  These and many other aspects made
<br />
the ship like a living organism.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were severe flaws in the technology that David wished to
<br />
emulate.  For one, warp engine engagement inside a significant
<br />
gravity field was detrimental to both the ship and the object.
<br />
If a ship did so in the gravity environment of a planet, the
<br />
planet and ship would be destroyed.  Another problem involved
<br />
the sheer volume of the drive mechanism itself.  Unless David
<br />
dramatically grew to a gargantuan size, utilization of such a
<br />
propulsive device would be impossible for him to personally
<br />
implement.  In short, he needed another method based on the
<br />
interstellar warp drive, something that would produce a similar
<br />
result but would be safe and of the right volume.  Then the
<br />
gravity of the situation dawned on him.  Literally.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David started the physics program in the computer, then entered
<br />
complex equations as he double- and triple-checked them in his
<br />
cognitive center, contemplating the use of the gravity field
<br />
generated by a planet to provide both the warp reactants and
<br />
permit secure FTL travel without creating unnecessary danger to
<br />
himself and Mobius.  Five seconds later, the proposed warp drive
<br />
plus the necessary protection hardware and power feeds came
<br />
together on the video display.  He revised and recalculated the
<br />
basic design for another fifteen seconds, allowing for the
<br />
interaction of his body motion and its effect on the warp field.
<br />
&nbsp;The end result:  a dynamic geometry graviton warp drive.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Satisfied with the product, David downloaded the required
<br />
information via his optical sensors to his growth protocol
<br />
circuitry.  He and his relative both viewed the visible
<br />
alterations that David made on his body.  The task began first
<br />
inside his tails.  They deflated in volume about 20%, regaining
<br />
their original size, as the millions of interconnected computers
<br />
in his compuorganic brain calculated and recalculated the final
<br />
required mass/volume ratio for the warp nacelles and his organic
<br />
muscles.  Two blue slits formed on each tail, running parallel
<br />
to the tail's axis, for about 75% of each tail's length.  The
<br />
tails retained their flexibility, while acting as rotors and
<br />
warp nacelles, effectively designating (by design) the tails as
<br />
rotor/nacelles.  After the external modifications, David grew
<br />
the internal warp drive and power feeds to the rest of his body,
<br />
plus an antigraviton generator (for the warp drive reaction
<br />
chamber and navigational deflector).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beside the tail bases, David added two vent slits for his
<br />
impulse drive.  This would allow him to maintain the ability to
<br />
utilize realspace velocities up to c, should the situation
<br />
permit or require him to do so.  He then followed up with the
<br />
internal construction of six micrograviton generators (non-warp
<br />
propulsive), to provide power, realspace travel, and graviton
<br />
generation for uses other than propulsion (in the event that
<br />
another of his upgrades would require it).
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his chest area, David reallocated space to his organic and
<br />
sensor components to allow space for the navigational deflector.
<br />
&nbsp;It lay under his skin, unexposed compared to the external
<br />
evidence of the impulse vents and warp nacelle slits.
<br />
Microvents formed around the navigational deflector emitter,
<br />
permitting unhindered access for gravitons to the G/AG warp
<br />
reaction chamber.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uh, David,&quot; Tails inquired, &quot;you're not going out like that,
<br />
are you?&quot;  He indicated the exposed areas on his tails and
<br />
posterior.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No, I'm not about to,&quot; he replied to his vulpine familiar.
<br />
&quot;This is merely for the time when the warp or impulse drives
<br />
will be in use.  They will be concealed when they are not.&quot;  As
<br />
if to prove the point, flaps of protective metal shell covered
<br />
with organic overlay veiled the evidence.  &quot;Now for the
<br />
evaluation phase.  I believe that the Great Plains will be
<br />
sufficient for the experiment.&quot;
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After surveying the Great Plains near the Great Forest, David
<br />
found a treeless area which would allow him to engage his warp
<br />
drive without the risk of destroying foliage.  Motioning to
<br />
Tails to maintain a discreet distance, he began the warp
<br />
engagement procedure.  Setting his tails parallel to the ground
<br />
and bracing himself for the dramatic change in velocity, he felt
<br />
the differential graviton field increase in strength...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And displace him from the ground.  'Very well, then,' he
<br />
thought to himself, 'I will have to engage the warp drive while
<br />
in flight.'  He calculated what the final radius of the warp
<br />
field would be so that he could format a baseline for minimum
<br />
height above ground.  The projected result was two meters, so
<br />
for safety purposes, he preset the minimum height for 2.5 m and
<br />
engaged the NOE (Nap of the Earth) dynamic subroutine.  While he
<br />
was correcting his required delta-h from the ground, he
<br />
monitored the audio level generated from his nacelles.  'They
<br />
are at 90% of maximum power for warp one insertion, so the
<br />
maximum level should be thirty decibels,' he considered.
<br />
Excellent, since that indicated that the noise reduction
<br />
programs responsible for reshaping the graviton warp field were
<br />
performing perfectly.  With a five decibel increase from the
<br />
transition from realspace into warp, that meant the total
<br />
emitted detectable audio would be 35 dB.  One flash of blue
<br />
light from the nacelles, and he was somewhere else.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He circled Mobius 15,000 times in less than a second, and then
<br />
returned to his position of origin.  &quot;Tails,&quot; he called to his
<br />
brother, &quot;how audible was that?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I couldn't really hear it,&quot; he answered.  &quot;It was almost like
<br />
you didn't use it.  I could barely hear the blast right before
<br />
you took off.&quot;  He had confirmed David's analysis of the noise
<br />
reduction software.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Fantastic.  Now for the other experiments.  On to weapons
<br />
control.&quot;
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
...must be able to strike hard...
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On a granite rock, located on the cliff surrounding much of
<br />
Knothole, were a set of twenty peaceful tin cans.  With target
<br />
markers painted on them.  A beam of intensely focused energy
<br />
flashed to each can, striking in the center of each target
<br />
marker.  The violated metal vaporized and sheared, each can was
<br />
forced to the ground by the persuasion of the energy beam.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All right, David!&quot; Tails exclaimed after the carnage had taken
<br />
its course on the entire target set.  &quot;You hit them perfectly.
<br />
It works!&quot;  Looking toward David quizzically, he inquired, &quot;What
<br />
exactly is it?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This,&quot; David returned, indicating the finger responsible for
<br />
the outburst of radiation, &quot;is a phaser emitter.  And what you
<br />
saw impact those tin cans was phaser energy.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Isn't that like a laser?&quot; his brother wondered.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Somewhat similar,&quot; the other responded, &quot;but much more
<br />
powerful than a laser.  Barring the complex technical terms,
<br />
what makes a phaser different from a laser, is that a phaser
<br />
undergoes a phase transition before it is emitted from a source;
<br />
unlike a laser, which is merely generated and fired.  The phase
<br />
alteration creates a much more energetic energy beam than a
<br />
laser of identical power.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A noise came from Tails' abdomen.  &quot;Ooops, excuse me.  I guess
<br />
I'm kinda hungry.&quot;  Looking at his watch, the time was 1230
<br />
hours.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I would tend to agree with you, Tails,&quot; David consented.  &quot;I
<br />
could conceivably continue without further food intake until
<br />
approximately 2200 hours;  however, since my new organic and
<br />
computer systems are still attempting to adapt to the new
<br />
components and energy demands, I could stand to consume
<br />
something significant.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vulpines flew off toward Knothole and nourishment, after
<br />
bagging the now-mutilated cans and locating the recycling
<br />
container for tin.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
...but most of all, must never underestimate the prey.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David experimented with the graviton focusing software (for
<br />
non-propulsive events), attempting to find a use for the reserve
<br />
energy he had in the micrograviton generators.  As he paced by
<br />
the cliff by himself, a twenty-ton sandstone slab somehow
<br />
separated from the rest of its bed.  David saw the steadily
<br />
increasing darkness surrounding him, looked up to view the rock
<br />
which was accelerating from the gravity pull...
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was deflected away from him about two meters above,
<br />
causing a momentary flash of Cerenkov radiation as the induced
<br />
spatial distortion difference between the shield and the rock
<br />
dissipated.  Belatedly pondering the significance of utilizing a
<br />
graviton repulsor-based shield, he added the permanent emitter
<br />
components for dispersing the graviton field.  Without it, he
<br />
would have most certainly at least been severely injured, if not
<br />
perpetually deactivated.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, David thought of how to utilize the excess metal from
<br />
the reconstruction in his skeletal frame.  His thoughts traveled
<br />
back to something he saw earlier in the day, something regarding
<br />
a particular fish that used part of its endoskeleton to defend
<br />
itself.  He tried diffusing the excess metal into his skin and
<br />
hair.  Twenty seconds later, a perfected subroutine for armor
<br />
had been written.  David was prepared to defend himself as well
<br />
as attack.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back in their hut at 2300 hours, David and Tails found
<br />
themselves depleted, but satisfied from the past day.  Today had
<br />
turned out to be a very productive one for David, and his
<br />
brother and comrade was pleased to see that David had taken a
<br />
turn for the better.  Not too long ago, the black and gray
<br />
vulpine was depressed, due to the system hardware/software
<br />
failures that he had little or no control over.  Now, he was in
<br />
control of an innovative body that he designed, with the added
<br />
security that he could continue to add new components to it.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Boy,&quot; Tails said, yawning, &quot;it's really been a long day.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, that it has,&quot; his significant other concurred.  &quot;Before I
<br />
forget, I need to reinitialize my integrated system, to allow my
<br />
DNA to have the required data to repair or replace the
<br />
components should the requirement arise.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;OK, David,&quot; his red companion responded, &quot;I'll close my eyes
<br />
for this, since I'm about ready to drop dead anyway,&quot; he said,
<br />
chuckling.  He climbed up into his bed, covered himself, and
<br />
positioned himself away from David.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David then exploded in a flash of light, permeating some of the
<br />
darkness outside, and then returned to his default luminosity as
<br />
the DNA restructured and configured itself.  With a sudden wave
<br />
of dizziness, he fell into his bed, knowing that there would be
<br />
many more projects to attend to.  As for now, they would have to
<br />
be done...tomorrow.
