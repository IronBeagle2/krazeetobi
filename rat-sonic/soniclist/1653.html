Okay, here my attempt at a Sonic story.. If you feel like flaming me.. go=
<br />
&nbsp;ahead!
<br />
I like to set my moron-mailer onto some poor &lt;FEMALE_DOG&gt;'s address.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Hiya all! Another Sonic story!  [JOY!] Though I would like to say that from
<br />
my point of view this story moves too quickly... but.. maybe you will enjoy
<br />
it.
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________=

<br />
If you want to swap mindless information, send me hate mail, give me Sonic's
<br />
DNA strings (Or even yours?) Email me at: ablater_at_lin01.global.co.za
<br />

<br />
Please note: I actually *RESPOND* to mail, unlike *some* people..
<br />
[In other words I'm pleading for feed back]
<br />
____________________________________________________________________________=
<br />
___
<br />
This story was designed with the least possible added characters,
<br />
[Oh sure, it has Bookshire or Packbell], but unlike some stories I've
<br />
seen, it doesn't:
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Alter the storyline from there on.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Add characters that represent the writer. [Becoming hero's of=
<br />
&nbsp;course!]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Forget about Sonic and focus on some other hero. [Who steals the=
<br />
&nbsp;show]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Have any mega-depressing parts. [That force me to meditate!]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Have any ninja's.  [PHEWW!]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#) Exceed 80 Chars on the X-axis. [Ahahahha!]
<br />

<br />
Though personally I prefer my &quot;RL10-Tortured Freedom&quot; Story to this.
<br />

<br />
But...
<br />

<br />
Onward:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Cold Deceptions&quot; By Simon Howes
<br />

<br />
Robotnik grinned evily as he saw the blue blaze on his monitor heading for
<br />
the factory, yes, the hedgehog was right on time. It seemed to him
<br />
that the freedom fighters never missed a chance to strike, and today it=
<br />
&nbsp;would
<br />
be to his advantage.
<br />

<br />
A week previously a freedom fighter doomed for the robotocizer had=
<br />
&nbsp;heroically
<br />
escaped, and in his departure taken a CD containing important information
<br />
concerning the plastic factory.
<br />
At the time the overlord had nearly exploded with rage, but just before he
<br />
could reach his critical point, his android had stopped him with some more
<br />
of his digital ingenius.
<br />

<br />
As a result of this, the factory had now been reconfigured, and though from
<br />
the outside it could still be seen spewing out smoke like it always had,
<br />
on the inside there were some drastic modifications in production. For one
<br />
thing, the casting machines had been replaced with squadrons of swat-bots,
<br />
the security had taken a swing for the increase. There were at least a
<br />
hundred and fifty laser turrets, and to crown it all, the central fluid
<br />
conduit--the weakest area, the area where a single charge of explosive could
<br />
take the whole factory up from, had been removed and replaced with a
<br />
welcoming team.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Princess Sally looked nervously at her communicator, waiting for a reply
<br />
from Sonic. Time seemed to drag on eternally, until finally it popped with
<br />
Sonic's voice.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Okay Sal, I'm there, nothing seems to be hapnin', I'm going in!&quot;
<br />
She paused for a moment, &quot;Okay, but be carefull!&quot;
<br />

<br />
With that the connection seized, and she was left alone again, lost in the
<br />
evening-light of a former capitol city. Light that once would have been
<br />
safe to walk in, light that was now dominated by cold-metallic-evil and
<br />
enslaved-former-organics.
<br />

<br />
She found herself staring into the heart of the city where the factory was,
<br />
past the broken and war-torn buildings, past the dumps of a former garden
<br />
city. Her soul cried out wanting to be with him, voices inside her told her
<br />
that something wasn't right.
<br />
She hesitated, in the sky she could see a hover-unit heading for the=
<br />
&nbsp;factory.
<br />
&quot;Sonic!&quot; she screamed over the radio, &quot;it's a trap, get out of there!&quot;
<br />

<br />
She never heard his reply, as a cold-robotic hand savagely hoisted her up=
<br />
&nbsp;from
<br />
behind. In the process her communicator fell to the ground and crumbled as
<br />
the robot stepped on it.
<br />

<br />
The machine carried her for a few blocks before coming to a hover unit, it
<br />
then stood idly in front of a swat-bot for about half a minute, seemingly
<br />
transferring data or awaiting orders.
<br />
Eventually the unit reacted, fetching a restrainer out of the hover-unit
<br />
and latching it over her--pinning her arms firmly to her side. The swat-bot
<br />
then took custody of her and headed the hover-unit for the Robotropolis
<br />
command centre.
<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------=
<br />
-
<br />

<br />
Inside, another swat-bot took her up to Robotnik's control room, the droid
<br />
stopped at the doorway, giving her a moment to witness Robotniks fury.
<br />

<br />
He continued on, apparently not aware of her presence, yelling, slamming his
<br />
hands on control panels, screaming curses on hedgehogs. Tried to pull his
<br />
hair, but found out that he didn't have any.
<br />
&quot;Damn you hedgehog! Damn YOU!! One day you will be mine! You and all your
<br />
little friends! One day! ONE DAY!   ONE DAAAYY!!&quot;
<br />
With that he swung around ready to strike the nearest thing, when an image
<br />
terminated his task in mid-action.
<br />

<br />
His facial expressions morphed from those of despair, anguish, frustration
<br />
and anger to an alarming grin.
<br />
&quot;Well.. well..&quot; he clasped his hands together, &quot;what have we here?&quot;
<br />
The princess struggled.
<br />
He smiled even more, &quot;there is no need to resist, you cannot escape..&quot;
<br />
&quot;You'll never get away with this!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell came to the door that moment, and shared in his makers amusement,
<br />
and added to the chat. &quot;So is that where they get the expression from?&quot;
<br />
Again Robotnik chuckled, then pointing to the restrainer with a motion,
<br />
the swat-bot handed her to Packbell, who removed the device and continued
<br />
to hold her firmly.
<br />
With another motion, the swat-bots left the room. The door hissed shut.
<br />

<br />
The overlord faced away, paced the room for a moment, then came back to face
<br />
the princess up close.
<br />
&quot;If there was one wish that I could have, I would wish I could let you and
<br />
your friends all see each other suffer.. but.. however.. it seems that,
<br />
you alone will have to do for now...&quot;
<br />
He grinned evily immersing Sally in bad breath, masquerading the versatility
<br />
of the 'Mobian-common-cold' to polymorph across species.
<br />

<br />
Packbell headed for the door, it would be good to robotocize this trouble
<br />
maker and get her out of the way for good he thought to himself.
<br />
A digital flicker from what manifested as his sub-concious mind stopped him
<br />
in his tracks. He turned to face Ivo, satisfaction in his voice, &quot;perhaps
<br />
there is a way.. perhaps there is..&quot;
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Robotnik stared confused.
<br />
&quot;Perhaps before we robotocize this..&quot; he lifted the squirrel slightly, &quot;I
<br />
could have a private word with you..&quot;

<br />
Sonic arrived back at Knothole, to have his frantic questions answered by
<br />
even more frantic questions.
<br />
No one had seen her!
<br />

<br />
He quivered, they had her! They HAD HER! THEY HAD HER!
<br />

<br />
All at once he found himself racing forward towards Robotropolis, but in
<br />
his state of being governed by anger and fear, and loss of energy from
<br />
his escape, bad perception resulted in him colliding into a tree not
<br />
meters away from Bunny.
<br />

<br />
When she got to him, he was out cold.

<br />
Princess Sally's heart went static as the glass cylinder closed over her,
<br />
shielding Robotnik from her comments, locking her in with her thoughts. This
<br />
was the end she thought to herself between the humming pulses of the
<br />
machine, she felt faint..
<br />

<br />
Outside a swat-bot held a camera, catching every moment of
<br />
Robotniks glory. Ivo spoke to the camera for a long time, pointing to her,
<br />
pointing at the machinery, the cylinder, and then finally clutching his
<br />
Robotic arm.
<br />

<br />
Packbell pressed a button; the humming inside the glass cylinder siezed;
<br />
was replaced by a yellow beam engulfing the young princess's vision.
<br />
All at once a thousand thoughts overflowed her mind, fear, pain, struggling,
<br />
futility and chaos. A cold chill ran down her spine, her head felt mildy=
<br />
&nbsp;warm.
<br />

<br />
The chaos caused her to become intolerably dizzy.
<br />
She fell towards the floor, striking her head on the glass side as she went.
<br />
Everything began to fade.
<br />

<br />
In the next few moments of percepted twilight the beam stopped; the glass
<br />
raised; and Robotnik loomed over her laughing.
<br />

<br />
Laughing that resonated in her mind as she passed into the dark world.

<br />

<br />
Large tears ran down Sonic's face as he looked out to the sunrise, Bookshire
<br />
tried the best he could to comfort his friend, but failed to succeed, even
<br />
he could feel the pain, the loss. Princess Sally always did the comforting,
<br />
and now, she.. she was gone. The only thing left was her memory, he could
<br />
see her now, sitting on the wall they were on, comforting him about the
<br />
loss of Sidney.
<br />

<br />
The pain inside him boiled, but no tears ever rolled down his face. He took
<br />
a deep breath, causing his lungs to tingle. &quot;Sonic, there is nothing you
<br />
could have done.. she .. was a fighter.. till the end.. she .. warned..&quot;
<br />
He stopped just as his voice began to waver; dropped his eyes to the
<br />
green foliage below.
<br />

<br />
Suddenly Bunny came running up towards them, holding something shiny in her
<br />
hand. &quot;Books!&quot; she yelled as she came close enough for him to realise that
<br />
it was a CD, &quot;ah rohbot gayve this to muh, sayd we should vyuu it...&quot;
<br />
With that the three energetically headed to his hut, where he slid the shiny
<br />
mysterious disk into his computer.
<br />

<br />
He scanned it, there was a single file on it.
<br />
&nbsp;&lt;WITHLOVE.SVF&gt; 635Mb
<br />
&quot;A stereo-video file&quot; he thought to himself, &quot;..holographic video&quot;,
<br />
he plugged a silvery plate to his computer.
<br />

<br />
He looked back at them, they had been joined by Antoine, Rotor and Tails.
<br />
He squeezed a smile, &quot;Okay, here it is..&quot;
<br />
He loaded Autotech Play and selected the file.
<br />

<br />
An image formed between the two plates, it was Robotnik.
<br />
He smiled, &quot;Hello my dear freedom fighters, this is my first home-video
<br />
release, so I intend to make it a good one. I call this movie 'Victory'.&quot;
<br />
The camera panned out, showing Sally in the Robotocizer.
<br />

<br />
There was a chord of worry from the band.
<br />

<br />
&quot;You see&quot; he pointed at the bulky machine, &quot;this is a robotocizer, it
<br />
optimizes flesh. That over there is our experienced operator, Mr Packbell.
<br />
He makes sure that your process is as efficient as possible.&quot;
<br />
He clutched his robotocized arm, &quot;you hedgehog have already given me a
<br />
demonstration of it, now it is my turn!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell pressed the switch.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Aunt Sally?&quot; Bunnie grabbed Tails, hugging him tightly; Rotor made sickly
<br />
noises and left the room; Antoine fainted; Bookshire looked down;
<br />
Sonic just stared on, hypnotized.
<br />

<br />
He saw her flesh turning to metal, her eyes filled with fear--turning red,
<br />
he choked, sorrow collapsing his heart. Before the conversion was complete
<br />
however, the video cut to another scene.
<br />

<br />
It was the new-Sally, coldly killing freedom fighters with a laser rifle.
<br />
One after another she shot them down, even a cub, with no hesitation for
<br />
emotions. Tails made a whimpering noise as Bunnie lifted him away, cradling
<br />
the crying fox him in her arms.
<br />

<br />
Bookshire never saw the end of the clip, as Sonic aggresively drove his fist
<br />
through the holographic projector. Normally the raccoon would have been
<br />
angry, but in this instance he felt slightly relieved that he'd been saved
<br />
from enduring the rest of Robotnik's poison.
<br />

<br />
Sonic ran out of the room, Bookshire staggered behind him.
<br />
&quot;Where are you going?&quot;
<br />
&quot;To Robotropolis!&quot;
<br />
Bookshire was shocked, &quot;It's too late! Don't Sonic, please! DON'T!&quot;
<br />
But he was already gone.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
The first thing Princess Sally did after she opened her eyes was to try and
<br />
raise her hand into her immediate field of vision. Something however
<br />
stopped her, so instead she rotated her head.
<br />

<br />
What she saw scared her more than she had expected, for her hand was NOT
<br />
robotic! Nor were her arms. She tried to sit up to see the rest of her body
<br />
but something stopped her. It took a few moments of reasoning for her to
<br />
realise that she was strapped to a.. a.. bed?
<br />

<br />
There was a laugh from somewhere out of her vision, a laugh like the one she
<br />
heard before she was ..&lt;robotocized?&gt; Robotnik lurked over her, grinning
<br />
evily. &quot;My dear princess, about now you are wondering what I did to you?&quot;
<br />
Sally didn't say anything, she DIDN'T want to know.
<br />

<br />
Robotnik called to his nephew, there was a short reply, and then a hovering
<br />
screen drifted over to above her. On it it was a still image of her in
<br />
the glass cylinder. The overlord laughed, &quot;thanks to technology designed
<br />
a few hundred years ago, we are able to bring you, in full 3d, your *own*
<br />
robotocization!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The video started up, showing the beam engulfing and changing her. She
<br />
looked at her hand again for reassurance.. As a result of this, Robotnik
<br />
burst into long uncontrollable laughs, then shouting to his nephew
<br />
again the video stopped and the image returned to the still of her before
<br />
the process.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Now, my dear princess, watch carefully!&quot;
<br />
The video started again, this time however, the beam just glowed around her,
<br />
yet did nothing. At the end she was treated to the sight of herself=
<br />
&nbsp;fainting.
<br />

<br />
Ivo spoke evily, &quot;Video Raster SE100, by Creative Fabs and Autotech
<br />
Reanimator, and you're ready to make your own videos!&quot;
<br />
&quot;You'll never get away with this!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Don't tell me you don't like it, it took my assistant three hours to edit
<br />
all the frames! You know, little critics like you get robotocized, but,
<br />
that comes later.. right now, I'd like you to watch my next release.&quot;
<br />

<br />
The screen went blank for a moment, until finally another video came on,
<br />
it was her! And in the video she was killing freedom fighters left, right
<br />
and centre. Then finally it came to a part where she waved at the camera,
<br />
&quot;Hello Sally my dear princess, I'd like you to appreciate the phong
<br />
rendering capabilities of 4D Studio from Autotech. You see, what we do,
<br />
is digitise a mesh of you, import you, and we are ready to go..&quot;
<br />
Sally opened her mouth in awe, the voice seemed similar enough to how she
<br />
heard it when it was played back to her from NICOLE's DA/AD converters.
<br />

<br />
Robotnik laughed, &quot;now, after you've finished admiring yourself, there is
<br />
something just.. wonderfull.. that I'd like you to see.&quot;
<br />
&quot;I don't want to see it!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Good, I like it when people resist!&quot;
<br />
With that Packbell appeared out of thin-air, undid the straps and held her
<br />
so she could get a view of the ground.
<br />

<br />
Robotnik held a small box, then pushing some switches on it, a hologram of
<br />
her appeared.. though unlike normal holograms, this one was far more stable.
<br />
In fact, it looked exactly like her. Across the room Snively had several
<br />
devices of VR gear strapped to him, he danced around--the Sally hologram did
<br />
the same... he spoke, and in Sally's voice the hologram seemed to do the
<br />
same.
<br />

<br />
The android lifted her over to Robotniks face, he smiled, &quot;You see, with
<br />
four speakers, we can get perfect directional sound. Now, what you are
<br />
probably wondering.. is what am *I* going to do now?&quot;
<br />
Sally didn't reply, so Ivo continued.
<br />
&quot;The home-video you watched just now was posted to your friends, all of it
<br />
except that very personal greeting message though.. well.. now all your..&quot;
<br />
&quot;HOW DARE YOU!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Packbell clamped his hand over her mouth, and Robotnik continued.
<br />
&quot;All your friends have got upset, right now, the only thing on their little
<br />
minds is your avengence.. And when they try, they will be amazed to
<br />
see you are still a .. fox.. squirrel.. whatever you are.. only you'll be
<br />
on *MY* side!&quot; he motioned the holographic projector.
<br />

<br />
&quot;MMMPFFGHHHAAA!!&quot;
<br />
Robotnik smiled, &quot;Packbell my boy, let our friend have her beauty sleep..&quot;=
<br />

<br />
With that the android rapidly changed his grip, causing the princess to
<br />
pass out.
<br />

<br />

<br />
Sonic charged into the heart of Robotropolis, searching for something to
<br />
destroy, frantically tracking for a target, like a predator. Anger ruled in
<br />
him now, and for vengeance he would die--he didn't want to live anymore
<br />
anyway...
<br />

<br />
He headed for Robotnik's control structure, at his top speed, 350Kph, all
<br />
he could do without a power-ring. Suddenly he stopped--something caught
<br />
his eye.
<br />

<br />
Was his mind playing tricks on him? He looked again, Sally was standing
<br />
in front of the door. &quot;Sal?&quot; he asked stunned.
<br />
&quot;Sonic&quot; she whined, &quot;please leave, if I move they're going to drop a ton
<br />
of bricks on me from up there!&quot;
<br />
The hedgehog hesitated, there was something in her voice that he was not
<br />
familiar with, it wasn't fear... her voice seemed oddly calm and collected,
<br />
as if though she had accepted her fate.
<br />

<br />
He looked to the top of the building, a brick would take at least fifteen
<br />
seconds to fall that high. He looked at her again, &quot;Sal? Are you okay?&quot;
<br />
Her eyes seemed to stare through him, then she began, &quot;It's the side effects
<br />
of the de-robotocizer, it seems to give an odd feeling of euphoria, while
<br />
the body is left disorientated for a short duration...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic looked at her strangely, she was right, he'd never heard her talk like
<br />
that before, it was almost robotic--which could have been a side-effect.
<br />
He looked to the top of the building again, &quot;Okay Sal, I'm going to grab=
<br />
&nbsp;ya..
<br />
are ya ready?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Certainly Sonic.. Am I not always ready?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Uuuh sure..Sal Okay?&quot;
<br />

<br />
He raced forward, grabbing her hand, but something odd happened, his hand
<br />
went straight through hers. He tried again--the same result.
<br />
&quot;Wait just a Sonic sec..&quot; he began, when abruptly two probes burried
<br />
themselves in his skin. Just as he noticed the wires to them, a high voltage
<br />
seared through him, knocking him out cold.
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
When he awakened he was in a glass cylinder, outside Robotnik was filming
<br />
his next home-video. After a lot more mumbling, Packbell threw a switch,
<br />
Sonic was immersed in yellow light.
<br />

<br />
He just stood there, waiting for the worst, but nothing happened. The
<br />
cylinder raised, and after he surveyed his body, he smiled, &quot;Our special
<br />
guest star for today.. Sonic the HEDGEHOG!&quot;
<br />

<br />
But Robotnik didn't seem bothered that his machine hadn't had the desired
<br />
results, instead he just smiled. &quot;If I was going to robotocize you, don't
<br />
you think I would have succeeded at it?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Then what..?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Robotnik smiled, &quot;Well, you see, I just did something better..&quot; He pressed
<br />
a button on a remote and the hover-screen began displaying a picture of
<br />
Sally. She was rolling around on the floor in agony, &quot;No please don't make
<br />
me fade! PLEASE! PLEASE! NOOOO!&quot; With that she lost her opacity.
<br />

<br />
Robotnik chuckled, &quot;I can see right through her now! And soon you too will
<br />
fade completely from existance!&quot;
<br />
Sonic was puzzled,&quot;But why would she lead me into a trap?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Because&quot; grinned Robotnik, &quot;I offered her a trade, her existance for=
<br />
&nbsp;yours!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic was bewildered, but in a moment of gripping the situation, he had
<br />
gripped something else -- Robotniks throat. Tilting his body
<br />
horizontally, he pressed his splines up against the overlords exposed neck.
<br />

<br />
Ivo choked, &quot;Packbell!&quot; The android just stood at a distance however, &quot;I do
<br />
not have sufficient time to reach you from here.&quot;
<br />
Something body temprature
<br />
began rolling down the human's neck, he frantically tried to plan an escape.
<br />
&quot;Wait rodent, if you kill me, you can say goodbye to your girlfriend!&quot;
<br />
Sonic smoothly replied, &quot;too bad, I don't like her anymore!&quot;
<br />
Robotnik wheezed, &quot;wait.. I .. lied, it was just a trick.. PACKBELL, bring
<br />
the princess.. QUICK!&quot;
<br />
Sonic squeezed a bit tighter, enlarging the wound.
<br />
&quot;Now..just..relax..hedgehog....just..relax.. That..image..you..saw..of..
<br />
her..was..just..a..hologram....so..relax..&quot;
<br />

<br />
After a seemingly eternal wait, Packbell returned dangling the princess in
<br />
one of his hands. Sonic rotated a bit more, causing Robotnik to wheeze in
<br />
pain, &quot;I don't believe you 'buttnik.. too bad..&quot; Again the hedgehog edged
<br />
a few more degrees, cutting a bit deeper.
<br />
Packbell, picked up a bolt, and threw it against Sally's abdomen, it bounced
<br />
off. Sonic stopped slashing, &quot;Sal.. is that you?&quot;
<br />
Sally looked at him sadly, &quot;Sonic, forget me!&quot;
<br />
Robotnik's eyes exploded with fear, &quot;If you kill me boy, you'll be burrying
<br />
your little friend in a bottle!&quot;
<br />
Sonic smiled, &quot;Maybe.. maybe not!&quot; he rotated 10 degrees, blood began
<br />
torrenting out of the slash.
<br />

<br />
Packbell didn't waste any time, he pulled the pistol he had acquired while
<br />
fetching Sally and blasted the hedgehog.
<br />

<br />
But before Sonic was unconcious, he managed to rotate another thirty=
<br />
&nbsp;degrees,
<br />
rupturing one on Robotnik's major arteries, and as the blue blaze fell,
<br />
a red blurr complemented him as it sprayed at the ceiling.
<br />

<br />
Robotnik frantically felt around on his neck, after five more squirts he
<br />
found the fatal-cut and held it closed with his robotic arm. Then in a cool
<br />
collected voice, looked down at the pathetic heap on the floor. &quot;Ironic=
<br />
&nbsp;isn't
<br />
it rodent.. the more you try to hurt me, the more you help me..&quot; he glanced
<br />
at his robotic arm. Then rolling Sonic over with a softish kick, dictated to
<br />
Packbell. &quot;Begin Rendering.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />
When Sonic awoke he was laying strapped to a bed, on the bed next to him was
<br />
Sally. And looming above him, with an array of bandages on his throat was
<br />
Robotnik. He smiled evily, &quot;hedgehog, I would kill you now, but I thought
<br />
it would be so much better if your friends joined in the experience.. that's
<br />
why I have released a new video.. thanks to technology invented...&quot;
<br />
A hover-screen began showing the next premiere, this time Sonic getting
<br />
robotocized, and doing morbid interrogations employing his splines.
<br />
It ended with Robo-Sal and Robo-hog emracing one another, telling the other
<br />
freedom fighters what a great time they were having.
<br />
Robotnik left, the metal door clanging shut, leaving them in the cold,
<br />
dark, damp, musty room.
<br />

<br />
Sonic wanted to be sick, he could see it now, Tails.. trembling as Bunny=
<br />
&nbsp;tried
<br />
to explain his hero's &quot;robotocization&quot;. He could see the little fox's hair
<br />
standing on end, tears pouring down his face, his voice wavering--hoping for
<br />
some miracle. He could see him waving his fist... screaming..
<br />

<br />
No, he could not let that happen, he stressed against the restraints with
<br />
a new-found energy. He pulled with all his might, but finally, his energy
<br />
gave way and he just lay there looking up at the ceiling.
<br />
Across from him he heard Sally's straps creaking like leather as she too
<br />
tried to escape... after a few moments it ended with her voice.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sonic.. have you got a plan?&quot;
<br />
He struggled again, &quot;.. wish I did..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Just then a metallic-scraping noise came from across the room, it was
<br />
followed by metallic foot-steps, which neither of the freedom fighters
<br />
could witness from their position. Sally strained to look to her left,
<br />
&quot;Sonic.. there's something there.. mmmpppffff!&quot;
<br />
&quot;Sal.. what's going on?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sal?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sally?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&lt;Click!&gt; &lt;[Thud]&gt;
<br />

<br />
Sonic paused, desperation covering his face, what was going on? He tried
<br />
the best he could to look left, but failed against the straps. He stressed
<br />
with all his might, then futily let his head fall back.
<br />

<br />
Something soft covered his mouth, he struggled frantically before something
<br />
familiar came to him... that smell... it reminded him of...
<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;
<br />
A strange feeling came over his legs, something that made them feel cold.
<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;
<br />
Another feeling came, this time over his stomach, then a voice whispered
<br />
to him as the hand withdrew itself from over his mouth. &quot;..Relax..&quot;
<br />
&lt;Click!&gt;
<br />

<br />
The final strap gave way, allowing him to sit up and observe the scene,
<br />
Sally was standing by his head, while across from her was his Uncle.
<br />
&quot;Uncle..Ch!&quot;
<br />
&quot;SHHHH!&quot;
<br />

<br />
He jumped off the bed, shocked, then began, this time in a softer voice &quot;I
<br />
thought.. I thought we were never going to..&quot;
<br />
With that Sally embraced the hedgehog, a warm tear running down her soft=
<br />
&nbsp;face.
<br />
The moment didn't last long however, Sonic quickly remembered the=
<br />
&nbsp;propaganda.
<br />
&quot;Shi.. We've got to stop Robotnik, he's got that video!&quot;
<br />
His uncled patted him assuringly on the back, &quot;There's no need to worry,=
<br />
&nbsp;I've
<br />
already sent a message to Knothole, so..&quot; he smiled, &quot;time is on your=
<br />
&nbsp;hands.&quot;
<br />

<br />
Sonic's sigh of relief was cut-off abruptly as the door made a metallic
<br />
clang--someone was unlocking it!
<br />
Sonic propelled his uncle back into the air-duct and replaced the grating.
<br />
The door began to slide open, firing a beam of brilliant light in from the
<br />
ionizer-lights in the hallway.
<br />

<br />
Before Snively even had a chance to realise what had happened, he was laying
<br />
strapped to one of the beds, with a less than pleased hedgehog looming over
<br />
him. &quot;Securi...mmaaaammmgg!&quot;; Sonic stuffed some of the bedding in his=
<br />
&nbsp;mouth.
<br />

<br />

<br />
A moment later they were gone.

_______________________________
<br />

<br />
David (Pistone) was sitting at home watching his Sonic clips for the
<br />
4357th time when something odd happened, there came a rumbling noise from
<br />
outside.. a booming, like a jet passing into supersonic flight.
<br />

<br />
He dived out of his house just in time to see a blue-ish blaze fill his
<br />
field-of-vision. &quot;Sonic!&quot; he called out.
<br />

<br />
However, he had made a fatal error,
<br />
and it cost him dearly, for what he mistook for a blue-spiny-thing was
<br />
in fact a high-voltage static discharge (Lightning for normal people); the
<br />
shard of energy ran through his body, causing mass-electrolysis. As such,
<br />
stopping him from ever getting cellulite, and at the same time, altering him
<br />
on the structural level.
<br />

<br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;From that night forth, things began to change, he grew hair all over his=
</em><br />
&nbsp;body,
<br />
(Even his palms!), he started growing a tail (Which he got caught in the
<br />
lawnmower.. OUCH!) Then he did the final thing, he changed his name to
<br />
&nbsp;BOOKSHIRE DRAFTWOOD! [Echo/Reverb and Oversample FX here]
<br />

<br />
Then started a &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; page on the Internet.

<br />

<br />
&quot;Sal, why're we here?&quot;
<br />
Sally walked over to a set of probes lying on the floor, &quot;I've got an=
<br />
&nbsp;idea..&quot;
<br />
Picking up a metallic unit she began rattling on it's keys, Sonic stood and
<br />
watched, he wasn't big in the computer thing. He began tapping his foot, the
<br />
waiting was really getting to him, he looked at the wall, at the ceiling, at
<br />
Sal again, stopped for a moment, and then restarted the whole process.
<br />

<br />
A few minutes later Sally made an intelligent noise, Sonic expectantly
<br />
looked at her, but she continued toying with the device.
<br />
More time passed, Sonic made another observation of the walls.
<br />

<br />
Finally Sally stopped, &quot;Okay, see those gloves over there?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Yes?&quot;
<br />
&quot;Put them and the other sensors on...&quot;
<br />
&quot;But Sal...&quot;
<br />
&quot;Just do it, I have a plan.&quot;
<br />

<br />

<br />

<br />
Robotnik mumbled as he walked into the medical bay,
<br />
&quot;My dear hedgehog, I have another video for... SNIVELY!&quot; He almost tripped
<br />
in awe, &quot;SNIVELY NO! What THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE!&quot;
<br />

<br />
His nephew shrugged in fear, &quot;mmmpharrghoon!&quot; Robotnik went into dimmented
<br />
laughter, &quot;Mmmpphaargoon! Is that all you can say for yourself!
<br />
Mmmmphhaargoon! Mmmphharrgoon! You let the hedgehog escape.. and that's all
<br />
you can say! Mmmmpharrgoon!&quot;
<br />
He ripped the sheet out of Snively's mouth, &quot;Is there anything you would
<br />
like to add to that?&quot;
<br />

<br />
&quot;Yes, you old coot, IF YOU HADN'T SCREWED UP AND THOUGHT THAT GUARDS WEREN'T
<br />
NEEDED, THEN they wouldn't be free now WOULD THEY.. WOULD THEY!!!&quot;
<br />
but instead Snively simply made a pathetic whimper which was soon drowned
<br />
out as a multitude of punch combos rained down on him.
<br />

<br />
A few minutes later Robotnik was even more annoyed, his only means of
<br />
relieving stress had passed out, he shuffled out the room, leaving his
<br />
nephew still strapped to the bed. &quot;..Mmmphaargoon! &quot;
<br />

<br />
Entering the hallway he glared at everything that passed him as he headed=
<br />
&nbsp;for
<br />
his personal quarters, abruptly he stopped, remembering something. Lifting
<br />
up a nifty little communicator he regained a grin. &quot;Control, are there any
<br />
prisoners we haven't interrogated yet?&quot; He stared across the hall as he
<br />
waited for a response.
<br />

<br />
&quot;Sorry, we have no prisoners..&quot; Robotnik stopped dead, Princess Sally was
<br />
walking just meters away, seemingly without noticing him she turned into
<br />
a room on his right. &quot;Sir?&quot; The communicator interrupted, &quot;Sir, will that
<br />
be tolerable?&quot;
<br />
Robotnik was already walking to the room his desire to inflict pain greater
<br />
than his logic, &quot;yes.. that will be more than adequete.. goodbye.&quot;
<br />

<br />
He stopped at the doorway, smiled, patted the bandages on his neck, then
<br />
whacked the open switch, ready to tear anything he saw into pieces with his
<br />
bare hands. But all he saw was the princess curled up at the end of the=
<br />
&nbsp;room,
<br />
in front of the fake robotocizer as if though she was sleeping,
<br />
his arms tingled with morbid desires.
<br />
He (almost) floated forward, chanting as he went, &quot;my dear princess...&quot;
<br />

<br />
Strangely she didn't seem shocked by his presence, not even turning around
<br />
to face him. &quot;Just go away..&quot; she moaned.
<br />
He wasn't used to being dictated to, &quot;WHAT!?!&quot;
<br />
&quot;I said, just go away, leave me alone..&quot;
<br />
&quot;What?&quot; Robotniks mind boggled.
<br />

<br />
He was now in close enough proximity to grab her, but he was far too shocked
<br />
for that. She was kneeling forward looking down, her face almost touching
<br />
the floor. He himself kneeled, curious as to what she was doing.
<br />

<br />
She rotated her head to face him, her face at the same height as his.
<br />
&quot;Julian..&quot; she smiled, &quot;there's only one thing your videos don't have..&quot;
<br />
He stared at her confused, until a voice came from behind, &quot;We need you!&quot;
<br />

<br />
The HEDGEHOG! He turned his head around in chaos, but at the same time,=
<br />
&nbsp;Sally
<br />
dropped a loop over his neck, and rolled backward, he turned back to grab
<br />
her, when suddenly the situation asserted itself. The cord jerked, dragging
<br />
him into the digitizer, the glass cylinder lowered, entrapping him inside.
<br />

<br />
His threats were cut off as the tube fully completed it's descent, Sonic
<br />
grinned at the squirrel, &quot;Show-time!&quot;
<br />
&lt;CLICK!&gt;
<br />
A yellow beam began to immerse the overlord, who continually banged against
<br />
the glass. His yells being reduced to a dulled groan.
<br />

<br />
Eventually the fun was over, the beam finished digitizing him; He started to
<br />
bang at the glass again, this time even cracking it. Then Sonic walked
<br />
towards him, grinned, looked back to the princess, and after a flash of
<br />
light changed to look just like him!
<br />

<br />
Sonic chuckled beneath his photon covering, Sally had beem right, the
<br />
squirrel walked over to him, pushed the holographic computer into the
<br />
hologram, took some cuffs off a wall, put them on, and then walked off with
<br />
Son-botnik posing as his prisoner.

The glass shattered under another blow, and Robotnik was free, he grabbed
<br />
a rifle off a weapons rack, and headed into the main hall, calling to
<br />
swat-bots as he went.
<br />

<br />
They crowded around him, and then suddenly, grabbed him. He heard his=
<br />
&nbsp;nephews
<br />
voice resounding from down the hall, &quot;Let's see what this..imposter has to
<br />
say after *WE* do some convincing...&quot; Then Packbells voice added, &quot;Well, I=
<br />
&nbsp;do
<br />
need a subject for that new experiment of mine..&quot;
<br />

<br />
Robotnik squirmed, &quot;Fools! This is me!&quot;
<br />
Snively walked over in a non-standard attitude and punched him on the nose,
<br />
&quot;Robotnik is powerfull, you're just plain pathetic hedgehog!&quot;
<br />
Ivo roared with anger, &quot;SNIVELY!&quot;
<br />
Packbell just smiled, &quot;We'll see how long that act lasts for. Swat-bots, to
<br />
my laboratory!&quot;

<br />

<br />
&quot;Brilliant&quot; Simon smiled as he studied the DNA string his measly 486DX40 had
<br />
churned out, &quot;it's perfect!&quot; He popped the disk into his molecular
<br />
reorganizer--a brilliant system capable of turning digital DNA strings into
<br />
their real world equivalents. (And running OaSis/2)
<br />

<br />
The machine finally came to a halt, spewing out the product, a creature
<br />
with eight legs and a long tail. It's body was completely covered in
<br />
Silicon.
<br />

<br />
&quot;How Cute!&quot; the human commented as it hugged onto his face and wrapped it's
<br />
tail around his throat.
<br />

<br />
After a day however he grew bored of it, and after finding it rather hard
<br />
to detach, donned a scalpel. With a little trimmin, it dropped neatly off.
<br />
When he picked it up, he found to his dismay that it was dead, &quot;bummer&quot; he
<br />
said to himself, and then looking again, &quot;Shit! Ma's gonna kill me, that
<br />
cute thingies acidic blood has eaten right through the carpet!&quot;
<br />

<br />
Later on that day, Simon had some indigestion while eating his favourite
<br />
food--fetta cheese. In the process another creature just like the one he had
<br />
thrown on the garbage dump, (after playing with it with the lawn roller),
<br />
ruptured out of his stomach.
<br />

<br />
As he dropped to the floor in agony he said to himself, &quot;Darn, I don't like
<br />
those things anymore.. but I'll let that sucker get away.. after all,
<br />
what harm can *one* little alien do anyway?&quot;
<br />

<br />
Without a digestive system Simon no longer drinks coffie, and has resorted=
<br />
&nbsp;to
<br />
injecting caffeine instead, he currently holds the task of protecting the
<br />
planet Earth from &quot;Killer-mutant-off-road-racing-mice-from-Mars.&quot;
