<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Gee, Is it just me or hace things quited down a bit? Don't be shy, Post your
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; questions or start a subjuct. Has anyone heard of the sonic movie? It was
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; mentioned in the cominc book. But here is a good question,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Will it be live action or cartoon? And who thinks it would be better as a live
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; action movie? I think it would be great. I...hope they do a better job on it
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; then was done to mario bros. Just my 2 cents. What do you think?
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; Craig / Tails
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt; &gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; If there's a God in Heaven, PLEASE!!!! don't let it be a live action
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; film!  Maybe it worked with TMNT, but that's about it.  Anyone remember
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; &quot;Howard the Duck?&quot;  George Lucas directing, $40 million and STILL the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; thing was more turkey than duck!  To quote another toon: &quot;Spew and a
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; half!&quot;  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt; 
</em><br />
Besides, how in the world could they do it?  &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; involved
<br />
one animal character, and TMNT involved 5.  This would be an entire planet!
<br />
(or at least a city, depending on how in depth they want to show this
<br />
place).
<br />

<br />
I vote animation.  I know it's too much to hope for when I say I want
<br />
story-telling along the lines of &quot;Watership Down&quot; (BTW, just bought the
<br />
book!), so here's hoping they'll at least treat it the way Bluth did &quot;The
<br />
Secret of NIMH&quot;.
<br />

<br />
Which raises a whole plethora of new questions:
<br />

<br />
1).  How would the movie be set in with the TV show/comic book?
<br />

<br />
Would you want a prequel (maybe telling the story of Robotnik's initial
<br />
take-over and how all the characters came to be where they are), an alternate
<br />
story (sorta like &quot;TMNT&quot; or &quot;Batman&quot; or just about any other super-hero
<br />
movie), or perhaps a continuation of the cartoon (assuming the show doesn't
<br />
get renewed)?  The &quot;prequel&quot; is probably the least likely, since nowadays
<br />
movies have to have a definite ending, and preferably a happy one.
<br />

<br />
2).  Who would do the voices?
<br />

<br />
Should we keep Jaleel and the rest of the gang, or take this opportunity
<br />
to expose some bigger names (Tim Curry notwithstanding) to the Sonic universe?
<br />
Not that I'm trying to dismiss any of the Sat. morning stars.  I still have
<br />
yet to see any of 'em myself!
<br />

<br />
3).  Who would produce the movie?
<br />

<br />
If Bluth were still making movies the way he used to, I'd want him in a
<br />
heartbeat, but lately he seems burnt-out (&quot;Thumbelina&quot;?)  Disney making
<br />
it would be a double-edged sword; sure the animation would be top-notch,
<br />
but the story might be a little too Hollywood.  And I don't want these
<br />
guys singing when there is a global war going on! :-)  What if a Japanese
<br />
company did it--Sonic anime?  That would be cool!!
<br />

<br />
And, of course, we could get really nit-picky and discuss who we want
<br />
for writer, music (orchestral, electronic, or pop?), music composer, etc.
<br />

<br />
okay, it's debate time!
<br />

<br />
later---Kris
