<em class="quotelev1">&gt;	Has anyone ever noticed...Sonic and Co, NEVER seem to age, or Grow.
</em><br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I suppose there are a couple of ways to look at this. In most of
<br />
the fan-fic which is written by all of the Sonic fans, the storyline is very
<br />
serious and plausible. (IMHO, these stories seem to work better.) Because of
<br />
this serious tone and parallel to our reality, I assume that, if the stories
<br />
went on for a long enough time, the characters would age, grow, and
<br />
eventually die. (&quot;Bloodlines&quot; is a good example of this. If there are others
<br />
which follow this trend, I apologize to the respective authors, as I haven't
<br />
had time to read them yet.) However, in the Archie series, the games, and
<br />
the other &quot;official&quot; Sonic fare, no one ever seems to age. Perhaps it's
<br />
because the creators and authors adopt the standard cartoon character ideas
<br />
and eliminate aging all together. Think about it. Out of all of the cartoon
<br />
characters out there, how many have ever aged? Sure, some have had
<br />
birthdays, but never on a regualr basis , plus they never change otherwise. 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One example to the contrary would be &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;, the
<br />
syndicated comic strip. The characters age just as realistically and
<br />
perfectly as their real-life counterparts. On the other hand, Garfield has
<br />
birthdays every year but doesn't really change. He technically should have
<br />
died a few years back from old age. (He's turning 18 in a few months.) From
<br />
Calvin and Hobbes, Calvin always goes on summer vacation, yet always goes
<br />
back to First grade with Susie Derkins and Miss Wormwood. (Alas, no longer.)
<br />
Many of the other cartoons which have been on the comic pages for decades
<br />
haven't changed much at all. (Beetle Bailey, Hagar the Horrible, Etc.) 
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though i said up above that I prefer the stories with a serious
<br />
tone(I am NOT flaming the other authors. Their work is equally enjoyable,
<br />
but on a different level. I could only hope to write so well.), I'm not sure
<br />
I would want Sonic to age very much. If he grew older, he would gain
<br />
maturity at the expense of his natural spunk and cool attitude which define
<br />
the character we all love. We all change with time. Maybe the characters'
<br />
creators didn't want them to change because they liked them the way they are? 
<br />

<br />
Just my thoughts...
<br />

<br />
