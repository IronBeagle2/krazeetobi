Dear friends
<br />

<br />
BB: First of all, if it was a future Earth, why isn't it still called Earth?
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, at the current rate of technological development, I'm sure that
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sally would own something much better than a simple hand-held computer
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nicole's not so bad.  She does seem to have a huge database, and artifi-
<br />
cial intelligence. :-)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm thinking that perhaps human culture somehow died off when humans no
<br />
longer were the prevalent sentient species.  So some aspects like Earth's name
<br />
were lost/replaced, but others like Bunnie's and Antoine's accents survived.
<br />
But now I'm having these &quot;Mad Max/Thundarr&quot; flashbacks. :-)
<br />

<br />
BB: My theory is that Mobius is another planet.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe Earthlings colonized it with some humans and animals genetically 
<br />
engineered to evolve to sentient species.
<br />

<br />
BB: (Question: why are all humans bent on world domination?)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of them? :-)  I wonder if there are any other humans left besides 
<br />
Robotnik and Snivelly.
<br />

<br />
BJI: &gt;an exact number for the age of maturity.  So, 15 + 2 = 17, no? :)
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, no. Sally *did* say she wouldn't come of age until 18.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So she's 15, going on 16. :-)  It's probably a couple of months before
<br />
her 16th. birthday.
<br />

<br />
CB: What was the most unsettling when I saw the cartoon was how thin Sally was.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tootsi Pop physiques seem to be common in cartoons.  I'm happy that the
<br />
creators are taking her design more seriously in drawing her not as thin as
<br />
before.
<br />

<br />
DJD: &quot;Fortified&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mawhinney, though, seems to draw her a little on the &quot;squashed&quot; side.  
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely.  Mawhinney did an excellent job with the characters in the 
<br />
&quot;Princess Sally&quot; miniseries.  But he seems to have particular trouble drawing
<br />
Bunnie.  Her torso looks like it's been mashed in between her appendages.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bunnie was featured in the last page of Sonic #25, but she's put behind
<br />
the credits.  Shame.
<br />

<br />
DJD: as far as I'm concerned they are of dubious canonical value. 
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There's just no way the daily series could be in the same continuity as
<br />
the weekly series.  The formats are just too different.  The daily series is 
<br />
a bad imitation of old Warner Bros. cartoons, and it has no explanation for 
<br />
its premise.  I'd rather it be just another of those parallel universes alluded
<br />
to in the comic book, one I'd rather not visit. :-) ( Scratch, Grounder and
<br />
Coconuts did make some appearances in the comic book, but thankfully they seem
<br />
to be gone now. )
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, at least the daily series has Miss Possum. :-)
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See ya around.
<br />

<br />
Sincerely -
<br />

<br />
Juan F. Lara
