<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;This story was designed with the least possible added characters,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;[Oh sure, it has Bookshire or Packbell], but unlike some stories I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;seen, it doesn't:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Alter the storyline from there on.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Jaded Views didn't alter the storyline; it didn't even mention it!!!  &lt;VBG&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Add characters that represent the writer. [Becoming hero's of=
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; course!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;HEEEEEY!!!!  I only added X because that's the way the Prodigy Sonic club's
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;been doing it forever, and besides, I got ENOUGH irritated responses (all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;right, one) from the club members I didn't include!  Besides, if it makes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;anybody feel any better, X didn't have any better role than Sonic!  (And
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;besides that, now that I think of it, your attack is more appropriate to my
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;friend Eric's story, and I REALLY LIKED THAT STORY!!!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Forget about Sonic and focus on some other hero. [Who steals the=
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt; show]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, how am I supposed to introduce Maxl/Jade/Tracker without them having
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;a big part of the story?  Besides, there were others that did that and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remained really good: The entire Tolouse Trilogy, the stories involving
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;David Prower, and probably plenty of others I either haven't read yet or am
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;too lazy to mention!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Have any mega-depressing parts. [That force me to meditate!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Hey!  I LIKED Bloodlines and On My Mother's Grave!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Have any ninja's.  [PHEWW!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Ninjas?!  Where????!!!!  I guess I haven't read that one yet...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    #) Exceed 80 Chars on the X-axis. [Ahahahha!]
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Use a word processor that won't let it, and your troubles are over!
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(Bunnie's Bad Day was fine in Microsoft Word!)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Well, now that I'm finished defending myself, I'd like to say that very few
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;of these &lt;ahem&gt; &quot;problems&quot; will occur in my next story, The Hunt Begins
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(except maybe the mega-depressing part, although it definitely won't be as
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;sad as On My Mother's Grave or Bloodlines), in which Sonic pretty much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;remains the hero and very few third-party characters are mentioned (I would
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;give you a list of characters who DO, but it you'd think it was longer than
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;it actually is, because of various complicated events that I'm not about to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;give away before the story's finished).  I personally think it's the best
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Sonic story I've written in quite a while (which isn't really saying much
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;since the only other one in the past few months is Jaded Views, which isn't
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;exactly my best work, whether I defend it or not), and it'll be worth the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;wait, but that's for you to decide!
</em><br />

<br />
You seem to give me the impression that you feel like I'm pointing you out
<br />
or something.. &lt;MBG&gt; But don't worry, I've written two stories that would
<br />
get killed by my &quot;it doesn't thingy&quot;   I still have to release the stories,
<br />
but I just wondered how I would do at writing a Sonic only story.. That's all.
<br />

<br />
And &quot;Bloodlines&quot;, and &quot;On my mothers grave&quot; and most of the stories are
<br />
brilliant, the depression adds to the story. The whole Tolouse series I find
<br />
exceptionally good. My &quot;it doesn't&quot; thingie doesn't discredit the stories
<br />
that do include fan-fiction created characters, nor does it discredit
<br />
stories that have ninjas in, or are depressing. It simply says that this
<br />
story, won't have any of that in: 
<br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;but unlike some stories I've
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;seen, it doesn't:
</em><br />

<br />
See? 
<br />

<br />
And for the info, I enjoyed ninety-five percent of the stories, Yes, I had
<br />
to meditate after that one night I read about five stories where freedom
<br />
fighters are getting thrown away like disposable diapers, but I still
<br />
enjoyed the stories. There were only a few, that I naturally, won't mention,
<br />
that I didn't enjoy. Generally I found this to be because the stories were
<br />
huge spelling and grammar mistakes on such a level no mere human could make
<br />
head or &quot;Tails&quot; of it.
<br />

<br />
Okay, so don't anyone flame me now, I didn't say YOUR story sucked, just
<br />
some stories. (5%)
<br />

<br />
Let me guess now, someone is going to come to me and say: &quot;Hey Si, none of
<br />
the stories suck, so therefore you are saying that five percent of MY story
<br />
sucks!&quot;
<br />

<br />
ARGHHH!
<br />

<br />
Cheers
<br />
Ablater
