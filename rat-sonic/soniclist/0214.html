<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />

<br />
================================================================
<br />

<br />
Q1: How did Tails come to have two tails?
<br />
A: The writers of Sonic comics solicited reader responses to this
<br />
in issue #___; the replies were printed in issue #___.  They
<br />
range from transplantation to mutation.  At this point, there is
<br />
no &quot;official&quot; explanation as to how Tails got that way, so you're
<br />
pretty much free to believe what you like.  Personally, I prefer
<br />
the theory that it is a mutation, induced by Robotnik's pollution
<br />
of Mobius. This would accord with the fact that Tails had not
<br />
been born when Robotnik took over (cf. Q6).
<br />

<br />
Q2: Is &quot;Tails&quot; his real name?
<br />
A:   No, his real name is &quot;Miles Prower&quot; (you have to say it
<br />
sorta fast to get the joke).  That was his name when he was
<br />
introduced on the front screen of the Sonic 2 video game.  Tails
<br />
was given as his nickname, and it stuck.
<br />

<br />
Q3: Is Tails related to Sally?  He calls her &quot;Aunt Sally&quot; quite
<br />
often.
<br />
A:This argument has been put forward by the &quot;Sally is a fox&quot; camp
<br />
(see below).  However, if that were true, then he'd also be
<br />
related to Bunnie, as he's been known to address her as &quot;Aunt
<br />
Bunnie.&quot;  For that matter, it seems that everyone in the Knothole
<br />
gang refers to Sir Charles Hedgehog as &quot;Uncle Chuck,&quot; though he's
<br />
technically only uncle to Sonic.
<br />

<br />
While it was not explicitly stated in either the comics or in the
<br />
cartoons, it has to be kept in mind that all of the freedom
<br />
fighters' families were disrupted by Robotnik's takeover of
<br />
Mobius.  It's safe to assume that they all have had relatives who
<br />
have ended up being roboticized.  As a result, they have become
<br />
not so much a paramilitary resistance group as a loose-knit
<br />
family.  Sonic, for instance, clearly relates to Tails as if the
<br />
latter was his little brother, the difference in species
<br />
notwithstanding.
<br />

<br />
Q4: I can't figure out what kinds of animals some of the
<br />
characters are supposed to be.
<br />
A:   Admittedly, it's trickier to spot some species in the series
<br />
than others.  Herewith is the list:
<br />
Sonic and Sir Charles. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .hedgehogs
<br />
Bunnie . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . rabbit
<br />
Tails. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Rotor. . . . . . . . . . . . . .walrus (sea lion, cf. Teitelbaum)
<br />
Antoine. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />
Sally Acorn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ground squirrel/chipmunk
<br />
Sally's father . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .fox
<br />

<br />
The identification of Sally as a ground squirrel is based on
<br />
extended discussion of the topic on Internet {alt.fan.furry and
<br />
rec.arts.animation).  She was also declared to be a ground
<br />
squirrel in the comics, most recently in the Sonicgram of Sonic
<br />
#19.
<br />

<br />
Despite this statement, controversy continues.  Identifying
<br />
Sally's species has been particularly vexing to some fans,
<br />
especially those who reason that since Sally's father is clearly
<br />
a fox, then she must be one herself.  It is possible that Sally
<br />
takes after her mother in this regard more than her father. 
<br />
Cross-species mating is a definite possibility, and an example is
<br />
implied in the &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of &quot;Sally's Crusade&quot;
<br />
[Sonic: In Your Face #1].
<br />

<br />
At this point, the identification of Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
remains ambiguous.  Given her buck teeth, she could be either a
<br />
beaver or a woodchuck.  Since she is always shown wearing a long
<br />
cloak, I've been unable to spot the character beaver tail.  Final
<br />
identification is still pending.
<br />

<br />
Q5: &quot;Sally Acorn&quot;?
<br />
A: This is how she was identified in the Sonic-Gram Extra, vol.  
<br />
1, no. 1, Winter 94-95; I am still trying to identify a first
<br />
usage of the name.  Technically, royalty do not have         
<br />
surnames or family names in the accepted sense; rather, the title
<br />
of the personage tends to serve the purpose.  Her middle name,
<br />
Alicia, is apparently seldom used (cf. &quot;Blast to the Past,&quot; part
<br />
1).  If you wanted to be grandiose about it, Sally's formal title
<br />
would be: Sally Alicia, Princess of the House of Acorn.  But in
<br />
any event it's unlikely that Sally's formal title will come back
<br />
into use so long as Robotnik is in charge.
<br />

<br />
Q6: How old are the characters supposed to be?
<br />
A:   According to the TV series [&quot;Blast to the Past: part 1&quot;]
<br />
Sonic and Sally were both 5 years old when Sally's father was
<br />
overthrown and Robotnik took over.  Two other age clues were
<br />
given in the &quot;Drood Henge&quot; episode: that Tails was 10 years old,
<br />
and that Sally wouldn't &quot;come of age&quot; for another two years. 
<br />
Presuming that the age of majority on Mobius is 18, that would
<br />
mean Sonic and Sally are both 16 years old, though the comics
<br />
reportedly put both at age 15.  Subtracting 5 from 16 leaves the
<br />
number of years Robotnik has been in charge: 11.  Thus, it would
<br />
appear that Tails was born after the fall of the House of Acorn. 
<br />
Still, the simplest way out of this dilemma would be to put the
<br />
age of majority on Mobius at 17 instead of 18; that would
<br />
eliminate the extra year differential without altering the stated
<br />
ages of Sonic and Sally (in the comics) or of Tails (in &quot;Drood
<br />
Henge&quot;).
<br />

<br />
Q7: What happened to the Princess Sally miniseries?
<br />
A:   Archie Comics was supposed to roll out a three-part
<br />
miniseries starring Sally as the main character.  The story
<br />
actually began with &quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot; in Sonic #20.  The
<br />
cover art for the miniseries, however, differs in subsequent
<br />
advertisements: one cover for the first issue prominently
<br />
features Geoffrey St. John, while another does not.  The third
<br />
issue cover either does or doesn't feature Sally doing battle
<br />
with a clone of herself, depending upon where you see it.  The
<br />
fact that the Sally creative team PLUS Archie Comics PLUS Sega
<br />
reportedly came together to discuss &quot;improving&quot; the series (as
<br />
reported in the Sonicgram for Sonic #21) would seem to indicate
<br />
that someone had come down with a case of &quot;creative differences.&quot;
<br />
In any event, the &quot;improved&quot; Sally miniseries began shipping the
<br />
week of Feb 13.

<br />
mistake at the end of the second season?
<br />

<br />
Sub-Sonic
<br />
Writer: Barbara Slade

On a raid of Robotropolis, Sonic runs into Muttski, his now-
<br />
roboticized pet dog and vows to return him to normal someday. 
<br />
The freedom fighters also have to contend with a squadron of
<br />
Buzzbombers carrying an orange defoliant [Agent Orange? 
<br />
Hmmmm...] intent on destroying the Great Forest and exposing

Sonic rescues someone from capture by Robotnik; he turns out to
<br />
be Ari, a freedom fighter from another group.  Ari directs Sonic
<br />
to a place which turns out to be a trap.  Sonic manages to escape
<br />
(after Robotnik toys with him), but Ari--whose comrades were
<br />
roboticized and who was himself deceived by Robotnik--is sucked
<br />
into the Void.  Before falling into the Void, Ari says something
<br />
about a list of other freedom fighters.
<br />

<br />
Sonic Conversion
<br />
The Knothole gang test a deroboticizing process on Bunnie, whose
<br />
partially-roboticized body is returned to normal.  Sonic then
<br />
goes after Uncle Chuck and is able to convince him to undergo the
<br />
process.  However, the process turns out to be only temporary as,
<br />
in a poignant scene, Bunnie reverts to a half-robot.  When Uncle
<br />
Chuck reverts to robotic form, he captures Tails and Antoine for
<br />
delivery to Robotnik; Sonic confronts him and manages to break
<br />
the hold on Uncle Chuck's mind.  Uncle Chuck returns to
<br />
Robotropolis to work as a spy for the Knothole gang.
<br />

<br />
No Brainer
<br />
Sonic's thought processes are temporarily scrambled while on a
<br />
mission in Robotropolis.  Taking advantage of the situation,
<br />
Snively convinces Sonic that they are friends.  The disruption
<br />
wears off just as the Knothole gang face immanent capture.
<br />

<br />
Blast to the Past (two parts)
<br />
Dulcy takes Sonic and Sally to a floating island where they use
<br />
the Time Stones to return to Mobotropolis on the eve of the
<br />
planet's conquest by Dr. Robotnik (then known as Julian,
<br />
affiliated with the War Ministry and supposedly in charge of its
<br />
dismantling).  They also encounter themselves as 5-year-olds and
<br />
learn that it was Sonic's Uncle Chuck who had perfected the
<br />
roboticizer process in the first place, though Julian/Robotnik
<br />
stole the process.  Sally and Sonic work to keep their child
<br />
selves from being roboticized, to prevent the Great Forest from
<br />
being destroyed, and to make sure that Sally's nanny, Rosie,
<br />
would not get captured.
<br />

<br />
Fed Up With Antoine/Ghost Busted (back to back episodes)
<br />
Feeling unappreciated, Antoine allows himself to be made &quot;king&quot;
<br />
by a group of renegades, unaware that with the office comes the
<br />
&quot;honor&quot; of being an entree./While out camping, Sonic's ghost
<br />
story panics Tails, and Antoine once more demonstrates his
<br />
ineptitude.
<br />

<br />
Dulcy
<br />
Dulcy begins having overpowering urges to fly to Dragonsnest, a
<br />
nesting site for female dragons.  She, Sonic and Sally, arrive
<br />
just as Robotnik has captured another female dragon; they then
<br />
discover the dragon's egg inside Dragonsnest.  Taking the egg
<br />
back to Knothole, they rescue the female dragon who returns in
<br />
time to hatch the egg.
<br />

<br />
The Void
<br />
Sonic discovers an opening to the Void while out in the &quot;Great
<br />
Unknown&quot; [another name for the Forbidden Zone?].  Sally and
<br />
Bunnie are put under a spell and pulled into the Void by a
<br />
sorcerer named Naugus, who had been imprisoned there years before
<br />
by Robotnik and who needs Sonic's speed to escape.  Sonic learns
<br />
what has happened from Nicole and allows himself to be pulled
<br />
into the Void.  Attempting to rescue Sally and Bunnie, he is
<br />
tricked into rescuing what he thinks is Sally's father but is
<br />
really Naugus.  Sonic returns to the Void and finds not only
<br />
Sally and Bunnie but the King and Ari as well.  He brings them
<br />
all out, but Naugus and the King have spent so much time in the
<br />
Void that their bodies cannot handle living on Mobius.  Naugus
<br />
breaks off his tormenting of Robotnik, and Sally's father gives
<br />
her the list of other resistance groups.  On the whole, Sally
<br />
goes through the emotional rollercoaster ride of her life.
<br />

<br />
The Odd Couple/Ro-Becca (back to back episodes)
<br />
After a crash landing by Dulcy leaves Sonic homeless he moves in
<br />
with Antoine, who predictably gets bent out of shape by Sonic's
<br />
lifestyle./Rotor cobbles together a robot which develops the hots
<br />
for Antoine.
<br />

<br />
Cry of the Wolf
<br />
The Knothole freedom fighters search for and discover the Wolf
<br />
Pack, the remnants of an ancient race who are now one of the
<br />
other resistance groups.  After several unsuccessful attempts to
<br />
destroy a test pod from the Doomsday Project, Sonic draws it into
<br />
a lightning storm and destroys it.
<br />

<br />
Drood Henge
<br />
Sonic and Tails discover an archaeological dig by Robotnik; they
<br />
learn from Nicole that the object of the search is the Deep Power
<br />
Stones, and that Robotnik has recovered one of the two.  Tails
<br />
comes up with a plan to retrieve the second stone before Robotnik
<br />
can get to it.
<br />

<br />
Spyhog
<br />
On the eve of final preparations of the Doomsday project,
<br />
Robotnik begins to suspect that there is a spy in his midst. 
<br />
Uncle Chuck's cover is blown, but he escapes capture and goes
<br />
back underground with a different cover.
<br />

<br />
Doomsday
<br />
In the season finale, a combined force of the five freedom
<br />
fighter groups tries to destroy the Doomsday project.  Robotnik,
<br />
however, seems to have too many safeguards built in.  As a last
<br />
resort, Sonic and Sally use the Deep Power Stones.  The Doomsday
<br />
project is destroyed; Robotnik's fate is uncertain but Snively is
<br />
ready to step into his shoes in a burst of megalomania and
<br />
overacting.  Cliffhanger: who or what does Snively have to help
<br />
him?  And will there be a third season?

[CONTRIBUTIONS WELCOME]
<br />

<br />
#18 [Jan 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;
<br />
Robotnik gets word of Sonic and Sally's impending wedding and
<br />
plans an attack.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the Still of the Night&quot;
<br />
While trying to determine the nature of the mysterious orb (cf.
<br />
&quot;First Star....&quot;, #17), Sally is called to the bedside of her old
<br />
mentor, Julayla, just before she dies.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: includes statement that Sonic is 15, and a German
<br />
fan disses Dave Manak's artwork
<br />

<br />
Sonic: In Your Face #1 [1995]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Sally's Crusade: The Quest&quot;
<br />
The orb is revealed to be a casing surrounding Nicole.  Sally,
<br />
with the others in tow, searches for what turns out to be
<br />
Julayla's last testament. The significance of this document is
<br />
spelled out in a &quot;flashforward&quot; at the end of the story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mirror Zone&quot;
<br />
An excuse to practice backwards lettering.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Sally's age is given as &quot;about 15.&quot;  [Note, if
<br />
you're going to guess a lady's age, guess on the low side ;-) ]
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tails' Tallest Tale&quot;
<br />
Tails substitutes for Sonic, putting in an appearance at a con. 
<br />
His exaggerations almost get him into trouble.
<br />

<br />
#19 [Feb 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Night of a Thousand Sonics&quot;
<br />
In order to defeat Robotnik's latest scheme, Sonic has to call in
<br />
as many versions of himself from as many parallel universes as he
<br />
can.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: The name of Sally's father is given as &quot;King
<br />
Acorn&quot; (but see FAQ #5).  Scott Fulop hedges on when Knuckles
<br />
will make an appearance and whose side he'll be on.  Again, Sally
<br />
is identified as a &quot;ground squirrel.&quot;  Hint is dropped as to a
<br />
Sonic motion picture in the works.
<br />

<br />
#20 [Mar 1995]:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's the Spirit&quot;
<br />
Exposure to an antimatter explosion renders Sonic invisible;
<br />
Sally and the others [Tails being the exception] believe he is
<br />
dead.  The comedic pacing and Manak's artwork mar what otherwise
<br />
might have been a very poignant story.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Deadliest of the Species&quot;
<br />
[Prologue to the Princess Sally miniseries]
<br />
While on a sabotage mission, Sally is confronted by someone
<br />
claiming to be part of a rebel underground.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: Once again lists Sally's age as 15.
<br />

<br />
#21 [
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sonicgram: announcement of the delay in rolling out the
<br />
Sally miniseries; another special issue (48pp) due out in May.

<br />
_Sonic the Hedgehog: Robotnik's Revenge_ synopsis: one of the
<br />
Knothole freedom fighters is captured by Robotnik and used as
<br />
bait to lure Sonic into a trap.  In this case, the victim is
<br />
Bunnie, and the story supposedly explains how she came to be
<br />
partially roboticized.  This account is at odds with the
<br />
explanation in the comics.  In addition, both Uncle Chuck and
<br />
Muttski in this book has been successfully deroboticized, which
<br />
conflicts with &quot;Sonic Conversion&quot; and, in fact, the rest of the
<br />
second season.
