</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;To: sonic_at_bort.mv.net
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;What happened to &quot;sard.mv.net&quot;?
</em><br />
<br />Don't look at me.  I just work here.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Hello there. I'm Joseph from FurToonia, and I've recently discovered this
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;mailing list.  I'm a rather large Sonic fan, so I was rather dismayed when
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I finally realized ABC wasn't carryin StH anymore.  So...
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Took you this long, did it?  :^)
</em><br />
<br />I'm not that quick.  =)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;I wrote this message on the bulletin board on FurToonia.  I'm sending it,
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in a slightly altered form, to this list in hopes of arousing your interest
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;in my plan.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(most of message deleted)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;1.  The final episode.  If the last episode of Sonic the Hedgehog was not
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    the most extreme cliffhanger in the history of all Saturday morning
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    cartoons, I'm not orange.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;                       ^^^^^^
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Just what flavor of furry are you? :^)
</em><br />
<br />Now, now, let's leave SOMETHING to the imagination...  ;)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    Even the SWAT Kats ended with a modicum of closure; all of THEIR bad 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    guys were DEAD.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Interesting; I didn't know that (I gave up on SK since all I was doing was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;drooling over Callie and Felina, and that's not good for me...)
</em><br />
<br />Well, now you do.  (And what's wrong with that?  Sure, they aren't as hot
<br />
as, say, Bunnie Rabbot, but it's a step up from usual H-B fare.  =)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   What of Snively, and the mysterious eyes behind him?  What happened to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   Robotnik?  What about the King?  (Talk about your cartoonus 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   interruptus...) 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Heh!
</em><br />
<br />*bows*  I live to corrupt Latin.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;2.  This was a *good* show.  It gave all SORTS of good messages.  It was 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    pro-environment (the good guys live in peace with nature, badniks
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    destroy it), anti-pollution (ditto), 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But it was fairly subtle about it, unlike, say, Captain Planet...
</em><br />
<br />Nor did it suck more than a Shop-Vac with a V-12 implanted in it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;3.  It was also a &quot;good&quot; show in the respect that it was well-written and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    animated.  Very rarely does such a quality show end up on ABC, and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    especially during the SatAM merchandising-block.  It had drama.  Pathos.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    And it was *funny* sometimes, too.  It was a show that anyone of any
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    age could watch and appreciate on some level.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;The only other one that comes to mind was the first season of Ewoks.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;But actually Reboot has many of the same elements, but it's such a 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;different show that I'm not sure the comparison is valid.
</em><br />
<br />Well, if it's animated, it qualifies on SOME level.  (Reboot is cool, IMO.)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    And I'm sure these people would gladly buy any products that any sponsor 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    of the show would produce, and recommend X product to their friends.
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Depends on the product - I don't know about Sonic underwear, cereal, or 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;canned pasta product with imitation cheese :^)
</em><br />
<br />Well, that sort of stuff was done to death in the 80s, anyway.  =)
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;Now, here's what I'm thinking here...basically, all we do are these 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;three things:
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;2.  Then, a letter should immediately follow the previous message that one
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;    could send to (our main enemy) Sega.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;It has yet to be determined just who the &quot;enemy&quot; is here; Sega, DIC, or ABC.
</em><br />
<br />Well, here's how I think it went down:
<br />
<br />DiC, being the giving sort they are, sold some original StH cels somewhere.
<br />
Sega, sensing that they weren't getting a cut, promptly took away DiC's
<br />
rights to the show, and therefore ABC recieved no more of it.  It's not the
<br />
messenger, it's the badniks^H^H^H^H news itself.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   It would be pretty similar to the thesis about why the show is good; 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   it would explain why we want Sega to give permission back to DiC to make 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   StH episodes, and our willingness to fully support them if they do.  (If
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;   we need to write a 2nd letter, this will be slightly more threatening.)
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Here's where I have a problem; &quot;threats&quot; never work, especially when 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;they're idle ones; just _how_ would you &quot;threaten&quot; them?  There's nothing 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;to boycott, which is all they care about.  The only possible exception is 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;the video games, and let's face it, most fans of the show and/or comic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;either have already bought all the video games they're going to, or they 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;don't buy them in the first place (I'm in the latter category).
</em><br />
<br />Well, boycotts aren't the only way to annoy a company.  We could, for
<br />
example, start raising a stink in the press...maybe get the attention of
<br />
WiReD or something.  One of Rotor's (sirkay_at_usa.pipeline.com) friends has
<br />
this list of news sources that can be reached via the net.  Maybe we could
<br />
try to explain to them our plight, if the mail-in campaign doesn't work.
<br />
<br />Also, I was musing over the idea of putting our downloadable form letter on
<br />
a web page, and then get it as many links as physically possible (Yahoo, et
<br />
al).  Since several people around could do this, I was thinking of asking
<br />
around later after someone helps me write it up. 
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;So, whaddya think?  If we all work together on this, we could probably at
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev2">&gt;&gt;least make enough noise to make them notice us.  
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;I think that while it would be nice to have Sonic back, it would also be 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;nice to have new Tiny Toons too; given the current marketing/programming 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;situation, I don't expect to see either again.  All we can do is keep the 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;memories alive via the list, Usenet, and fan-fic, and/or move on to 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;whatever replaces them (unfortunately, none of the replacements (for Sonic 
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;_or_ TTA) are nearly as good).
</em><br />
<br />I disagree.  I think we've got an excellent opportunity now (being that StH
<br />
is currently lurking about on USA) to not only show that the program does
<br />
have a *residual* audience, but one that could be enlarged signifigantly. 
<br />
That's where we come in.  If we can attract enough people to the show now,
<br />
while the fire is hot, perhaps the new fans would be willing to help get
<br />
the show a 3rd season, or at least a mini-movie explaining what the hoo-hah
<br />
happened after Doomsday.     
<br />
<br />That's how I feel.  What's everyone else's stance on this?
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;RDB

<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--- That cyberpunk.
