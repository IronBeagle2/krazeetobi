<em class="quotelev1">&gt;system, has her healing rate and other bodily production and
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;replacement functions improved or depreciated?  Is she effectively
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;immortal now?  (Insert a thousand story ideas here. :)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point of roboticzation was to turn someone into a robot.  The systems
<br />
were not designed to cooperate with the organic parts of the body, they were
<br />
designed to completely replace them.  So, her body's immune system would stay
<br />
the same, but her limbs' immune system is now much better.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The organic part of her is not immortal, but the robotic part is.  (It was
<br />
never &quot;alive&quot; in the first place, though.)  If her head exploded, I'm sure
<br />
she'd die.  If her arm exploded, she could replace it.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;Do the limbs have their own power supply (feel free to guess wildly
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;what it could be) or do they draw power from the organics?  If the
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;limbs do have their own source of energy, can this be used to
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;replenish organic energy systems like the ATP/ADP cycle? (Rather
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;simple to do, if the nanites can handle the endocrines) ...so does
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;Bunnie need to eat?  (What /does/ she eat? :) How are wastes
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;taken care of? (Absorption by the nans, I'd think.  How else here
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;has read &quot;Blood Music&quot;, by Greg Bear? :)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something has to power the limbs.  But, as I said above, they weren't
<br />
designed to draw power from the organic parts of the body.  So, they must
<br />
have their own power supply.  The power could be used to replenish the
<br />
organic systems, but would have to be reconfigured somehow.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An arm and two legs isn't much power.  If their power is being used both
<br />
to walk and to give Bunnie energy, she isn't getting much energy.  So she
<br />
probably still has to eat something.  If her stomach and digestive system are
<br />
still organic, she can eat anything she normally would.  If not, (since Unlce
<br />
Chuck can eat a chili dog) there's some kind of stomach-thing that can store
<br />
food until it's used for energy.  After it's used, the waste could either be
<br />
excreted by normal means or taken away more subtly by the nanites.
<br />
<br /><em class="quotelev1">&gt;From the loads she's placed on it, I would say that her skeleton
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;(at least the spine, collar bones and hips) is probably all
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;synthetic now.  It would be most interesting to see an X-Ray of
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;her...  (Is she just like a Terminator with only a skin-deep cute
</em><br />
<em class="quotelev1">&gt;and fluffy exterior? :)
</em><br />
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably right.
