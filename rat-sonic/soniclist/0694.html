<br />
Part 3.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time went on, and the small band of refugees did the best they 
<br />
could to keep living.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 23 survivors began to pool their knowledge together, and 
<br />
slowly, a village was born.  The crude burrows they had slept in the 
<br />
first night became a complex system of underground rooms and hallways.  
<br />
They learned what plants could be used for food and medicine, and some 
<br />
of the people even had hunting skills.  The hovercar had had the 
<br />
incredible luck of crashing near a small brook, so water was available 
<br />
as well.  It was not the city life they had known, but it was one they 
<br />
could live.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hovercar's radio provided their only way of knowing what was 
<br />
going on.  The hovercar's batteries were soon dead, but luck continued 
<br />
to help them, as one of the group fashioned a hand-cranked generator out 
<br />
of parts from the hovercar.  By monitoring the Palace Guard and other 
<br />
radio frequencies that Jean had had access to, they learned what was
<br />
happening to Mobotropolis, and it chilled them to the bone.  Shirley
<br />
realized that she would never see Jean again, and her heart broke even
<br />
more.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the years went on, the refugees' life became routine.  They 
<br />
tried to live as normally as they could, but it was in perpetual fear of 
<br />
being found.  The slightest noise from above would send everyone 
<br />
scurrying underground, and nobody ever dared to venture far from the 
<br />
village.  Nobody, that is, except for an energetic, young fox.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse was the only child in the group, and he grew up quickly in 
<br />
the underground village.  His mother had been hesitant to tell him 
<br />
exactly what had happened, but finally, she did.  One night, when 
<br />
Tolouse was seven, she sat down with him and explained why they were 
<br />
living in the forest, why they were always hiding, and what she was sure 
<br />
had happened to Jean.  Tolouse had listened, asking no questions.  When 
<br />
she had left his room, he had crawled into bed, but sleep did not come 
<br />
until late in the night.  He thought about what his mother had told him, 
<br />
and then he thought about his life here and the fear that seemed to
<br />
dictate what to do.  Finally, just before sleep came, he became
<br />
determined to do something about it.  He didn't know how, but he would
<br />
find a way to help them.
<br />

<br />
* * *
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nearly nine years after their escape, Shirley and the others 
<br />
noticed that the transmissions they were picking up on the radio had 
<br />
taken on a new tone.  There was talk of a band of &quot;freedom fighters&quot; 
<br />
somewhere in the Great Forest who were apparently putting up a good 
<br />
fight for Robotnik.  Shirley could not see how such a thing was even 
<br />
feasible, but other villagers cheered the possibility of Robotnik being 
<br />
brought down, however remote that possibility was.  Some time after 
<br />
these new developments occurred, the transmissions ceased all together.  
<br />
It was reasoned that they were probably being scrambled now, to keep 
<br />
these &quot;freedom fighters&quot; from picking them up as well.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse, who was now 13, had heard about the transmissions, too.  
<br />
Almost immediately, he knew that this was his chance to help his mother 
<br />
and the villagers, the way he had wanted to do for six years now.  He 
<br />
wanted to find this place, this &quot;Knothole&quot; that was mentioned in the 
<br />
transmissions.  He wanted to see Robotnik pay for taking his father and 
<br />
making his mother fear for her life almost daily.  He wanted to be a 
<br />
freedom fighter.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You want to *what*?&quot; Shirley asked.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mother, everyday I look around here and I see us living like 
<br />
prisoners because of that...jerk, Robotnik.  I want to do something 
<br />
about it.  I want to find this Knothole place and help them fight him!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Tolouse, think!  Robotnik has taken over the entire civilization, 
<br />
on both continents!  Do you really believe that a small group of people 
<br />
can put up a war against somebody like that?  With all his robots and 
<br />
technology to back him up??&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse looked away in frustration.  &quot;But we're not even trying!  
<br />
You won't even let me walk out into the forest on my own.  I'm sick of 
<br />
just sitting here when something could be done about it.  Anything!&quot;  
<br />
Tolouse turned towards her.  &quot;Mother, I don't want to live like this!&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley looked at her son.  He was no longer the frightened baby 
<br />
she had fled Mobotropolis with, all those years ago.  A tear came to her 
<br />
eye.  &quot;How would you even know where to go?&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tolouse sighed.  &quot;I don't.  But the more I think about it, the more 
<br />
I want to at least try.  Please, Mother.&quot;  Tolouse looked into his 
<br />
mother's eyes.  &quot;I've got to try.&quot;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley knew that her son's mind was made up.  The tears came 
<br />
freely, now.  &quot;Okay, Tolouse.  Okay.&quot;  She hugged him as tightly as she 
<br />
could.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next day, before the Mobian sun had risen, he was gone.  He had 
<br />
packed some food and had said one last goodbye to his mother.  Then, 
<br />
looking out into the Great Forest, he began walking.
<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shirley spent most of the day in her room, crying.  She had lost 
<br />
her husband to the cruelty of Ivo Robotnik.  Now, she feared that she 
<br />
had lost her son as well.
<br />
