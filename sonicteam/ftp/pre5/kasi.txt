	In a dream I could see                               

	You are not far away                                    

	Anytime anyplace                                         

	I can see your face                                       

	You're that special one                  

	that I have been waiting for

	And I hope you're looking for someone like me

	In a dream we can do	

	everything we want to	

	There's no where I'd rather be

	but here with you	

	The stars above light the way	

	only for you and I	

	I'm so glad I've found the one	

	I've been looking for	

★Male

	Keep the dream 

	of the one you're hoping for 　

	Love can come 

	through an open door	　　　　　

	Just be strong 

	and you're sure

	to find 

	the one
