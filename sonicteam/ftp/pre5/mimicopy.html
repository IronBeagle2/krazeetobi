*Male
	In a dream I could see                                 
	You are not far away                                  
	Anytime anyplace                                         
	I can see your face                                       
	You're that special one                               
	that I have been waiting for
	And I hope you're looking for someone like me

*Female                                                    
	In my dreams 
	I can hear you calling me    
	In the night 
	everything's so sweet        
	In your eyes 
	I feel 
	there's so much inside     

*Both
	*)
	In the nights, dream delight 
	I want to see you standing there             
	In the nights, dream delight                       

	I've found someone who really cares      
	In the nights, dream delight                        
	I want to see you smile again                      
	In the nights, dream delight                       
	You're the one I've waited for  
         
*Female
	In a dream we can do	
	everything we want to	
	There's no where I'd rather be
	but here with you	
	The stars above light the way	
	only for you and I	
	I'm so glad I've found the one	
	I've been looking for	

*Male
	Keep the dream 
	of the one you're hoping for
	Love can come 
	thru an open door
	Just be strong 
	and you're sure
	to find 
	the one
