A fun baseball game that allows players to pitch, hit, defend, and run just as they would in a real game.

You can choose between two modes, USA and JPN, and two different types of teams, with a wide variety of unique players. Players can play against the computer in one-player mode, or against a friend in two-player mode. The game is a realistic, fast-paced baseball game that will have you in the palm of your hand as you begin to battle.
