YOSHI'S SAFARI
1993
SHOOTING

The 12 jewels, symbols of peace in Jewelry Land, have been stolen by Bowser and his minions. Asking for help from Princess Peach, Mario and Yoshi set out to recover the jewels... This 3D shooting game makes full use of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System's rotate and zoom functions. The player rides Yoshi and shoots down enemy characters that appear one after another using the Super Scope. As you progress through the varied courses on the beach and grasslands, you are already in Mario World.
