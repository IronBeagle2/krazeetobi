Sonic the Hedgehog
Sega / Release date undecided / Price undecided / Action

Could it be another Alex Kidd?
They are trying to create a new original character with this Sonic the Hedgehog. Please stay tuned for further details.

For release next Spring comes an original character action game from Sega.
We don't have details on what sort of game this will turn out to be but judging from screens it looks quite different from anything we've seen to date from Sega. We think the colorful and bright graphics could turn out to be popular.
It remains to be seen wheter this will turn into another Alex Kidd Osaaru for Sega!
