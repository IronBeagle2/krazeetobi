The first related CD is the best album of vocal songs from Sonic Team's past works!<br>
Although it is not mentioned on the cover or anywhere else, there is actually a secret track, Open Your Heart, the main theme of Sonic Adventure, on the 12th track.<br>
I miss now that in various places, Mr. Naka said, "We may be able to heart the future on step ahead..." I miss it now.<br>
<br>
Actually, the final recording of Open Your Heart was done in L.A. in mid-September 1998, so we were on a really tight schedule to get it on this CD.<br>
However, we had received many inquiries about the main theme from the Sonic team, so were very happy to be able to record it... I am very happy that we were able to record it.<br>
<br>
Still, when I listen to the past songs side by side like this, I feel I can get a new sense of the power and direction of the sound team these days.<br>
It truly lives up to its name as the best album!<br>

Since the details of the included songs have already been introduced on the Sonic Team page, which can be accessed from the top right corner of the page, I asked Mr. Makino, the head of the sound team, and other staff members who were involved in the sound sources included in this work to comment.<br>

I know this is old news, but back in the MEGA-CD days, we thought a lot about how to take CS Sound's production in the right direction.<br>
The big thing is that the media is now CD-ROM, but it also includes the coexistence with built-in sound sources, the significance of game music, etc....<br>
So, through a process of trial and error, a direction was found, and many very wonderful works were born.<br>
This album is one form of compilation of all of them.<br>
We want to keep making the best so that we can continue to release these best albums in the future!<br>

Some remixing has been done on this CD.<br>
The original image was not changed at all, but unused tracks were pulled out again, the balance between instruments was changed, tones were tweaked, and so on...<br>
I think that those who have had the opportunity to listen to the soundtrack and other details will enjoy the difference.<br>
Dreams Dreams ~Sweet Mix In Holy Night~ is composed of audio and sound effects used in the Christmas NiGHTS movie, interspersed with audio used in the music of the main NiGHTS film.<br>
This is also a treasure hunt for those who have sucked the software down to the bone.<br>

When I joined the company, Sonic CD was just approaching its busy period, and sometimes Mr. Ogata and Mr. Hatani would let me listen to their demos, and I would say, "Wow! You sound like a pro!" I thought, "Wow! " (Of course, everyone is a pro, but...)<br>
Those memorable songs, Dreams Dreams with the help of many people, and I just smile, which I am sorry for my poor singing, were combined into one CD....<br>
This is such a big deal that I never even dreamed of it back then when I didn't even know about MIDI or sequencers.<br>
I can't do anything on my own yet, but this will encourage me to learn more.<br>

When I heard about the Sonic Team Power Play album I was very excited.<br>  
I have played all of the Sonic games many times, and there is some fantastic music on these games.<br>
My personal favourite is Sonic CD!!<br>
In my opinion, Sonic Team create some of the best games, so it seemed like such a great idea to put together an album containing the best of the music.<br>
The album has much variety and many different styles, which represent each game very well.<br>
I was very honoured to have some music from Sonic R included in the album.<br>
I hope people will enjoy listening to it as much as I have.<br>
