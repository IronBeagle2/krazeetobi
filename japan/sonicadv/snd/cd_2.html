<!----------------------------A little commentary---------------------------->

<tr><td align="left" bgcolor="#ffff00">
<font size="2">
The second related CD is a mini-album featuring vocal tracks used in SONIC ADVENTURE!<br>
Since the CD was released prior to the game, many people must have been building up an image of the game with this CD until the game was released!<br>
<br>
These songs, which are based on "rock" but incorporate a variety of tastes, are full of "raw" quality.<br>
Tony Harnell of TNT, Johnny Gioeli formerly of HARDLINE, Ted Poley formerly of DANGER DANGER - BONEMACHINE, current rhythm section of LOUDNESS, renowned session bassist Will Lee, drummer for the Miles Davis Band Ricky Wellman... And so on.........<br>
We received high praise from various quarters on the music side. We are very grateful.<br>
<br>
The title of Songs With Attitude was inspired by the phrase "Dude With a'Tude", which was used as a catchphrase for Sonic overseas. Take not only your Chao but also your music CDs outside!<br>

This song takes advantage of Tony Harnell's vocal range.<br>
I wrote the song with him as the vocalist from the beginning.<br>
The studio where we mixed in L.A. was the venerable A&M Studio, and we were thrilled to have worked there.<br>
One thing I will never forget is that it was after 6 in the morning when I recorded the guitar solo, and I was exhausted! (Senoue)
<hr width=80%>
When I hear this intro, it is truly Sonic... In my mind.<br>
Tony's high, clear voice is pleasant. (Tokoi)

I really like Tony Harnell's voice.<br>
I can't get this song out of my head. (Kumatani)<br>

I didn't intend to write the song that way, but the lyrics, which were a bit naughty, struck a chord with the American people.<br>
In many ways, it is a "strong" song. (Kumatani)
<hr width=80%>
Nikki's voice is very cute, like Madonna's when she was young (laughs).<br>
But the adult singing style is also attractive, very attractive.<br>
The brass section's four verses are the best. (Tokoi)
<hr width=80%>
I was very impressed with Will Lee, who took advantage of the bass line I was playing when we made the pre-production in Japan!<br>
I remember when Kumatani called me excitedly during recording. (Senoue)<br>

The appointment of Ted Poley is a great decision!!!!<br>
The slide guitar and toy-heavy percussion give it a very nice flavor.<br>
It took me a long time to make this song because it has this kind of tune (laughs).<br>
Lyrics by Kumatani... Thank you! (Senoue)
<hr width=80%>
The way he sings the melody is a pro.<br>
Also, the drums on this song were a struggle.<br>
Ricky's eyes were so cute as he looked at Kosugi-san, who instructed him while dancing.<br>
But he was Miles Davis' drummer. (Tokoi)
<hr width=80%>
I will not forget. John Paris's Momiage!<br>
This song should have a stronger emotional attachment to me, but lately when I listen to it, all I can think of is momiage.<br>
But it's a fun song, so I'll go with Momiage. (Kumatani)

Are you sure? So... (Senoue)<br>

I was surprised at how many people liked this song.<br>
Of course, I like it myself, though!<br>
This song was in this state from the first demo, as I started working on it at night and it was ready in the morning.<br>
It's a personal attachment, and for me it's not Tails, it's Miles. (Senoue)
<hr width=80%>
If I had listened to this CD as a third party, I would have definitely put this song as No. 1...<br>
I like this song so much that I think it is my favorite song too.<br>
Don't you feel like this song is the only one that came from a different country? (Kumatani)
<hr width=80%>
I love Karen's singing voice.<br>
The freshness and sexiness tickle my maternal or paternal instinct (?). It tickles my motherly or paternal instinct (?). (Tokoi)<br>

This is the fourth song counting from the prototype, and it has changed quite a bit.<br>
It seems that the "badass" rap was very much in the news. (Tokoi)
<hr width=80%>
"Naknaknaknakkooz..." Everyone imitates this part.<br>
The rhythm that makes your body move naturally and the bass that licks around are very cool.<br>
It's like the composer himself. (Kumatani)
<hr width=80%>
Marlon Sanders is a continuation of the NiGHTS Acapella and Burning Rangers.<br>
It is true that the tune of the song might be like "Tokoikun" if you ask me....<br>
Oh, by the way, do you know what the "M.E." in the title stands for?<br>
It stand for "Master Emerald". (Senoue)<br>

This song was the main theme of the 9th song, but this song was not reworked 9 times, there were 9 different songs... That is to say, there were 9 different songs...<br>
Only the backing was done quickly, but I had a hard time with the melody and lyrics (rhymes and whatnot...).<br>
The guitar solo had not been included for a long time, but I added it at the end on a whim.<br>
The whine-whine at the end of the song is an electric screwdriver being played on a guitar. Can you believe it?<br>
Incidentally, we prepared a song sung by Tokoikun for the commercial for the production presentation, and a song sung by Sakamoto of ex.ANTHEM~ANIMETAL for the demo for downloading.<br>
I guess I recorded a lot of something....<br>
Recording with Johnny Gioeli was tough with a tight schedule, but it was perfect! (Senoue)
<hr width=80%>
Johnny is good.<br>
The chorus entry is quite difficult, yet easily... It is also sung in a very crisp and clear way.<br>
I think the finish is typical of the main theme. (Tokoi)
<hr width=80%>
This song really clearly deserves to be called the main theme.<br>
I was hooked by the keyword "COOL".<br>
But I know the many hardships involved in this song.<br>
Long live "Open Your Heart"! (Kumatani)<br>
