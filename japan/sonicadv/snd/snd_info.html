Her name is also on the staff roll of Sonic Adventure, but it wasn't just because they let us use the song from NiGHTS!<br>

Sorry for the delay!!!<br>

It would probably be best if I could go over to you all and play for you, but I can't deal with all that. (laughs)<br>
Unlike a real live performance, a karaoke communication system uses data to play the sound source, so of course there are differences, but we repeatedly asked them to improve the quality as much as possible.<br>
Thanks to Sega Music Networks and all those involved in the data production.<br>
It should be available soon and we will keep you posted!<br>

Thanks to your support, the Sonic Adventure-related music CDs seem to be well received.<br>

"CLUB SEGA" was released last year and has established a new movement in the club scene and has been on NTV's "Countdown Groove" show for over 4 months.<br>
As the title suggests, it is a club mix of SEGA's game sounds, and the second in the series, "CLUB SEGA 2 ~Beat Grooves~" has been released.<br>
For this album, I'm taking vocal songs with English lyrics as the subject matter and remixing them by dance music creators from all over the world.<br>
Since we're presenting it here, there's something about the Sonic team... I guess that's what I'm saying.<br>
In fact, songs like this one have been remixed.<br>

Literally, it's a magazine for people who enjoy DTM (desktop music), and in it is an interview about the sound of Sonic Adventure.<br>

But I still think that the tokoikun in this picture is not quite right....<br>

Also, this magazine has a serialized section called "Game Music Fan Club", where we pick up a song in each issue and create MIDI data for it.<br>
In the past, songs from NiGHTS and Sega Rally 2 have been featured, but this time, Open Your Heart is the subject of this project.<br>
