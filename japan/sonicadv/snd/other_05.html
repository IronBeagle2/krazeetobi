This is an arranged version of the Sonic CD that was planned long after the project was launched.<br>
Incidentally, the jacket, etc., was designed by Sonic Adventure's design chief, Mr. Hoshino.<br>
It came with a "round sticker" with the same Sonic as the jacket.<br>
I received a comment from Mr. Hatani regarding this CD, which I would like to share with you.<br>
<hr width=50%>
Sonic CD, for me, was a very memorable project.<br>
At the time, the office was located in the middle of nowhere at the Ota Market on Keihin Island, and the food was good (especially the sushi), but that was OK, because I was working in isolation and was almost living in the office.<br>
It was not until long after the release of the CD that Sonic CD, which was created with this in mind, was approached about a music CD.<br>
Because of the passage of time, we had many ideas about what kind of CD to make, but since it was right around the time that Sega had a studio, we ended up "reconstructing" and putting together the CD ourselves based on the original songs.<br>
Well, I would have to write a book about my feelings about each song and their close relation to the game, but it would take about 2,000 pages to explain it. (No kidding.)<br>
The music that Ogata and I were aiming for at that time to be played on "J-WAVE" was used in a program called Pazz and Jops, the ending of other programs, etc., and we were able to realize one small dream. (Ahem!)<br>
Oh, and there was originally a plan to have Sega's singing vocalist (as it were) Mitsuyoshi sing, but for various reasons, he had to be put off. Too bad...<br>
I even recorded a tentative song.<br>
Nostalgia for Sonic CD is captured in the sixth track, "Miracle Blue".<br>
This Blue is Sonic's Blue. (Hatani)<br>
