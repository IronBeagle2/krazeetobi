</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR=FFFFFF>
<H1>In the beginning there was NCSA Mosaic....</H1> 
<HR SIZE=3>



<H3>Version 0.1a</H3>
<I>Development began in June 1993 - Internal testing Only</I>
<UL>
<LI>Native support for accessing documents and data using World Wide Web,
    gopher, Anonymous FTP, and NNTP (Usenet News) protocols.  Support for
    archie, finger, whois, and Veronica (as well as others) through gateways.
<LI>Full HTML display
<LI>Support for inlined GIF images in HTML hypertext documents
<LI>Internal sound support for Sun/NeXT/DEC .AU audio files
<LI>Support for GIF, JPEG, MPEG, QuickTime for Windows, Microsoft Video for
    Windows, Postcript and other documents via forking to appropriate
    viewers (user configurable)
<LI>Full hypertext support, including using inlined images as anchors
<LI>Optional toolbar with shortcut buttons
<LI>Optional status bar to display hyperlink destinations
<LI>Local History
<LI>Fully customizable font selection
<LI>Savable preferences, including window size and position
<LI>Minimal Hotlist
<LI>Scrolling for large documents
<LI>Status of loading/decoding shown in status bar
</UL>


<H3>Version 0.2a</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed some memory leaks
<LI>Now works with Winsock 1.1 compliant DLLs
<LI>Local file support
<LI>User configurable hotlist
<LI>Ability to add current document to hotlist
</UL>


<H3>Version 0.3a</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed bug which would cause a GPF upon exiting
<LI>Fixed a number of memory holes which would lead to GPF's and quickly
    running out of available resources. (although some probably still 
    remain).
<LI>Binary Transfer Mode.
<LI>Support for Inlined X-Bitmaps
<LI>Configuration option to automatically load a home page.
<LI>User configurable menus
<LI>Internal support for AIFF audio files
<LI>Fixed bug which would cause a crash if an inlined image was missing
<LI>Fixed strange bug which resulted 'y with quotation mark' characters
<LI>Added ability to perform remote search (still has a bug...see below)  
</UL>


<H3>Version 0.4a</H3>
<UL>
<LI>Null chunk bug has been fixed!  You should no longer see Mosaic dropping
    parts of a document.
<LI>Problems with anchors on left edge of the window have been fixed.
<LI>GPF when choosing "Add Current to Hotlist" with no document loaded has been
    fixed.
<LI>Anchors in preformatted text now work correctly.
<LI>The new line break tag (&lt;BR&gt;) has been implemented.
<LI>Description lists display correctly.
<LI>Lists can now be nested to arbitrary depth.
<LI>The bold (&lt;B&gt;) and italics (&lt;I&gt;) tags now work.
<LI>We now try to load an image several times before we give up on it.  This
    is actually a little annoying on documents that have missing images (such
    as some of the Vatican Exhibit docs), but I'm working on fixing that.
<LI>Mosaic for Windows calls WSACleanup to clean up the sockets library.  This
    may temporarily cause a problem for people using our library - Windows
    will give the message "Application Error - Call to Undefined Dynalink" when
    you try to exit. Don't worry about it.  We'll get around to fixing it.
<LI>Lastly, the fix to the bug that was wiping out chunks of a document seems
    to have improved the GPF'ing.  However,  it still crashes every once in
    a while, and it still seems to be a much more frequent occurence in the
    non-debugging version of the program. *sigh*.
</UL>


<H3>Version 0.5a</H3>
<I>Released Sept. 16, 1993</I>
<UL>
<LI>Image cacheing within document - no more multiple loads of images
    when they are used multiple times in a document.
<LI><B>MUCH</B> faster scrolling, due to smarter drawing function. <I>This
    introduced an as-yet-unfixed redrawing bug while scrolling in a document
    that has inlined images.</I>
<LI>This seems to alleviated the problem with documents being visually
    mangled when loaded while not scrolled to the top.
<LI>Bug with removing spaces in Gopher, News, and FTP is fixed.
<LI>Internal anchors - i.e., hyperlinks to anchors within a document - work now, complete with
    scrolling to the correct location.
<LI>File Typing (i.e. HTML vs plaintext) is done more intelligently.
<LI>Home Page button and Menu option work now, loading whatever document is
    set up as "URL0" in WMOSAIC.INI.
<LI>Open Local capability - use standard file dialog to open files on local
    disk.
<LI>Drag and Drop local file capability
<LI>Drag and Drop file to annotation window
<LI>Image retry is smarter - knows when it failed to connect vs when server
    returned an error.
<LI>Find/Find Next (searching within a document)
<LI>The white strip that was showing up in the Fast and Error bitmaps when
    they were hyperlinks is gone.
<LI>Spaces are now stripped out at the beginning of list indices and
    paragraphs.
</UL>


<H3><A HREF="mos06.zip">Version 0.6b</A></H3>
<I>First beta release - September 28, 1993</I>
<UL>
<LI>Try out the brand-new "Mail to Developers" option under the Help menu!!
    This lets you send email to the developers straight from your PC.
    Be sure to set up your email address in WMOSAIC.INI.
<LI>The ISMAP image attribute is supported!!  For a demo of this, take a
    look at the <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/expo_map.html">
    Expo</A>.
<LI>History Window is now fixed - "Back" and "Forward" work correctly.
<LI>"Display Inlined Images" option is now complete - shut this off to
    not transfer inlined images (lots faster for people running over a
    slow net connection).  Press the left mouse button to traverse a
    hyperlink, press the right mouse button to load an unloaded inline
    image.
<LI>The new horizontal rule tag (&lt;HR&gt;) has been implemented.
<LI>Local directory browsing works now.  Try <a href="file:///c|/">this.</a>
<LI>The messed-up MPEG and JPEG extensions are fixed, and configureable.
<LI>Options for changing anchor color and <B>underlining anchors</B>.
<LI>Completely configureable MIME-style extension typing and presentation
    (See installation documentation for details.)
<LI>Drive specifiers have been added to local file URLs.
<LI>"DELETE : command not found" error after loading GIF, etc., is gone.
<LI>Personal Annotations are much more robust now.
<LI>Scrolling via keys is now supported.
<LI>ISO characters should work now, if specified by the correct HTML, like so:
    "Sein -- das ist der Pa&szlig; f&uuml;r die Ewigkeit." (aus <B>Die
    Gr&ouml;ssere Hoffnung</B> von Ilse Aichinger.)
</UL>


<H3><A HREF="mos07.zip">Version 0.7b</A></H3>
<I>Released October 17,1993</I>
<UL>
<LI>A MAJOR memory drain is plugged... you can now use Mosaic for a LOOOOOONG
    time without running out of memory (hopefully!).
<LI>DOCUMENT caching is now supported!  You can cache by number of documents
    (stable) or amount of memory (NOT stable).
<LI>The Search feature works again!
<LI>Windows Mosaic is now HTTP/1.0 compliant.
<LI>If HTTP accesses didn't work for you, but Gopher and FTP did, it should
    now. (This was the case running under Windows NT.)
<LI>Mail To Developers window now resizes correctly.
<LI>The SMTP/Mail host is now configureable.
<LI>The history is fixed - no more Assertion Failed messages from Back&Forward
    buttons.
<LI>WinMosaic no longer attempts to MIME-type files transferred in binary mode.
<LI>URLs which contain IP numbers no longer cause GPFs.
<LI>Documents without titles no longer have the last document's title in the
    title bar.
<LI>The background color can be set to white instead of grey.
<LI>The underlining/anchor bug seen on the Mosaic demo page is fixed.
<LI>The problem with menu items on Menu 8 being mapped to Menu 2 is fixed.
<LI>Temporary file names are chosen more intelligently (attempts to use the
    source file's name.)
</UL>


<P>
<H3><A HREF="mos10.zip">Version 1.0</A></H3> <i>Released Nov 11, 1993</i>

<UL>
<LI>The scrolling bug is fixed.   You shouldn't see the screen mess up due
    to images or large text in the document anymore.
<LI>Network I/O is now (somewhat) <B>interruptable</B>.  Click on the big
    Mosaic icon in the upper-right corner to kill a net transfer.
<LI>Also, quitting Mosaic forces a kill of any net transfers in progress.
    This means the "Can't run two instances of the same program" error message
    shouldn't appear anymore (although this feature is still a bit buggy.)
<LI>Images can now be alligned middle, top, or bottom, instead of just top.
    Considering that the default is bottom, and we only did top before, I
    was pretty surprised that no-one mentioned this anomaly throughout all
    our beta testing.
<LI>News articles are now readable (i.e., not all on one line.)
<LI>URL redirection (a feature of HTTP 1.0) is now supported.
<LI>Home Page loading is fixed.
<LI>If you were having problems with the first document you tried never
    loading, but subsequent ones working fine, that's fixed.
<LI>Title and URL boxes are redrawn at the correct time now.
<LI>Back & Forward Assertion Failed errors are gone.
<LI>Telnet executable (used for telnet:// URLs) is now configureable - see
    "telnet=" under the Viewers section of the INI file.
<LI>FTP error messages are now returned to the user.
<LI>FTP logins now use your email address when logging in (this fixes a
    connect problem the CERN LibWWW was creating.
<LI>You can log in to a NON-anonymous FTP via the following method: set the
    URL to be FILE://username@machine/pathname.  For example, to log in
    as user "jdoe" to FTP site "ftp.yoyodyne.com", in the "/usr/jdoe"
    directory, give the URL:
        "file://jdoe@ftp.yoyodyne.com/usr/jdoe"
    Mosaic will pop up a dialog box, asking to confirm the username and
    give your password.  <B>Your password is maintained within Mosaic
    until you quit. Do <I>NOT</I> use this feature if you are
    security-paranoid.</B>
<LI>Gopher and FTP now use pretty icons for files/directories/etc, and FTP
    shows the file sizes.
<LI>New set of Configured Menus, with all kinds of pointers.
<LI>Horizontal rules are prettier now.
</ul>


<H3><A HREF="mos20a1.zip">Version 2.0alpha1</A></H3> <I>Released Jan 31, 1994</I>
<UL>
<LI>HTML+ Forms are now supported!  This is not quite finished, but
        definitely well into the useful stage.
<dd>- Nasty problem with local file support fixed.
<LI> There is now an environment variable for the location of the
MOSAIC.INI file.  To use this, put a line like the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:
<PRE>                SET MOSAIC.INI=C:\MISC\MY_MOS.INI</PRE>
<LI> XBMs are now written as 1 bit bitmaps.  This means Mosaic
        now works in 24-bit and 16-bit video modes.
<LI> Better error reporting (explanatory text instead of numbers.)
<LI> Cursor now behaves itself - hourglass cursor only appears
during transfers when cursor is in window, and doesn't flash.
<LI> Horizontal rules no longer disappear.
<LI> URL/Title text overwriting boxes now fixed.
<LI> FTP is now much more stable.
<LI> Anchors in "pre" formatted text bug fixed.
<LI> Mosaic now supports a command-line parameter for URLs and
        local files (it discriminates between a pathname like
        C:\TMP\TEST.HTML and a URL like file:///C|/TMP/TEST.HTML.)
<LI> Inlined images are now cached across documents - if an image is
        in a previous document, it won't be reloaded from the net.
<LI> Blank lines in "pre" formatted text now appear correctly.
<LI> Occasional blank white (! Not grey!) chunks fixed.
<LI> Changing font forces a redraw.
<LI> GDI Resource leaks plugged.
<LI> disappearing text blocks bug fixed.

</UL>


<H3><A HREF="mos20a4.zip">Version 2.0alpha4</A></H3> <I>Released April 14, 1994</I>
Bugs Fixed:
<UL>
<LI> News:URLs.
<LI> underline anchor. 
<LI> resizing w/o a file. 
<LI> Scrolling ISINDEX docs.
<LI> Updating problems of the NCSA icon.
<LI> The problem with view source on cached docs.
<LI> The lost slash bug (the Temp files under Win31.)
</UL>


<H3><A HREF="mos20a5">Version 2.0alpha5</A></H3><I>Released June 24, 1994</I>
Bugs Fixed
<UL>
<LI> There were two large memory leaks which occurred whenever an
     inline image was decoded and displayed. These leaks were approx.
     1,000 bytes each.
<LI> The document view window was being drawn incorrectly whenever the user 
    was at the bottom of a document, and Mosaic was re-sized.
<LI> XBM images are now properly read and do not result in an ERROR graphic.
<LI> XBM images used to require a LARGE amount of time to decode. The
     code was re-written and now .xbm's decode approximately 100 times faster.
<LI> The Printing bugs; large files, images, bold text, .txt files.
<LI> Some minor problems with dialog boxes were fixed.
<LI> The CRASH caused by incorrect HTML, &lt dt &gt and &lt dd &gt tags without the &lt dl &gt tag,
     was corrected. Mosaic is a little more forgiving, but not much.  ;^)
<LI> The navigate back should now take you back to the last document viewed.
     Previously, Mosaic did not update the history when users accessed
     documents that were cached.
</UL>
Enhancements
<UL>
<LI> It is now possible to enter a URL directly to the Document URL line.
     Select the Document URL line, enter the URL and press return to open the 
desired URL.
<LI> The Vertical Scroll Bar is currently a permanent fixture on the
     document view window. This eliminates an extra screen redraw which would
     occur whenever the user went from a short document (less than one screenful)
     to a long document or vice versa. Ideally we'd like the vertical scroll bar     
	 to be dynamic without the extra redraws, but this will improve things for now.
<LI> The buttons on the button bar are now in color.
<LI> The "FIND" button was redrawn with a more intuitive picture. It used to
     look like a thermometer and may have lead people to believe it was for
     the hotlist.
</UL>


<H3><A HREF="mos20a6.zip">Version 2.0alpha 6</A></H3><I>Released July 27, 1994</I>
Bug Fixes
<UL>
<LI> This latest release has focused on speed and memory issues. Our next release, alpha 7,
will address many of the bugs which you have reported to us.  The following bugs have
been fixed in alpha 6:
<LI> The loading of local URLs should no longer produce DNS Lookup failures.
<LI> The loading of local images and sound files no longer deletes the file.
<LI> The loading of images now shows the transfer progress.
</UL>

<H3><A HREF="mos20a7.zip">Version 2.0 alpha 7</A></H3><I>Released Sep 7, 1994</I>
Bug Fixes
<UL>
<LI> Local files are no longer deleted.
<LI> Local files are no longer duplicated.
<LI> file:// = ftp://  (Alpha 6 locked file:// for local files and ftp:// for remote files.  However,
due to the large number of existing files that were written using the old definition of
file://, we had to revert back to file:// = ftp://.  Thus, file:///c| MUST be used to access
local files.)
<LI> Image alignment problem.  Inline images align horizontally.
<LI> The -i option was fixed.  (-i allows the user to use the mosaic.ini that is explicitly
defined.  ie.  mosaic.exe -i c:\ncsa\mosaic.ini)
</UL>
Added Features
<UL>
<LI> The save, save as function.  Save and Save as will save the current document to your local disk.
<LI> Animated Icon Change.  We've changed the size of the icon to be relative to the amount of
space that is available in the window.   ie.  If you use both the tool bar and the Show Current URL
functions,  you will have a full-size animated icon.   If you choose not to use either of these
functions, the icon will be reduced in size to fit in the available space.
<LI> Tool tips were added.  Tool tips offers the user information about the current tool the mouse
cursor is pointing at in the Tool bar.
<LI> The find icon on the Tool bar has changed from the list icon to a binocular icon.
<LI> We've removed the "URL" title from the "Show Current URL"
