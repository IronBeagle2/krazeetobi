Welcome to <b>Wham Bam Strawberry Jam!</b> - the rhyme, rhythm and lots of 
laughs show.

<BR><BR>

<b>Rik Mayall</b> stars in the series - - he's performing lots of 
well-known poems like Roald Dahl&#39;s &#34;Cinderella&#34; and A.A. Milne's 
&#34;The King&#39;s Breakfast&#34;.

<BR><BR>

Poets from Scotland, Manchester, Shropshire, Yorkshire and London will join 
children from each area, to find out about Yuk Love, School Secrets, Trees 
that Don&#39;t Go to School, Heroines and Heroes and Friendship.

<B>Rik Mayall</B> performs Gordon Snell&#39;s <b>&#34;The King of Quizzical 
Island&#34;</b> which is all about a King setting off to find the edge of 
the world and discovering he's returned to his own back door.

<BR><BR>

Meanwhile poet <b>Lemn Sissay</b> appears as a magical character called 
<b>&#34;Whoamiiiiii&#34;</b> who only becomes visible when his name is 
called three times.

<BR><BR>

He pops up to help a group of children from <b>Manchester</b> work out just 
exactly who they are - which happens to be, just like you - brill!

<BR><BR>

The programme was filmed in a fantastic maze at <b>Chatsworth House</b>, in 
Derbyshire. The Gardens are open every day from the 19th March to the 2nd 
November, from 11.00 to 17.00 and there's an entrance fee.

<B>Rik Mayall</b> performs Roger McGough&#39;s <b>&#34;Noah's Ark&#34;</b> 
- an up to date version of the story of Noah, and the animals which go into 
the ark two by two - along with Mrs. Noah and the rest of the family.

<BR><BR> 

<b>Paul Cookson</b> and <b>David Harmer</b> who are better known as 
<b>&#34;Spill the Beans&#34;</b>, do just that and let us in on all the 
secrets of life at school. There's the disgusting untidiness of the 
staffroom and the revolting habits of some teachers, but the pupils also 
have secrets of their own to be revealed!
