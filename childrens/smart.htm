<IMG SRC="./images/smarpres.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT">The next series of the 
fun art programme <b>SMart</b> will be returning to 
<b>Children's BBC</b> in September. <b>Mark Speight, Jay Burridge</B> 
and <B>Josie d'Arby</b> will be back together again with more great 
ideas and things for you to make using simple materials, and showing 
original ideas to help with your artwork. And each week there will be 
a Fact Sheet giving more information about the items.

<BR><BR>

They would also like to <A HREF="#ADDRESS">hear</A> from you because 
each week there are ways for you and your art to be included in the 
programme.

<BR><BR>

<b>The Gallery.</b> 

<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">
Each week we show a selection of artwork sent to the programme by 
viewers, aged up to 15 years. They can be paintings or drawn pictures, 
cut-outs or collages, 3-D items or computer graphics - as long as they 
are your own, original work. 

<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="5">
<b>SMart Tips.</b> 

<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">If you are having trouble with your art - want to 
know how to draw eyes, or give a  convincing shadow effect -  then ask 
our Agony Artists!  Each week they hold their <b>SMaster Class</b> on 
the programme, and it could be your question they answer.

<BR><BR>

<FONT SIZE="5">
<b>Competitions.</b> 

<BR>

<FONT SIZE="4">Throughout the series there will be competitions 
with fabulous prizes, to give another chance for you to use your design 
and art skills.
