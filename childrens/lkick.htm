<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/zoejami2.jpg">Well, are you missing us yet? 
It's only been a few weeks since we finished the series and we thought we 
would remind you of some of the highlights.

<BR><BR>

We were part of the <b>Spice Girls</b> invasion from the beginning and the 
girls have been on the show <b>3</b> times but the highlight had to be when 
our <A HREF="./stars.htm#Jamie"><B>Jamie</B></A> asked <b>Geri Spice</b> out. 
She said no and as far as we know things haven't changed. Other guests who 
made multiple appearances on the show are <b>Boyzone</b> (4 times), <b>Ant 
and Dec</b> and <b>911</b> (3 times) and <b>Paul Nicholls</b> who came on 
twice! We are just so popular, they couldn't stay away. But you must have 
had your favourite so why not let us know who you liked and maybe we could 
get them on next series! 

<BR><BR>

The studio was full to bursting every week and the Hot Seat proved a bit of 
a challenge to some! <b>Lennox Lewis,</b> Heavyweight Champion of the World 
was floored when asked if he was going to settle down and have children, 
<b>Betty Boothroyd,</b> Speaker of the House of Commons and <b>Paul Burger,</b> 
Chairman of Sony Music both agreed that they would like to see more women in 
business, <b>Sean Blowers</b> came in to tell us about his Round The World 
yacht trip and rang in to chat to mates <b>Robson and Jerome</b> a few weeks 
later as he neared Australia; and <b>Alan Shearer</b> wants to get his 
Geordie accent back!!

<BR><BR>

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="./images/lepre3.jpg">
People do some strange things when they come on to <B>Live &#38; Kicking!</B> 
egged on by resident funsters, <b>Trev and Simon</b> and <b>The Leprechauns.</b> 
<b>Sting and Jimmy Nail</b> became art critics, the <b>Sweet Valley High</b> 
twins ended up dressed up as Scottish Highlanders and 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Jamie"><B>Jamie</B></A> and 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Zoe"><B>Z&ouml;e</B></A> even got dressed up as bunnies. 
And all those video Grand Prix's!!!!! But who could forget Boyzone dressed 
up as the Spice Girls for our wannabes slot!!

<BR><BR>

<b>Cloud Nine</b> was a huge success with dreams coming true for loads of 
viewers, with a little help from <b>The Royal Ballet, Ryan Giggs,</b> a 
group of <b>Butlins Red Coats</b> and a monkey rescue centre, among others. 
If you have a dream, get your letters in now for the next series.  

<BR><BR>

And when does the new series start? Well, get your diaries and calenders 
ready or programme your electronic organiser with this date. 
<B>Live &#38; Kicking!</B> will be back on the air on
