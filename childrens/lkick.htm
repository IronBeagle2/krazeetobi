<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/zoejami2.jpg"> <FONT SIZE="5">Phew, what a superb second show! </FONT>  We're really, really, back now.  A fast and exciting show it most definitely was and if you slept in or weren't around at the right time (tut, tut - set your  alarm ready for next week, <B>now</B>). Here's a taster of the morning's best action that you may have missed out on….
<BR>

The show went on-air without <B>Zoe & Jamie</B> and the rest of the crew realising!  Even the lively audience did not manage to alert the team that it was 9.15am!  <B>The Men in Trousers</B> were back in the studio, with their zany sketches and brought another excellent insight to a rather unusual, School Staff Room.



<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="5">
The newest boyband, <B>Catch</B></FONT> (backed by the Spice Girls producers) set the programme off to a great start with their debut single called, 'Bingo'.  They sang live on Live & Kicking's new revolving stage (oooh!)  Did you know it's only 18 months since the band met, little did they imagine they would be hitting the big time in the pop world.  Dreams can come true,  especially in Cloud 9, this week Zoe surprised 13 year-old Clare from Kettering and told her she is going to be looking after 3 baby elephants at Woburn Safari Park.
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="5">Top girl soul singers, <B>Eternal</B></FONT> sang their latest hit, 'Angel of Mine' and callers queued up to put their questions to the girls.  Kelle, Esther and Vernie confirmed that they are not splitting up and are looking forward to making their 4th album. Kelly talked about how she used to sing endlessly at home and  how, even though she travels the world, she still gets home-sick and misses England, aah.
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="5"><B>Ben Unwin</B></FONT> who plays Jesse McGregor in, 'Home and Away' joined us for some action in the studio; encountering the Leprechaun's humour; answering questions about his life on and off tv and joining in the excellent video review, Hit, Miss or Maybe.  In his interview, Ben said that the only storyline he could really relate to was being dumped several times!  He also told us his favourite episode was where he rescued his daughter Rachel from the crocodiles, apparently the croc was the same one that featured in the movie, 'Babe'!
<BR><BR>
<FONT SIZE="5">Our Hot Seat guest this week was <B>Phil Redmond</B> </FONT>creator of top programmes and soaps such as Grange Hill, Brookside and Hollyoaks.  Phil recommended that all budding writers should: "just get writing and write what you believe in".  He, sadly, gave no future storylines away, however, he did confirm that rumours about Barry Grant's return to Brookside are true.
<BR>
If you missed it you missed out but plan for next week, and here's a preview to what's  happening from 9.15am on Saturday…
