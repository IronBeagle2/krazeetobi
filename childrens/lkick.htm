<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/lkromana.jpg">Ship ahoy me silicone sailors! 
It was all hands on deck last week as the 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/"><B>Blue Peter</B></A> ship sailed into the 
studio. In fact we nearly had a mutiny on our hands as 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/romana.html"><B>Romana</B></A> and 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/stuart.html"><B>Stuart</B></A> attempted to take over 
the whole show. Oh well, that's celebrity guests for you - give 'em an 
inch...... Simon the camerman kicked things off with one of your letters 
and his timing was better than Big Ben. Better watch your back 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Jamie"><B>Jamie.</B></A> Vote now! Yes it was your 
chance to exercise your democratic rights last week when we asked you to 
decide whether <b>Human Nature</b> were a hit or a miss - talk about rock 
the vote! The boys romped home with a landslide <b>90&#37;</b> in favour - 
we know how to put the kicking in <B>Live &#38; Kicking!</B>

<BR><BR>

Yee haw! Forget about those pesky puppet varmints good ole boy 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Jamie"><B>Jamie Theakston</B></A> got in line for a 
little wild west country dancing. The girls voted him one hot steppin papa 
but he did slip them a few bucks to say it....

<BR><BR>

Next up it was time to hoist the mainsail and shiver yer timbers as the 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/"><B>Blue Peter</B></A> theme tune rang out for 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/romana.html"><B>Romana</B></A> and 
<A HREF="/blue_peter/stuart.html"><B>Stuart</B></A> taking your questions.  
We think they deserve a gold badge for effort especially as they eat their 
own cooking. And talking of efforts, puff, gasp, wheeze it was Blob-mania 
at the <b>Blobby Marathon</b> with some pavement pounding outside Television 
Centre. Sadly our hero fell flat on his face and proceeded to run the wrong 
way, Liz McCoglan can rest easy.

<BR><BR>

Far more gracefully <b>Joanna</b> from Manchester had a heavenly experience 
last week when <B>Live &#38; Kicking!</B> lifted her up to a Cloud 9 to 
meet <b>Darcey Bushell</b> at the Royal Ballet. Joanne was thrilled - a 
case of the Cor! d'ballet......

a limited edition Star Wars Monopoly and a Millenium Falcon, then use the 
Force to <A HREF="WRITE">answer</A> this:

chance to meet Mickey and all his friends <b>IN PERSON.</b> We're giving a 
trip to <b>Disneyland Paris.</b>  Just <A HREF="WRITE">tell</A> us: 

<BR><BR>

<I>what is the name of Disney's famous flying elephant?</I>

<BR><BR>

The <b>Electric Circus</b> fab freebie this week has also been to the movies 
with goodies from Goldeneye, Babe, Toy Story and a signed basketball from 
Whoopi Goldberg's new movie Eddie.  All you have to do is 
<A HREF="WRITE">tell</A> us:

<BR><BR>

<i>How many players are there on a basketball team?</i>

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="WRITE">Send</A> all your answers on a postcard to the usual 
<B>Live &#38; Kicking!</B> snail mail address!

<BR><BR>

Calm Down! We said Calm Down! Pure pandemonium by the music stage as Britpop 
joker of the pack <b>Robbie Williams</b> blasted &#34;Old Before I Die&#34; 
loud enough for his fans crammed around the gate to hear. Robbie answered 
your questions and told us all about his Golden Boot as player of the year. 
He can certainly play for us anytime!  Apparently he's writing a song a day 
so there should be no shortage of Robbie mania for some time to come.

<BR><BR>

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="./images/lkalbert.jpg">Meanwhile we were moving on to the shinanigans in the Square as the Hot Seat 
was shared between scriptwriter <b>Tony McHale</b> and actors <b>Todd 
Carty</b> and <b>Caroline Pattison.</b> They got lots of questions 
especially Tony since everybody wanted to know what was due to happen in the 
future. But Tony managed to be very interesting without giving away any 
trade secrets, you'll just have to tune in to find out what the future holds.  
Tony even gave us some top tips on becoming a Square screenwriter - and we 
certainly think he's got the <i>write stuff!</i>

<CENTER><b>BACKSTAGE PASS</B></CENTER>

1.	Just Williams! It was all about Robbie backstage last week and our 
first juicy snippet will shock you. Apparently the lad from Stoke is a real 
mummy's boy!  Mrs Williams was deep in a motherly chat with Mrs Ball in much 
head shaking, kids today eh ladies.....

<BR><BR>

2.	Well if they were keeping mum the throng of screaming girlies 
outside the gate certainly weren't. BBC Television Centre got noise 
complaints from neighbours about Robbie's rabble.

<BR><BR>

3.	And there's more poptastic millions are apparently not enough to 
stop rascally Robbie pinching our Shona Ana's single &#34;You Might Need 
Somebody&#34; to look after the cds.

<BR><BR>

Make sure you tune in next week for our last show of the series when we'll 
be bringing you our second installment of our Take That whammy when we have 
<b>Gary Barlow</b> in the Hot Seat. <b>Michelle Gayle, Ant & Dec, 911</b> 
plus lots of other top celebrities join us for our end of series party.
