<B>Newsround</B> was the world's first news bulletin for children. It was an 

experiment to start with, but children liked it so much we never stopped! 

Next April we'll be celebrating our Silver Jubilee!



<BR><BR>



For seventeen years it was called <B>John Craven's Newsround</B>, after the 

man who presented it all that time. He was absolutely brilliant at making 

boring news interesting.

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/julietch.jpg"><B>Newsround</B> tries to do 

2 things - to cover stories of interest to children that probably won't be 

seen on any other news bulletin, and to pick out the important main news 

stories of the day and explain properly why they're happening and what they 

mean. There's always background information to make things clearer.

We get a lot of help from BBC News - they let us use their film and give

us information. We're connected to the same news gathering computers as them 

so we know exactly what's going on in the world all the time, and we operate 

just like any other television news room - only smaller! BBC News also let 

us use their editing rooms and camera crews, and we share our studio with 

<B>Newsnight</B> because they don't need it until late at night.



<BR><BR>



Every January we begin a series of <B>Newsround Extra</B> which is shown on 

Friday's instead of the normal news bulletin. It's a chance to look at a 

topical story in more detail and is usually a mixture of issues in this 

country and abroad. It's only a few weeks away now, and alreadt we're planning 

films about illegal logging in Brazil and bullying at school.



<BR><BR>



We've also started putting together our <B>Review of the Year</B>, even 

though the year hasn't finished yet! It's a huge job, looking back at 

everything we've done since January, and it's even harder deciding what the 

most important stories were and what to leave out. It's a special half hour 

programme that's shown just before the New Year - so don't forget to watch!
