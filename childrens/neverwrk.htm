<B>it'll never work</B> - the award-winning science show with a difference -

will soon be back on air for a brilliant brand new series!  

<BR><BR>Top team <B>Jez Nelson</B>, <B>Sally Gray</B> and <B>Angela Lamont</B>

have been all over the world to find the best stories ever!  And the craziest,

too!   

<BR><BR>Ever seen a kangaroo exercising on a treadmill?  Ever heard of a

battery powered by urine?  Ever thought of going on holiday to an underwater

hotel? 

<BR><BR>You can see them all on <B>it'll never work</B>! 

<BR><BR> And this year Kenji Kawakami of Japan - Useless Inventor

Extraordinaire and President of the Chindogu Useless Invention Academy - makes a

special trip to visit <B>it'll never work</B>.  Jez finds some strange

contraptions in his luggage! 

<BR><BR>Inspired by more of his mad ideas we'll be running another <B>useless

invention</B> competition - your big chance to see <B>your</B> design on telly!

 The idea?  To come up with an invention for something that could be very useful

but just <B>isn't</B>!  For more details of what to do and where to send your

entries watch this space...  and the programme! 

<BR><BR><B>it'll never work - Tuesdays, 4.35pm, CBBC.  Starting November

12th.</B> 

<BR><BR><B>Bookmark</B> this page now so you can keep coming back for more! 

There'll be quizzes, presenter factfiles and more wild ideas than you ever

imagined possible! 

<BR><BR>Be there! It's just too good to miss!
