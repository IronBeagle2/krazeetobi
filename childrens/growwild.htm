<P>Popular wildlife expert <B>Terry Nutkins</B>  takes a look at the

fascinating  world of young animals in <B>Growing Up Wild</B>, showing again on

weekday mornings on BBC2 during the autumn.

<BR><BR> Each week Terry, who recently featured in <B>&quot;Pets Win Prizes&quot;</B>,

introduces a different group of animals, through intriguing themes such as

'Danger', 'Tentacles and Toes' and 'Colourful markings' and looks at how animals

prepare their young for growing up in the wild. 

<BR><BR>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/terry.jpg"><B>Terry</B>

travels the length and breadth of the British Isles and beyond in search of

amazing animals - from the seabird colonies of  St Kilda to a lemur paradise on

Jersey.  

<BR><BR>In Florida Bay, <B>Terry</B> journeys out to the reptile-infested

mangrove swamps to see nesting crocodiles and ends up having a rather too close

encounter with a fully-grown alligator.  At Miami Airport he joins the K-9 Unit

of the US Customs - the Miami sniffer dog unit. 

<BR><BR>In other programmes <B>Terry</B> sings a hilarious operatic duet with

a parrot, meets a pair of giant South American otters who have made

Chapel-en-le-Frith their home from home, and finds the first baby wild boar to

be born in the New Forest for over a hundred years. 

<BR><BR>Also there is <B>'Tel's Tales'</B>  featuring amazing stories about

animals, including a 19th Century snake catcher called Brusher Mills,  and the

adventures of a ferret who &quot;saved the day&quot; during the Queen's Silver

Jubilee. 

<BR><BR>&quot;Of all the wild and exotic places I've travelled to over the

years&quot; says <B>Terry</B>,  &quot;my greatest moment as a naturalist thanks

to Growing Up Wild was to fly to the remote island of St Kilda in the North

Atlantic, which was evacuated in the 1930s and is now home for one of the best

colonies of seabirds anywhere in the world. Imagine the thrill of seeing  over

one hundred thousand gannets!&quot;
