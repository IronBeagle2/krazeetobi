We receive sackfuls of post every day, but we promise that every single picture or letter is opened and read - even if we can't always show them on air.

If you want to send a birthday card in for our <B>Playdays</B> slot please
remember to put the correct date on it (you'd be surprised how many people
forget!).  We get many, many cards sent in so it is impossible to ever read them
all out - and we're sorry but we can't return your cards either.</P>
