<A NAME="Janice"><B>JANICE ACQUAH</B> was born in <B>Accra, Ghana,</B> and 
grew up in the midst of a garden full of rescued stray animals - from 
puppies and kittens to a nest of pied crows.

<BR><BR>

After graduating from <B>York University</B> with a degree in Environment 
Biology and Education, she co-founded <B>Sparks Theatre Company</B> which 
devised shows on environmental and social issues. Work included projects 
and performances for Oxfam, CAFOD and Christian Aid in schools and 
community centres, allowing young people to explore their responses to 
these topics.

<BR><BR>

Janice has since been a presenter on the BBC’s <b>Wildbunch</B> and 
<B>The Really Wild Guide to Britain</B>. She also works as an actress and 
has made several appearances on <B>Emmerdale</B> (YTV).

<BR><BR>

An active environmentalist, Janice is a co-ordinator of her local <B>Friends 
of the Earth</B> group and cycles as much as possible in London.

<A NAME="Nick"><B>NICK BAKER</B> has been a presenter on 
<A HREF="./trws.htm"><B>The Really Wild Show</B></A> for two years now. He 
recently co-presented BBC-2’s <b>Watch Out</b> with Simon King and presented 
HTV’s <b>West Watch</b> with David Bellamy. Nick also appeared in <b>Nature 
Detectives</b>, <b>The Really Wild Guide to Britain</b> and <b>Playdays</b>. 
He is a regular contributor to Radio 4’s <b>The Natural History Programme</b> 
and writes for the <b>BBC Wildlife Magazine, Wildlife Watch,</b> and his 
local newspaper.

<BR><BR>

Nick lives in the aptly named &#34;Frog Cottage&#34; on Dartmoor along with 
a growing menagerie of small animals including <b>spiders, scorpions, stick 
insects, amphibians, reptiles, butterflies and moths.</b>  He keeps <b>pet 
leeches</b> in the fridge at home and often feeds them by attaching them to 
his leg! Among his favourites are Michael the <b>South American cane toad</b> 
nd a collection of hissing <b>cockroaches.</b>

<BR><BR>

Nick graduated from <b>Exeter University</b> in 1993 with a degree in 
biological sciences, but has been a keen naturalist from an early age. He 
co-founded Exeter University’s national <b>Bug Club</b> and was a member of 
the Royal Entomological Society’s Youth Development Committee.

<BR><BR>

As a field naturalist, he has been involved in research into the high 
brown <b>Fritillary butterfly</b> on Dartmoor and with <b>badgers,</b> also 
in Devon. He regularly tours schools with his animals to educate school 
children and often works with the <b>RSPB.</b>

<BR><BR>

But his talents are not limited to natural history. Nick also manages to 
fit in competitive cycling, and as a self-taught harmonica player, 
percussionist and singer, he regularly performs in jazz and blues bands.

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/richard.gif">Hello!

<BR><BR>

I hope you're enjoying reading our web pages, and now it's time for a bit of 
information about me! I was born on 12th August 1976, in Sheffield, where I 
lived with my Mum, Dad, and older brother James...who's a bit of an 
entertainer, (and has much brighter hair!)

<BR><BR>

I went to Tapton school in Sheffield and gained enough GCSEs to move to 
college to study media. I was always a bit of a chatterbox at school, and I 
think the teachers knew from an early age that I may end up doing a job 
where I talk a lot.

<BR><BR>

I always used to send letters to TV stations, asking them for stickers, 
photos, in fact anything I could stick up on my bedroom wall. It ended up 
looking like a studio!

<BR><BR>

At the age of 12, I joined a children's hospital radio station, where I 
learnt the basics of presenting. It was great, and I stayed there eight 
years! 

<BR><BR>

My next audience were people eating pizza and hamburgers! I got a 
job fronting a live Children's show TV in a Shopping Mall food court. Yes, 
there are even TV stations in shopping malls. It was very handy, because 
during the videos, I could go and do the shopping! 

<BR><BR>

After a couple of years, I started to send out demo tapes to lots of TV 
stations and programmes. Nothing much happened, and then I got an audition 
at Children's BBC. Somehow, I managed to convince them that I would make a 
good presenter, and here I am, (although between you and me, I still have 
not got a clue what I am doing!)

<BR><BR>

Luckily my mum watches, and gives me top tips, like ' Iron that shirt...it's 
all creased!' and 'get some more sleep...you look tired'.

<BR><BR>

In my spare time I like to socialise, listen to music, and I also like to 
buy clothes (I buy too many shirts!)

<BR><BR>

So that's me...
<BR><BR>

Keep watching, 
<BR><BR>

love Ricardo (that's what they call me in the office!)
<BR>

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" SRC="./images/kirsten.gif"><B>
<A NAME="Kirsten">Kirsten O'Brien</A></B> was born on the 23rd February 
1972, the product of a Norwegian Mum and a Dad from exotic Thornaby-on-Tees. 
Seconds after her birth she was whisked abroad for a life of sun, sea and 
schooling. (Actually it was about two years later, but we're trying to make 
it sound exciting!)

<BR><BR>

She started out living in a caravan in the depths of Algeria in Africa, then 
it was off to Kuwait where her Dad had a job as a civil engineer (which 
means he's incredibly polite whilst building things).  But it wasn't long
before they had moved to Nigeria.  It was here that Kirsten encountered 
giant bees. &#34;They weren't real &#34;&#44; she explains, &#34;I was just
hallucinating during a bout of Malaria.  I contracted it after a mosquito 
bit me.  It's a bit scary because it could recur at any time!&#34;

<BR><BR>

Next stop was tropical Singapore.  &#34;I remember Singapore as the place 
I first got interested in pop music.  In my bedroom I had pictures of Neil
Diamond (American singer), Demis Roussos (dodgy Greek in a kaftan) and Leo 
Sayer (he had BIG hair) which my parents had pinned up.  To this day I can 
be seen getting the tube to work in beaded kaftan and open toe sandals.  
Not really. I'm lying to spice up the story.&#34;

<BR><BR>

Anyway, having travelled the world Kirsten and her family knew there was a 
better place, a place meant for them.  A place where the only language 
problem is knowing what a &#39;cuddy wifter&#39; is, and where exotic 
food means having ketchup on your pie and peas.  Yes, it was time to move 
back home to.....(cue fanfare).....<B>MIDDLESBROUGH</B>!!

<BR><BR>

She did the usual school and college stuff there before going to another 
jungle, this time though, it was a concrete one - Birmingham!  Here,
whilst studying for a degree in Media and Communications at the Polytechnic
(it's got a posh University name now), Kirsten got her first real taste of
presenting, appearing in student films and getting up ridiculously early to 
do the traffic and travel reports on the student radio station.

<BR><BR>

After graduating she started working for Tyne Tees TV on their regional news 
programme.  She made tea, researched items, directed bulletins, made tea, 
did interviews, became the programme P.A, and sometimes made tea. 

<BR><BR>

Eventually after constantly hassling everyone around her (and making them 
very nice cups of tea) Kirsten was allowed to present part of a children's
science programme in the summer of 1995.  This involved working with local
students discovering the answers to such conundrums as &#39;Why do we go 
wrinkly in the bath?&#39; &#34;It was great, we sat around with our arms and legs in 
buckets of water until we looked like prunes&#34;

<BR><BR>

It was her skills as a prune impersonator which got her her current job at 
<B>CBBC</B>.  She started broadcasting to Europe on the BBC satellite 
channel &#39;Prune&#39;, er, no sorry &#39;Prime&#39; and can be seen now on Saturday 
mornings on <B>The Saturday Aardvark</B> as well as afternoons and mornings 
on CBBC.  So any last words Kirsten?

<BR><BR>

&#34;Er, sorry, what??  I don't feel very well - agghh run for your 
lives!!! Giant bees!&#34; <BR><BR> P.S. If you're a cuddy wifter you are 
left handed!<BR>

<A NAME="Howie"><B>HOWIE WATKINS,</B></A> best known for presenting 
<A HREF="./trws.htm"><B>The Really Wild Show</B></A> and <B>The Really Wild 
Guide to Britain</B>, graduated from <B>Portsmouth Polytechnic</B> in 1990 
to find the world unprepared for a biologist quite like him. Abandoning the 
path of research he sought an alternative way to pursue his passion for the 
natural world.

<BR><BR>

After moving to South Wales, he became Education Co-ordinator at 
<B>Penscynor Wildlife Park,</B> Neath, from 1990-1994 where he was involved 
in everything from helping to run a captive breeding and public education 
programme for <B>cotton-topped tamarins</B> (a tiny South American monkey), 
to give impromptu talks at animal feeding times.

<BR><BR>

Howie is a regular contributor to <B>BBC Radio Wales.</B> Past stage work 
includes opera singing, acting, directing, producing and writing comedy 
revues.

<BR><BR>

Howie used to run a Cub Scout Pack, and he still finds time to give talks to 
Cubs, Brownies and other groups.  He also works with <B>WATCH</B> - the j
unior wing of the <B>RSNC</B> and continues to raise funds for conservation 
projects around the world.

<BR><BR>

He has now left Penscynor to spend more time pursuing his broadcasting 
career, field work and campaigning for conservation issues. He is a regular 
contributor to a number of television and radio programmes, and occasionally 
reports on environmental issues for <B>GMTV.</B>
