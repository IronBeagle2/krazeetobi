to you, its because he's the son of the ex-president of the United States! Ron

will have you splitting your sides with some of the things he gets up to in

America. Ron had great fun filming through the summer and keeps us in touch with

'Record Breaking' events over there. he told us: &quot;Presenting American

record attempts for <B>Record Breakers</B>, I've discovered that my fellow

citizens are nearly as crazy as you British - thank goodness for that!&quot;<BR><BR><IMG

bursting at the seams with record breaking action. For instance, Ron meets <B>Banana

George</B>, who's the oldest barefoot water-skier in the world, at the grand old

age of 81! You'll also see an aerial stunt man walking on the wing of a Boeing

Stearman bi-plane at an incredible and terrifying 4000 feet! You won't believe

it...it's completely mad! We also get cuddly with 12 Teddy Bears when we send

them off on a mission....their mission, which they have chosen to accept, is to

try and break the world record by hitch-hiking more than 50,000 miles around the

world. Is it mission impossible? You'll have to tune in to find out.<BR><BR>So
