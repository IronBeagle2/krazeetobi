<B>Yes, Record Breakers is back! And we're Bigger, Better and Brighter than 
ever!</B> 

<BR><BR>

There’s another chance to see highlights of the special 25th Anniversary 
series of <B>Record Breakers</B> starting on 

<BR><BR>

<B>Friday 27th June at 5.10pm.</B> 

<BR><BR>

It’s your chance to re-live those classic Record Breakers moments !

<BR><BR>

We are currently busy making the 26th Series of <B>Record Breakers</B> 
which wil be shown later this year. The office is up and running and we 
are working hard capturing truly spectacular record breaking attempts the 
world over.

<BR><BR>

<IMG ALIGN="RIGHT" SRC="./images/cherkris.jpg">
<B>Cheryl Baker</B> and 
<B>Kriss Akabusi</B> are back to present more amazing 
record breaking attempts. They are joined by our American presenter 
<B>Ron Reagan Junior</B> for some stunning record 
breaking attempts taking place in the States.  During our trips to America 
we’ll be filming attempts at Baton Twirling, Unicycling, In-line Skating, 
a Balloon Bungee, Footbagging and Joggling(?). Don’t attempt any of these 
at home without a responsible adult in attendance!

<BR><BR>

<B>Kriss</B> and <B>Cheryl</B> 
are also joined by new presenter, <B>Dan Roland</B>, who joins us fresh 
from MTV. As well as giving a quirky new angle to some crazy British 
records, Dan will have the arduous task of travelling with a fun crew 
around the world to film some spectacular record attempts, lucky him! From 
every destination Dan will be beaming back &#34;Fact Files&#34; on classic 
Record Breakers such as the world’s tallest building in Kuala Lumpur; the 
most active volcano in Hawaii, plus the longest bridge in Canada. Join him 
on his crazy adventures around the world - and find out where he’s got to 
on his travels each week !

<BR><BR>

Plus, it’s your chance to star in the audience for the world’s most 
spectacular record-breaking action. We invite you to one of three special 
recordings which will contain all the thrills and spills of real world 
record attempts performed <B>LIVE</B> in front of the Record Breakers’ 
cameras with you as a member of the audience. 

<BR><BR>

Each two hour show will take place at the <B>Chase Leisure Centre</B> in 
<B>Cannock</B> on the <B>27th, 28th and 29th of August.</B> Every day will 
be a Record Breaker, so simply pick your day and come along and join in the 
excitement. We’ll be smashing world records ranging from Mountain Bike 
High-jumps and Precision Gymnastics, to Dog Agility and Tiddly-winks.  

<BR><BR>

<B>Tickets are FREE so phone our Ticket Hotline on 0181 225 9560 and 
reserve your tickets TODAY !

<BR><BR>

Telephone calls will be charged at normal rates, so be sure to ask 
permission from the person paying the bill before you call</B> 

<BR><BR>

Under 15’s must be accompanied by an adult.  

<BR>

Unfortunately, this event is not suitable for children under 5 years.

<BR><BR>

We’re also looking for new record-breaking stories for the programme. Are 
you organising a record attempt? What can you do? Are you, or is your event 
the biggest, fastest, tallest, smallest, or slowest? Are you doing 
something bonkers? If something is somehow the best in the world - then 
Record Breakers may cover it. We have so far covered attempts ranging from 
the world’s biggest simultaneous line-dance, to the fastest time a JCB has 
travelled from John O’Groats to Lands End, and the world’s smallest 
Basketball player !

<BR><BR>

But we need more stories and we need your help! We need to know about your 
seriously big record-breaking attempts. Our team are out and about filming 
in the UK and all over the World this summer - so let us know about your 
attempts and events and our presenters and crew could be there!

record-breaking stories and let us know what you would like to see again - 
who knows, we may be able to slot it in.

<BR><BR>
