We’re also looking for new record-breaking stories for the programme. Are 
you organising a record attempt? What can you do? Are you, or is your event 
the biggest, fastest, tallest, smallest, or slowest? Are you doing 
something bonkers? If something is somehow the best in the world - then 
Record Breakers may cover it. We have so far covered attempts ranging from 
the world’s biggest simultaneous line-dance, to the fastest time a JCB has 
travelled from John O’Groats to Lands End, and the world’s smallest 
Basketball player !

But we need more stories and we need your help! We need to know about 
<b>your</b> seriously big record-breaking attempts. Our team are out and 
about filming in the UK and all over the World this summer - so let us know 
about your attempts and events and our presenters and crew could be there!
