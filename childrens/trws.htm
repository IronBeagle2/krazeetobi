The Really Wild Show Team is on Safari in <b>Kenya</b> in the final 
programme of the series.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="./stars.htm#Howie"><B>Howie Watkins</B></A> decides to do a spot of
baby-sitting, but realises that it's a jumbo task when Emily, Zoe and Aitong
turn out to be <b>elephants.</b> The keepers at <b>Nairobi Elephant 
Orphanage</b> devote their lives to caring for the baby elephants who arrive 
distressed at the centre after poachers have killed their parents. As 
elephants are normally nursed by their mothers over several years, these
young orphans need constant love and affection. 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Howie"><B>Howie</B></A> helps bottle-feed the elephants and 
discovers that the keepers even sleep with them at night.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="./stars.htm#Michaela"><B>Michaela Strachan</B></A> meets 15-year-old
<b>Andy Kioko</b>, whose father is in charge of the wildlife parks in Kenya.
Andy is concerned about the effects of tourism on the cheetahs at the 
<b>Massai Mara Reserve</b> which has over 250,000 visitors a year. &#34;Over
the last three years the cheetah population in the Mara has dropped by about
30&#37;&#34; explains Andy. The cheetahs often starve or suffer from 
stress-related diseases because they are constantly surrounded by tourist 
vehicles which get in the way of their hunting.

<BR><BR>

During their tour of the reserve, <b>Andy</b> and 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Michaela"><B>Michaela</B></A> see five jeeps full of 
French and Italian tourists hurtle on to the scene and drive between a
cheetah and her prey. The cheetah tries to carry on for a while, but
finally gives up and slumps under a tree.

<BR><BR>

<A HREF="./stars.htm#Michaela"><B>Michaela's</B></A> next stop is <b>Lake 
Naivasha</b> in Kenya's ancient Rift Valley. The lake is home to a spectacular 
array of wildlife. &#34;The Lake is one of my favourite places in the world
and I couldn't wait to get back there&#34; she says.

<BR><BR>

There, <A HREF="./stars.htm#Michaela"><B>Michaela</B></A> joins conservationist
<b>Damien Cook</b> who takes her on a safari around the Lake. They encounter
a group of noisy <b>hippos</b>, but Damien looks very nervous when several
start to dive underwater. Hippos are regarded as the most dangerous animals 
in Africa and have been known to kill hundreds of people a year. As they 
creep closer to the hippos, Damien warns: &#34;You should never get between
a hippo and the water. It feels safe in water and you're in trouble if you
block its escape route. They can run surprisingly fast and have such a huge
mouth and strong tusks that they've even been known to chomp a lion in two!&#34;
