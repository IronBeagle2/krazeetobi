<FONT SIZE="4">

There's top news from Children's BBC because <b>Otis</b>, 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Kirsten"><B>Kirsten</B></A>, 
<A HREF="./stars.htm#Richard"><B>Richard</B></A>
and <b>Dominic</b> are moving to a brand new Children's BBC studio!

<BR><BR>

Our new home is called <b>Studio 9</b> and it's totally cool. There's a whole
new set to discover, a big new video wall shaped like a number 9 and even 
monster plants Otis will have to remember to feed.  (I wonder if they like 
toffees and ants, like him?!)

<BR><BR>

Studio 9 is where all of your top Children's BBC shows will be presented
from.  It's right next to the Blue Peter Garden so we're bound to see
the <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19970721000000/http://bbc.co.uk/blue_peter/"><B>B.P.</B></A> team a lot, too!
