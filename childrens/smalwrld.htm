<B>Small World </B>is a new series of films now showing on Sunday mornings 
on <b>BBC2</b> about children in many parts of the world facing up to 
important changes in their lives.     

<BR><BR>

Already it has featured a film from the United States following an eleven 
year old Apache girl through one of her tribe's ancient and sacred rituals, 
called <B>&quot;The Sunrise Dance&quot;</B>. There was also a film tying in 
with British fashion week following <b>Kira Langer,</b> who at the age of 15 
became one of Britain's top young fashion models, and it looked at how she 
coped with the pressures of life on the catwalk and the demands of school.

<BR><BR>

If you missed those, don't worry as there are other fascinating films still 
lined up. 

<BR><BR>

<B>&quot;Somehow Free&quot;</B> meets 12 year old <B>Najibulha Ebrat</B> who moved to 
Germany with his family from trouble torn Afghanistan. Najibulha had polio, 
and the film follows him on his first adventure holiday, where he tries out 
lots of new exciting activites.   This is scheduled for <B>6th October.</B>

<BR><BR>

Eleven year old <B>Nosizwe Baqwa</B> who was born and brought up in Norway 
and is black, recently also moved to a new home thousands of miles away - 
to Cape Town, South Africa. <B>&quot;I left my heart&quot;</B> finds out how 
she comes to terms with homesickness and how she settles down to a very 
different way of life.  This is being shown on <b>13th October.</b>

<BR><BR>

On <B>20th October</B> there is a film from Finland about relationships! 
The Finns have carried out research on the dating behaviour of 9 to 12 year 
olds and it shows crushes, discos and the first steady boy and girl friends 
play a surprisingly big part in their lives. That led to the idea of the 
film <B>&quot;A lot of liking&quot;.</B> It takes a sensitive look at 
romance from both boys' and girls' points of view. The programme's title 
was in fact suggested by eleven year old <B>Niina</B> who said, &quot;To me 
&#39;first love&#39; sounds stupid.   I think we don't &#39;love&#39;, we 
&#39;like&#39;.&quot;

<BR><BR>

<B>&quot;Small World&quot;</B> was made through the <B>European Broadcasting 
Union</B> - the same people who brought you <B>&quot;The Animals of Farthing 
Wood&quot;</B> and the Eurovision Song Contest. The EBU has a special 
Working Party for Children and Young People which gets together each year to
make documentaries for children.

all over the world....
