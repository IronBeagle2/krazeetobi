<H2>Grange Hill</H2>

<P>Strict religious beliefs, bullying, Anglo-French relationships, and coping

with ME are on <B>Grange Hill's</B> new syllabus when the twice-weekly BBC-1

school drama returns from <B>Friday, 6th September</B>.<BR><BR>The school

opens its gates to a new caretaker, <B>Russell Joseph</B>, and a new Head of

the French department, <B>Madame Sylvie Lefevre</B>, a chic but formidable

woman who won't stand any nonsense. Her daughter, <B>Cecile</B>, does not go to

<B>Grange Hill</B>, but still gets involved in the school production and in a

secret relationship with six-form heartthrob <B>Joe</B>.<BR><BR>There are two

new pupils in Year 8, bright sparky <B>Laurie Watson</B>, who left her last

school because she was a &quot;mouthy little madam&quot; and <B>Chris Longworth</B>,

who is something of a mystery to his new form and a source of intrigue and

imaginative speculation for <B>Anna Wright</B>.<BR><BR>One of <B>Madame

Lefevre's</B> first duties is to organise a French exchange with students from

Year 8. At the specially arranged disco the pupils seem very keen to practice

their French, but their reasons appear to be romantic rather than educational.<BR><BR><B>Mr.

Parrott</B> is introduced to the world of poker, by one of the French teachers,

and his bank account suffers the consequences. He also gives <B>Robyn</B> extra

tuition for her maths. Rumours start amongst pupils that there is more going on.<BR><BR>The

end of the year school musical runs into teething problems and <B>Gabriel</B>,

who is directing, has to cope with squabbles and budget difficulties.<BR><BR><B>Poppy</B>

is continually bullied by <B>Wayne</B> and when she finally decides to seek

help, through the school's anti-bullying scheme (run by the students themselves)

she discovers that <B>Wayne</B> suffers similar torrents of abuse at home from

his brother.<BR><BR>Producer Christine Secombe says: &quot;Much of the series

continued success is due to the realistic storylines on issues children

throughout the country can easily relate to&quot;<BR><BR>There will be a new

series of <B>Grange Hill</B> on <B>Children's BBC</B> in the New Year. More

information on that will be on this page nearer the time!</P>
