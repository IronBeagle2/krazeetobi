<BR><BR>

All of your favourites will be included with some new characters in Year 7

<LI>Get good training - join a school drama club if you have one, or find 
out if there is a club or amateur society in your area. 

<BR><BR>

<LI>Always keep in mind that it is extremely hard to make a living as an actor - 
for every actor who is working, thousands are not. And although a few famous 
people earn good money, the majority are not well paid. So you should not 
neglect your school work. Make sure you have plenty of other skills with 
which you can make a living.

<BR><BR>

<LI>It is extremely difficult to get a part on CBBC. Most of our directors see 
on average <B>200 children</B> for one part. They (or their casting directors)
tend to approach both stage schools and agencies, as well as ordinary schools 
and clubs where it is known that there is good drama teaching. But there is 
no list of such places. Every director has his/her own network of contacts 
built up from experience.

<BR><BR>

<LI>Most directors have contacts in different parts of the country, 
depending on the requirements of the script. There is a book called 
&#34;Spotlight&#34; which has photos of actors and lists their agents. There 
is also a &#34;Children’s Spotlight&#34;. If you can find a copy at your
local library, you might find it helpful to look at it.

<BR><BR>

<LI>Many young people write to us enclosing photos and CV and asking for 
auditions. Sadly, we simply do not have the time to see everyone, nor can 
we afford to pay travel expenses. Very occasionally, if someone has an 
exceptional CV a director might see them, but it is extremely rare.

<BR><BR>

<LI>If, with the agreement and support of your parents, you decide to 
approach an agent, the procedure is normally as follows:

<BR><BR>

i)	A meeting (accompanied by a parent) with agent to see if the agent wishes 
to take you onto their books.

<BR><BR>

ii)	If the agent agrees to take you on, they may ask you or your parent to 
sign a contract. You <B>MUST</B> have this checked by a lawyer - your local 
Citizens Advice Bureau will probably help.

<BR><BR>

iii)	The normal procedure is for agents to take a percentage (usually 10%) 
of money earned by a child as their fee.  It is not customary for money to 
be requested up front prior to work, except perhaps for photographs.

<BR><BR>

iv)	We cannot supply lists of agents, but there is a book called 
<B>&#34;Contacts&#34;</B> which lists them and is published by:

<BR><BR>

<LI>If you should ever be offered a professional part on TV or in the 
theatre you will need the permission of your school to be absent.

<BR><BR>

So it is important that you work hard so that your teachers would not feel 
your work would suffer by being away from school.  (You would have to have 
lessons whilst filming of course).

<BR><BR>

<LI>Remember there are many other jobs in showbusiness apart from acting. 
Learning about stage management, stage design, costume and make up, sound 
recording, scriptwriting, choreography etc. can also be valuable. Whatever 
area interests you, the more experience you can get, even in an amateur 
capacity, the better.

<BR><BR>

Most people who eventually make it into showbusiness have usually been doing 
something connected with TV or theatre from a young age, although they are 
very likely to have gone to acting or music college or university in between.

<b>Good Luck!</b>
