<A NAME="Beta 3">
<h3 align=center><font size=5>B</font>ETA 3 FEATURES</a></h3>
<h4>Mail and News</h4>
<ul>
<li><B>Mail Password:</B> Beta 3 will now remember your mail password. To enable this feature, check the &quot;Remember Mail 
Password&quot; on the Organization panel of the mail and news preferences.</li>

<p>
<li><B>New Mail Indicator:</B> There is a new mail preference &quot;Check for mail every <EM>n</EM> minutes&quot; on the Servers panel of the mail 
and news preferences. As long as the Navigator is running it will check for new mail at the specified frequency. If there is 
new mail the mail will not be automatically downloaded; the mail indicator in the lower right corner of the Browser, Mail, 
and News windows will change appearance. Click the mail indicator to open the Mail window and retrieve new mail.</li>

<p>
<li><B>Find:</B> You can now search for text in the headers of mail and news messages using the Find command located on the Edit 
menu. Find searches the displayed headers of the messages in the current folder, starting with the current message. Use 
Find Again to continue with the next message.</li>

</ul>

<h4><B>Bookmarks</B></h4>
<ul>
<li><B>What's New?</B>: There is a What's New? menu item on the File menu that brings up a window that you can use to identify 
bookmarks that have changed since you last visited them. You can choose to check all bookmarks in the bookmark list, or 
just the selected bookmarks and bookmarks inside selected folders.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Images</h4>
<ul>
<li><B>Background:</B> Beta 3 no longer waits for the background image to completely arrive before displaying any text and images 
on a page. When the background image has been decoded the page is redrawn to include the background.</li>

<p>
<li><B>Colormap:</B> For those running in 256 color mode, pages with a single GIF image should look better because a custom 
colormap is installed. This is for GIF images only and not for JPEG images.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Windows 95</h4>
<ul>
<li><B>Internet Shortcuts:</B> Internet shortcuts are working in beta 3</li>

<p>
<li><B>Microsoft Exchange:</B> You can use Microsoft Exchange for sending and receiving email by checking the &quot;Use Exchange 
Client for Mail and News&quot; option on the Appearance page of the mail and news preferences.
</ul>

<h4>International Support</h4>
<UL>
<LI>1. MimePartII conversion for mail and news subject list pane. Multibyte
characters display correctly now in this pane. In the case of Simplified
Chinese, HZ conversion is done for the subject list pane to correctly
display double-byte characters.
<P>
<LI>2. Options | General Preferences | Language "Accept Language" is functional.
The purpose of this dialog box is to enable the user to select a
prioritized list of language/region codes that reflect what language a user
wishes to display a document in, if that document is available in different
language translations. The "accept language" information is contained in the
HTTP Header's HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE. A server that provides different
language versions of the same content could thus accomodate a user's
preferred language.
<P>
<LI>3. Options | Document Encoding selection can now be changed when viewing Mail
and News. The selected encoding will be applied to enable viewing of
documents of different encodings (e.g. Japanese) provided the user's system
supports fonts for that locale.
<P>
<LI>4. Search capability is now based on character to enable searching for
strings containing multibyte characters.
<P>
<LI>5. Pasting 8 bit characters into mail compose window now works correctly.

<B>Support for Java Applets:</B>
<P>
 <LI>Java is currently supported on Windows 95 and Windows NT.
<P>
 <LI>There is a preference to disable Java applets located in the General panel
     of the security preferences.  Java support is enabled by default.

          <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>JavaScript</H3>
<P>
  <B>Built-in JavaScript:</B> Netscape Navigator now includes a built-in
     scripting language, called JavaScript. JavaScript development is based on
     the JAVA language, which extends and enhances the capability of HTML
     documents. JavaScript supports most of JAVA's expression syntax and
     basic control flow constructs, but without JAVA's strong type checking
     and static typing. JavaScript is embedded in HTML documents with a
     SCRIPT tag, and there is no compilation needed to run the script.

<P>
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/">
 JavaScript Documentation</A> is now available.<P>


	<A NAME="Mail">
	<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Read Mail with the Netscape Navigator</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>Reading your email:</B>
A new Mail Window allows you to read your email, sort the messages,
file them in folders, and mail replies.
<P>
<LI><B>New Mail Reading Window:</B>
The Mail Window has 3 panes:  a mail folder pane, a message list
pane, and a message text pane.  You can adjust the relative sizes of the
panes by dragging the pane dividers.  You may want to start by
making the mail folder pane a little wider so that you can see the
names of the mail folders.  The individual columns in each pane
can be adjusted.  Hold the mouse over the column titles.  A corner
will activate when you're at the end of a column title.  You can drag
and drop the corner to resize the columns.
<P>
Netscape comes with a sample mail message.  Click on the "inbox"
folder to see the message.  You can use the toolbar button or menu to
Get New Mail.  You can navigate through your mail messages
by clicking on the "Date", "Sender", or "Subject" fields of the
message list pane.  The buttons and Go Menu also help you navigate.
<P>
A bold message in the message list signifies that you have not read
this message yet.  Once you read it, it becomes normal (i.e. unbold).
<P>
<LI><B>Organizing your Mail:</B>
The Sort Menu allows you to view your list of messages in various ways.
You can even thread the messages by subject.  The Edit Menu lets you 
select and delete messages.  Deleted messages are put in a mail folder
called "trash".  You can create other mail folders with the File Menu.
</UL>
<p>
      <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Brand new News Interface</H3>

<UL>

<LI><B>New News Reading Window:</B>
The News Reader was rewritten to provide a more concise view of the
news hosts, newsgroups, and articles.  It uses the same type of 3-paned 
window that the Mail reader uses.  Your existing <tt>newsrc</tt>
file is compatible with the new news interface.
<P>
<LI><B>Reading News Articles:</B>
Reading news is very much like reading mail messages.  Instead of
Getting New Mail, you can click on the newsgroup to bring up the
list of articles and see the new ones that have arrived.  
<P>
</UL>
</UL>


	<A NAME="Images">
	<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Better Images and Document Presentation</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Frames -- Multiple documents on one page:</B>
Frames are a way of specifying multiple, independent, scrollable regions 
within a display window.  Each frame can contain a seperate HTML
document. Users can scroll and resize frames, at the choice of the page
creator.  Each frame can also be given NAME values, so they can be targeted by
links in other documents or other frames. These features provide a powerful
new way of presenting documents.

    Cool Examples of Frames</A>
<P>
<A HREF="demo/framedemo.html">I've been framed!</A>
<P>

<LI><B>Targeted Windows:</B>
Browser windows can now have names associated with them.
Links in any window can refer to another window by name.
When you click on the link, the document you asked for
will appear in that named window.  If the window is not
already open, Netscape will open and name a new window for
you.  They are especially useful with frames.
<P>
Here's the <A HREF="demo/target.html" TARGET=named_window>whole story in a new window.</A>

<P>
The syntax for the targeted windows is:<p>

&ltA HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name"&gt

<A HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name">Click here and open a New Window</A>
&lt/A&gt
<P>
A new BASE tag allows you to pick a default named target window
for every link in a document that does not have an
explicit TARGET attribute.  It's format is:
<p>
&ltBASE TARGET="default_target"&gt
<p>
<LI><B>Client-Side Image Maps:</B>
We have implemented the 
<A HREF=ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-clientsideimagemap-01.txt> 
IETF Internet Draft</A> for client-side image maps.
This is similar to server-side ISMAP images: You are
presented with an image that you can click on to take you 
to a number of different sites. 
<P>
With server-side image maps, the x,y coordinates of the click
are sent to the server, and the server decides which URL you see.
With client-side image maps, the MAP that relates parts of 
the image to different URLs is stored in the current file.
<P>
This saves a round trip to the server, and should present 
documents to you faster.  Since the MAP information
is stored in the document you are viewing, the destination
URLs can be displayed in the status area as you pass the mouse
over the image map.
<P>
Try the <A HREF=#ClientSide>client-side image map</A>
 at the bottom of this page.
<P>

<LI><B>Fast, Progressive JPEG images:</B>
Support for progressive JPEG images gives you high quality
images that load faster than regular JPEG or GIF images.
The progressive loading is smoother than the interlaced
GIF loading, so you can identify the image sooner.
<P>
<A HREF="demo/pjpegdemo.html">See a demo</A>
<P>
<LI><B>Automatic Dithering:</B>
In previous releases, you had to decide between 
"Dither to Color Cube" and "Use Closest Color in Color Cube".
This preference was set for every image on every page.
<P>
Now you can specify "Automatic Dithering" and Netscape will
make the decision to dither or not for each image on the
page.  In general, your images should look better with
automatic dithering.  The old options are still there,
so if you want to set them yourself, you can.
<P>
The default setting is "Automatic Dithering".
<P>

<LI><B>FONT <FONT COLOR="Red">C</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">L</FONT><FONT COLOR="Purple">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Brown">R</FONT>
 tag:</B>
In addition to specifying font colors for text and links
on a whole page, you can use the new COLOR attribute in the
FONT tag to choose colors for just part of a page, or part of a
<FONT COLOR="Brown">W</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">R</FONT><FONT COLOR="Red">D</FONT>!

The syntax for the FONT tag is as follows:
<p>
&ltFONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
&ltFONT COLOR="#00FF00"&gt<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Green</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
&ltFONT COLOR="#0000FF"&gt<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
<p>
You can also use Color Names instead color codes.  For Example, the syntax
could also be: 
<p>
&ltFONT COLOR="Purple"&gt<FONT COLOR="purple">Purple</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt
<p>
This is also true with the &ltBODY BGCOLOR="Black" TEXT="White"&gt tag.
<p>

<LI><B>DIV tag:</B>
We support a new HTML 3.0 tag that lets you
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="left">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotleft&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Left justify text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="center">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotcenter&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Center some text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="right">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotright&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Right justify some text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>

<LI><B>WRAP attribute in the TEXTAREA tag:</B>
You can specify how to handle word-wrapping in text input areas
in forms.
<P>
<UL> <DL>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=OFF&gt -- the default setting
<DD>Wrapping doesn't happen.  Lines are sent exactly as typed.
<P>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=VIRTUAL&gt
<DD>The display word-wraps, but long lines are sent as one
line without new-lines.
<P>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=PHYSICAL&gt
<DD>The display word-wraps, and the text is transmitted at
all wrap points.
<P>
</DL> </UL>

<LI><B>Support for superscripts and for subscripts.</B>
<P>
The &ltSUP&gt &lt/SUP&gt tags let you define <SUP>super</SUP>scripts.
<P>
The &ltSUB&gt &lt/SUB&gt tags let you define <SUB>sub</SUB>scripts.
<P>

<LI><B>You can Quote me on that -- A stricter HTML parser:</B>
The HTML parser now pays close attention to quotes within HTML tags.
Check your HTML source for missing quote marks if you see
pages that have missing or broken images, or have pieces of
text scattered about and overlaying other parts of the document.
<P>

<LI><B>Netscape now conforms to GIF standards:</B>
Some GIF creation utilities produce GIF images that do not conform
to standards.  Such images will display empty outlines in place of
the image.  These outlines are much larger than the actual images.
The images will not be visible at all.
<P>
To repair these GIF images,
content providers can read the offending GIF image into a
different GIF utility that conforms to the GIF89a specifications,
and save the image again.
<P>

<H3>User Interfaces</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>Rearranged Tabbed dialog panels for Preferences:</B>
The panels were rearranged and several changes were made to 
accommodate new features.
<P>

<LI><B>View Menu | Document Information in an HTML page:</B>
Document Information gives you detailed information
about all of the images and grid documents in your browser window.
The information is displayed in a separate window.  You can click
on the links in the top half of that window to change the detailed information
in the bottom half of the window.  It's also a good demonstration of frames.
</UL>


	<A NAME="Access">

<H3>Access Improvements</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>HTTP File Upload:</B>
Previously, form input was limited to input boxes and other simple
elements like checkboxes and radio buttons.  Now you can write forms
that ask for files as input, as described in the
<A HREF=ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-03.txt>
IETF Internet Draft.</A>
<P>
A new "ENCTYPE" attribute on the &ltFORM&gt tag allows you to write forms that
take files as input.  An example of such a form would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    &ltFORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&gt

<BR>Send this file: &ltINPUT NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"&gt

<BR>&ltINPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&gt

<H3>Additional Languages and MIME Charsets Supported</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>Previous releases support browsing Western European languages and
        Japanese.  Navigator 2.0 adds support for Central European (latin2)
        languages, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.
    <P> 
    <LI>MIME charsets supported include:
           <UL>
                "us-ascii", "iso-8859-1", "x-mac-roman", "iso-8859-2", "x-mac-ce",

           </UL>
    <P>
    <LI> The support of languages requires the appropriate system font
         is installed on your system.
    <P>      
    <LI>For Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese,
        the system must also provide support for 2-byte codes and input
        methods.  For Windows, you will need Japanese Windows, Korean
        Windows or Chinese Windows.
</UL>

<H3>META Tag Extension for MIME Charset Info</H3>
<UL>
      <LI> The IETF draft on Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup
          Language proposes an extension to the HTML META tag to allow
          MIME charset information to be contained in the HTML document:<p>
      
      &ltMETA HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=ISO-2022-JP"&gt
       
      <LI>This support is in Navigator 2.0 and the MIME charset values
          supported includes all the charsets mentioned above in the section
          on "Additional Languages and MIME Charsets Supported.
</UL>

<H3>Document Encoding User Interface</H3>
<UL>        
      <LI>Document Encoding Defaults are now easier to change.  Previous
          releases provided a preference panel to globally set the
          default character encoding of incoming documents.
      <P>
      <LI>Navigator 2.0 makes the default selection more accessible by
          moving it to the "Options | Document Encoding->" menu item.
      <P>
      <LI>Document encoding defaults are no longer global, so that a
          user may have multiple browser windows open in different
          default encodings (e.g., Japanse in one and French in another).
      <P>
      <LI>User Defined encoding is available for encodings that we have
          not yet added support.

                       <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Security Improvements</H3>

<UL>

<LI><B>Technical Background:</B>

<P>Netscape Navigator uses random information to generate session
encryption keys. The random information is found through a variety of
functions that look into a user's machine for information.  Previous
releases of Netscape Navigator were subject to potential vulnerabilities
because the size of random input was less than the size of the
subsequent
keys. This means that instead of searching through all the 2^128
possible
keys by brute force, a potential intruder only had to search through a
significantly smaller key space by brute force.

<P>Netscape Navigator 2.0 incorporates fixes to the specific portion
of our software where this potential vulnerability existed. We have
significantly increased the amount of random information
from approximately 30 bits to approximately 300 bits. Netscape
has greatly expanded the techniques and sources used to generate
these amounts of random information and the fixes have been reviewed
and validated by several weeks of intensive testing on the Internet.
<P>

<LI><B>Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security of
their
transactions:</B><P>

<UL><LI>If the attacker has physical access to your machine, security
cannot be assured.<P>

<LI>Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents can log into
your machine, little can be secure. For secure servers, any insecure
connection mechanism could be suspect. Multi-user UNIX platforms will
not be as secure as single-user machines.

<UL>Details: Some of the system specific information that is used in the
seed generation is available to any user on that system.</UL><P>

<LI>To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed into
the seed generation algorithm. Wary users can alter their user environment
before running Netscape software. <P>

<LI>If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, they can
pretty much do anything.<P>

<LI>Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator. Use a
version native to the platform on which you are running.

<UL>Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation depends upon
the unpredictability of the low order bits of various clocks and timers.
The clocks of many emulators may have much less entropy than the actual
builtin clocks. </UL><P>

<LI>If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the security of
your X server. This is also true if the X connection is not to a local
machine as all of the events and the data from the screen read may be
captured from the ethernet.

<UL>Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input then its
randomness is not useful.</UL><P>

<LI>It is better to perform some user action before connecting to a
secure
site. This means you should not set your home page to a secure site or
launch your client from a command line to a secure site.

<UL>Details: While navigating through menus or typing into various form
fields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability of details of the user
actions to increase the entropy of the RNG state.</UL><P></UL>

           not reflect the Bookmark menu item.
      <LI> If you click outside the AddressBook Property Window, occasionally,
           your machine might Freeze or GPF. 
      <LI> 16 bit help in preferences is not functional yet.

      <LI> If you are crashing a lot running 2.0 please delete or rename
           your old history file "NETSCAPE.HST".  
      <LI> Can't submit forms using 16 bit 2.0 on Windows NT.
      <P>
      <LI><B> JavaScript bugs: </B>
	   <UL>
	   <LI> The selectedIndex property of SELECT popups is always 
                the number of options, not the selected option's index.
	   <LI> The INPUT focus() and select() force focus into an 
                input tag and select its contents, respectively, 
                but they don't display the usual visual cues such as 
                insertion caret and highlighting.

<H3>Known Java problems with the 32bit Navigator:</H3>
<ul> 
<li> The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes.
<li> Applet audio sometimes doesn't work correctly on NT systems.
<li> The Java console window cannot be closed using the system menu.
<li> On 256 color systems some colormap flashing may occur.
<li> When moving between pages, applets may occasionally appear on the wrong page.
Choose Refresh from the View menu to correct this.
</ul>

<H3>Known bugs in International support.</H3>
<UL>
<LI> Document Encoding | User defined has not been implemented.

<LI> When sending mail, Navigator doesn't do MimePartII conversion for
sender. Thus name of sender may display incorrectly if sender name contains
multibyte characters.

<LI> If Navigator used on a machine using Japanese Windows locale, the text
on several buttons in the Options | General Preferences | Fonts dialog box
will misdisplay. The names of the fonts may also misdisplay. However, the
font functionality is unaffected. They will display correctly when viewing
documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document encoding you
have selected via Options | Document Encoding, and the document you are
viewing was encoded using that character set).

<LI> Entering multibyte characters in forms is not implemented in this release.
</UL>
