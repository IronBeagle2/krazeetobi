<A NAME="JavaScript"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>JavaScript</H3><P>
  <B>Built-in JavaScript:</B> Netscape Navigator now includes a built-in 
     scripting language, called JavaScript. JavaScript development is 
     based on the JAVA language, which extends and enhances the capability
     of HTML documents. JavaScript supports most of JAVA's expression syntax
     and basic control flow constructs, but without JAVA's strong type 
     checking and static typing. JavaScript is embedded in HTML documents
     with a SCRIPT tag, and there is no compilation needed to run the script.<P>
     See the <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/script_info/index.html">online JavaScript Documentation</A>.<P>

<A NAME="Mail">	<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Read Mail with the 
Netscape Navigator</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Reading your email:</B>A new Mail Window allows you to read your
       email, sort the messages,file them in folders, and mail replies.<P>
   <LI><B>New Mail Reading Window:</B>The Mail Window has 3 panes:  a mail
       folder pane, a message listpane, and a message text pane.  You can
       adjust the relative sizes of thepanes by dragging the pane dividers. 
       You may want to start bymaking the mail folder pane a little wider 
       so that you can see thenames of the mail folders.  The individual 
       columns in each panecan be adjusted.  Hold the mouse over the 
       column titles.  A cornerwill activate when you're at the end of a 
       column title.  You can dragand drop the corner to resize the columns.<P>
       Netscape comes with a sample mail message.  Click on the "inbox"folder
       to see the message.  You can use the toolbar button or menu toGet 
       New Mail.  You can navigate through your mail messagesby clicking on
       the "Date", "Sender", or "Subject" fields of themessage list pane.  
       The buttons and Go Menu also help you navigate.<P>A bold message in
       the message list signifies that you have not readthis message yet.
       Once you read it, it becomes normal (i.e. unbold).<P>
   <LI><B> Send Now or Send Later - Deferred Mail </B> : Netscape allows 
       you to compose all your email offline and then send them all at once.  
       When you're in the Message Composition Window, select Deferred Delivery
       from the Options menu.  Deffered mail is stored in the OUTBOX folder. 
       When you exit the Mail Window, you will be asked if you want the messages 
       to be sent.  You can also choose "File" | "Send Mail in Outbox" (from the 
       Netscape Mail Window), to send all your deferred Mail. <p>
   <LI><B>Organizing your Mail:</B>The Sort Menu allows you to view your 
       list of messages in various ways.You can even thread the messages 
       by subject.  The Edit Menu lets you select and delete messages. 
       Deleted messages are put in a mail foldercalled "trash".  You can
       create other mail folders with the File Menu.<P>
   <LI><B>Mail Password:</B> Netscape Mail remembers your mail password. 
       To enable this feature, check the &quot;Remember Mail Password&quot;
       on the Organization panel of the mail and news preferences.<p>
   <LI><B>New Mail Indicator:</B> There is a mail preference &quot;
       Check for mail every <EM>n</EM> minutes&quot; on the Servers panel
       of the mail and news preferences. As long as the Navigator is running
       it will check for new mail at the specified frequency. If there is 
       new mail the mail will not be automatically downloaded; the mail 
       indicator in the lower right corner of the Browser, Mail, and 
       News windows will change appearance. Click the mail indicator
       to open the Mail window and retrieve new mail.<p>
   <LI><B>Find:</B> You can search for text in the headers of mail 
       and news messages using the Find command located on the Edit menu.
       Find searches the displayed headers of the messages in the
       current folder, starting with the current message. Use Find Again
       to continue with the next message.

<p><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Brand new News Interface</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>New News Reading Window:</B>The News Reader was rewritten
       to provide a more concise view of thenews hosts, newsgroups,
       and articles.  It uses the same type of 3-paned window that the 
       Mail reader uses.  Your existing <tt>newsrc</tt>file is compatible
       with the new news interface.<P>
   <LI><B>Reading News Articles:</B>Reading news is very much like 
       reading mail messages.  Instead ofGetting New Mail, you can click
       on the newsgroup to bring up thelist of articles and see the new 
       ones that have arrived.  <P>
</UL>


<p><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Mail and News Composition Window</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Updated Mail and News Composition:</B>
       A new Mail and News composition window lets you send new messages,
       and reply to or forward existing messages.  Use the Options Menu | Show
       All Headers command to find fields for carbon copy, blind carbon copy
       (Bcc:), and file carbon copy (Fcc:) where you can save a copy for
       yourself.<P>
   <LI><B>Link to the address book:</B>
       You can type the names of users or mailing lists into the To:, CC:, 
       and BCC: fields. When you click on a new field with the mouse, or hit
       tab, the email addresses will be expanded. Double-clicking on an
       entry in the address book will bring up a new Composition window, 
       addressed to that address.<P>
   <LI><B>Multiple Attachments:</B>
       The Attach button lets you add and delete multiple attachments
       to your email message, including both local files and URLs. <P>
   <LI><B>AppleDouble Attachments:</B>
       Files sent as attachments from the Macintosh version of the 
       Navigator are sent using AppleDouble encoding, which allows for 
       the preservation of Macintosh file forks. On Windows and Unix 
       versions of Navigator, you have the option of receiving these 
       attachments  as either a Macintosh file, which can be saved and
       transferred for use on a Macintosh, or as a data file which can
       be used on the receiving platform.<P>
   <LI><B>More Options:</B>
       Look at the Options Menu | Mail and News... | Compose pane for
       more mail composition options.
</UL>

             <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Address Book for email addresses</H3>
<UL>
    <LI><B>Address Book Window:</B>
        The address book looks and works very much like the bookmarks.
        You can view the whole address book by going to the Window Menu
        and choosing Address Book.
        <P>
        Add Users from the Address Book Window's Item Menu, or automatically
        create an entry from the Message Menu in the Mail or News window.
        <P>
        Do you have lists of people to send mail to?  In the Address Book
        window, mailing lists are represented by the folder icon. Add
        list entries from the Address Book Window's Item menu, then drag
        and drop individual users into the list/folders.
        <P>
        You can use these List and User entries in three ways.
        You can type the nicknames into the mail composition window in the 
        To:, CC:, and BCC: fields.  You can also double-click on an icon in
        the Address Book window to bring up a pre-addressed composition window.

                   <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>New Bookmarks Feature </H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Checks for changed Bookmarks</B>: In Bookmark window, There is a
       What's New? menu item in the File menu that brings up a window that
       you can use to identify bookmarks that have changed since you last visited
       them. You can choose to check all bookmarks in the bookmark list, or just
       the selected bookmarks and bookmarks inside selected folders.

	<A NAME="Images"><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Better Images and Document Presentation</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Frames -- Multiple documents on one page:</B>
       Frames are a way of specifying multiple, independent, scrollable
       regions within a display window.  Each frame can contain a seperate
       HTMLdocument. Users can scroll and resize frames, at the choice of 
       the pagecreator.  Each frame can also be given NAME values, so they
       can be targeted bylinks in other documents or other frames. These 
       features provide a powerful new way of presenting documents.<P>
       <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/assist/net_sites/frames.html">Frame Development Information</A><P>
       <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/frames/index.html"> Cool Examples of Frames</A><P>
       <A HREF="demo/framedemo.html">I've been framed!</A><P>
   <LI><B>Targeted Windows:</B>
       Browser windows can now have names associated with them.Links in
       any window can refer to another window by name.When you click on 
       the link, the document you asked forwill appear in that named window. 
       If the window is notalready open, Netscape will open and name a new 
       window foryou.  They are especially useful with frames.<P>
       Here's the <A HREF="demo/target.html" TARGET=named_window>whole story in a new window.</A><P>
       The syntax for the targeted windows is: 
       <p>&ltA HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name"&gt
       <A HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name">Click here and open a New Window</A>&lt/A&gt<P>
       A new BASE tag allows you to pick a default named target windowfor 
       every link in a document that does not have anexplicit TARGET 
       attribute.  It's format is:
       <p>&ltBASE TARGET="default_target"&gt<p>
   <LI><B>Client-Side Image Maps:</B>
       We have implemented the <A HREF=ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-clientsideimagemap-01.txt> IETF Internet Draft</A>
       for client-side image maps.This is similar to server-side 
       ISMAP images: You arepresented with an image that you can click on
       to take you to a number of different sites. <P>

       With server-side image maps, the x,y coordinates of the click
       are sent to the server, and the server decides which URL you see.
       With client-side image maps, the MAP that relates parts of the 
       image to different URLs is stored in the current file.<P>
       
       This saves a round trip to the server, and should present documents
       to you faster.  Since the MAP informationis stored in the document
       you are viewing, the destinationURLs can be displayed in the status
       area as you pass the mouseover the image map.<P>Try the 
       <A HREF=#ClientSide>client-side image map</A> at the bottom of 
       this page.<P>
   <LI><B>Background Image:</B>
       Netscape no longer waits for the background image to completely
       arrive before displaying any text and images on a page. When 
       the background image has been decoded the page is redrawn to 
       include the background.<p>
   <LI><B>Custom Colormap:</B> 
       For those running in 256 color mode, pages with a single GIF
       image should look better because a custom colormap is installed.
       This is for GIF images only and not for JPEG images.  To view a 
       .gif image by itself, use right mouse button to click on the image,
       and choose "View this Image" from the pop-up menu.<P>
   <LI><B>Fast, Progressive JPEG images:</B>
       Support for progressive JPEG images gives you high qualityimages
       that load faster than regular JPEG or GIF images.The progressive
       loading is smoother than the interlacedGIF loading, so you can identify
       the image sooner.<P>
       <A HREF="demo/pjpegdemo.html">See a demo</A><P>
   <LI><B>Automatic Dithering:</B>In previous releases, you had to 
       decide between "Dither to Color Cube" and "Use Closest Color in 
       Color Cube".This preference was set for every image on every page.<P>

       Now you can specify "Automatic Dithering" and Netscape willmake the 
       decision to dither or not for each image on thepage.  In general, your
       images should look better withautomatic dithering.  The old options 
       are still there, so if you want to set them yourself, you can.<P>

       The default setting is "Automatic Dithering".<P>

   <LI><B>FONT <FONT COLOR="Red">C</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">L</FONT><FONT COLOR="Purple">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Brown">R</FONT> tag:</B>
       In addition to specifying font colors for text and linkson a whole page,
       you can use the new COLOR attribute in theFONT tag to choose colors for
       just part of a page, or part of a<FONT COLOR="Brown">W</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">R</FONT><FONT COLOR="Red">D</FONT>!
       The syntax for the FONT tag is as follows:<p>&ltFONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>&ltFONT COLOR="#00FF00"&gt<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Green</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>&ltFONT COLOR="#0000FF"&gt<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR><p>
       You can also use Color Names instead color codes.  For Example, the 
       syntaxcould also be: 
       <p>&ltFONT COLOR="Purple"&gt<FONT COLOR="purple">Purple</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt
       <p>This is also true with the &ltBODY BGCOLOR="Black" TEXT="White"&gt tag.<p>
    <LI><B>DIV tag:</B>We support a new HTML 3.0 tag that lets you<P>
        <DIV ALIGN="left"><tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotleft&quot&gt</tt><BR>

        The &ltSUP&gt &lt/SUP&gt tags let you define 
        <SUP>super</SUP>scripts.<P>
        The &ltSUB&gt &lt/SUB&gt tags let you define <SUB>sub</SUB>scripts.<P>
    <LI><B>You can Quote me on that -- A stricter HTML parser:</B>
        The HTML parser now pays close attention to quotes within HTML 
        tags.Check your HTML source for missing quote marks if you 
        seepages that have missing or broken images, or have pieces
        oftext scattered about and overlaying other parts of the document.<P>
    <LI><B>Netscape now conforms to GIF standards:</B>Some GIF creation 
        utilities produce GIF images that do not conformto standards.  
        Such images will display empty outlines in place ofthe image.  
        These outlines are much larger than the actual images.The images
        will not be visible at all.<P>To repair these GIF images,content 
        providers can read the offending GIF image into adifferent GIF 
        utility that conforms to the GIF89a specifications,and save the 
        image again.<P>

       and News in addition to the Web Browser window. The selected encoding will be
       applied to enable viewing of documents of different encodings (e.g. Japanese)
       provided the user's system supports fonts for that locale. <P> 
</UL>

<H4>META Tag Extension for MIME Charset Info</H4>

<UL>
   <LI> The IETF draft on Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup
        Language proposes an extension to the HTML META tag to allow
        MIME charset information to be contained in the HTML document:<p>
        &ltMETA HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; 
        charset=ISO-2022-JP"&gt
   <LI> This support is in Navigator 2.0 and the MIME charset values
        supported includes all the charsets mentioned above in the section
        on "Additional Languages and MIME Charsets Supported.
</UL>

<H4>Document Encoding User Interface</H4>

<UL>
   <LI>Document Encoding Defaults are now easier to change.  Previous
       releases provided a preference panel to globally set the
       default character encoding of incoming documents.<P>
   <LI>Navigator 2.0 makes the default selection more accessible by
       moving it to the "Options | Document Encoding->" menu item. <P>
   <LI>Document encoding defaults are no longer global, so that a
       user may have multiple browser windows open in different
       default encodings (e.g., Japanse in one and French in another).<P>
   <LI>Users who want to regularly view documents in encodings other than
       Latin1 should use the Options | Document Encoding menu item to 
       choose the encoding, then select Options | Save Options to 
       make it the default setting. For example, Japanese users will 
       want to select Japanese (Auto-detect) from the Document 
       Encoding list, then choose Save Options. <P>
   <LI>User Defined encoding is available for encodings that we have
       not yet added support.

      <H3>Security Improvements</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Technical Background:</B><P>
       Netscape Navigator uses random information to generate 
       sessionencryption keys. The random information is found 
       through a variety offunctions that look into a user's machine
       for information.  Previousreleases of Netscape Navigator were
       subject to potential vulnerabilitiesbecause the size of random
       input was less than the size of thesubsequentkeys. This means 
       that instead of searching through all the 2^128possiblekeys by 
       brute force, a potential intruder only had to search through 
       asignificantly smaller key space by brute force.<P>Netscape 
       Navigator 2.0 incorporates fixes to the specific portionof our
       software where this potential vulnerability existed. We 
       havesignificantly increased the amount of random informationfrom
       approximately 30 bits to approximately 300 bits. Netscape
       has greatly expanded the techniques and sources used to generate
       these amounts of random information and the fixes have been 
       reviewed and validated by several weeks of intensive testing
       on the Internet.<P>
   <LI><B>Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security
       oftheirtransactions:</B><P>
       <UL><LI>If the attacker has physical access to your machine,
               securitycannot be assured.<P>
           <LI>Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents
               can log intoyour machine, little can be secure. For 
               secure servers, any insecureconnection mechanism could 
               be suspect. Multi-user UNIX platforms willnot be as secure
               as single-user machines.<UL>Details: Some of the system 
               specific information that is used in theseed generation
               is available to any user on that system.
       </UL><P>
   <LI>To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed
       intothe seed generation algorithm. Wary users can alter their 
       user environmentbefore running Netscape software. <P>
   <LI>If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, 
       they canpretty much do anything.<P>
   <LI>Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator.
       Use aversion native to the platform on which you are running.
       <UL>Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation 
           depends uponthe unpredictability of the low order bits
           of various clocks and timers.  The clocks of many emulators
           may have much less entropy than the actualbuiltin clocks. 
       </UL><P>
   <LI>If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the 
       security ofyour X server. This is also true if the X connection
       is not to a localmachine as all of the events and the data from
       the screen read may becaptured from the ethernet.
       <UL>Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input 
           then itsrandomness is not useful.
       </UL><P>
   <LI>It is better to perform some user action before connecting
       to asecuresite. This means you should not set your home page 
       to a secure site orlaunch your client from a command line 
       to a secure site.
       <UL>Details: While navigating through menus or typing into 
           various formfields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability 
           of details of the useractions to increase the entropy of 
           the RNG state.

    <LI> The selectedIndex property of SELECT popups is always
         the number of options, not the selected option's index.
    <LI> The INPUT focus() and select() force focus into an
         input tag and select its contents, respectively,
         but they don't display the usual visual cues such as
         insertion caret and highlighting.
    <LI> The window.close() method is not yet implemented.
    <LI> Operating on a closed window may crash.
    <LI> You can't call a function in another frame or window.

    <LI> &ltSCRIPT SRC=...&gt is not yet implemented.
</UL>

<H3>Java problems with the 32bit Navigator:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI> Java will not run using the 32bit Trumpet Winsock.  If you want to use
        trumpet winsock with the navigator, java must be disabled.
   <LI> Java requires at least a 256 color video driver.  If you want to use the
        navigator with less than 256 colors, java must be disabled.
   <LI> The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text it can display.
        Once the window fills up, it must be cleared before new text will appear.
   <LI> java.lang.Math.IEEERemainder(...) returns incorrect results.
   <LI> In order for a Date object to display the timezone (ie. PST) the TZ
        environment variable must be set (for both NT and Win95).
   <LI> The AWT File Dialog box is not implemented.  An exception is thrown if
        you try to create a java.awt.FileDialog object.
   <LI> The java.util.Date object is broken.
   <LI> The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes.
   <LI> Applet audio sometimes doesn't work correctly on NT systems.
</UL>

<H3>Known bugs in International support.</H3>
<UL>
   <LI> If Navigator used on a machine using Japanese Windows 
        locale, the text on several buttons in the Options | General
        Preferences | Fonts dialog box will misdisplay. The names 
        of the fonts may also misdisplay. However, the font functionality
        is unaffected. They will display correctly when viewing
        documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document
        encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, 
        and the document you are viewing was encoded using that character set).
   <LI> Entering multibyte characters in forms is not implemented in this release.
