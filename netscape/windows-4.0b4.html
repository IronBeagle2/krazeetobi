PR 4 includes support for object signing. Among other things, object signing
allows you to control the extent of the access that a particular Java program
has to your system. For example, you can choose to allow a signed Java
applet the access typically required by a word processor without granting
it other forms of access, such as making network connections. When an applet
requests access that you have not previously granted to the entity that
signed the applet, a dialog box appears that describes the request and
allows you to grant or deny that form of access.

<P>Netscape defines several different kinds of access that signed Java code
can request. To help you evaluate the potential danger posed by the particular
form of access that an applet or other Java code is requesting, Netscape
has also created a classification system based on three levels of risk.
You may have a different opinion of the level of risk that a particular
kind of access entails. These risk levels are provided as general guidelines
only. Be sure to read the description of the access requested by a particular
applet and make your own decision.

<P>Netscape's current classification system is based on these categories:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>High risk.</B> A major security attack is possible, permitting severe
damage to your system or data. Major violation of privacy is possible,
such as reading any information from hard disks connected to your computer.
Very significant services may be requested, such as establishing a connection
over the network to a remote computer.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Medium risk.</B> Major violation of privacy is possible, such as reading
any information from a hard disk connected to your computer. Some significant
services may be requested, such as writing files on a hard disk or sending
email on behalf of the user.</LI>

<BR><B>Low risk.</B> Minor violation of privacy is possible, such as reading
your user ID. Relatively minor services may be requested, such as writing
a single file to a specified noncritical directory on a hard disk connected
to your computer.</UL>

release notes for the JAR Packager, which are at: <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/relnotes.html">http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/relnotes.html</A></UL>

<H3>
Known Problems</H3>

<UL>
<H3>
Java</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
In the 16-bit product, Java is not enabled when running on a Windows NT
platform.&nbsp; It is enabled when running that product on a Windows 3.1
platform (the normal case), as well as on a Windows 95 platform.</LI>

<LI>
JSObject.getWindow requires an applet as an argument.</LI>

<LI>
toLocaleString()method in Date Class throws security exceptions.</LI>

<LI>
Classes loaded from CLASSPATH are no longer privileged.</LI>

<LI>
FileInputStream object's available method fails.</LI>

<LI>
JDK 1.1 packages missing in this beta include java.math and sun.rmi.</LI>

<LI>
The java.security package is unsupported.</LI>

<LI>
Signed Classes and the netscape.security.Target objects. Although the targets</LI>

<BR>"UniversalFileRead" and "UniversalFileWrite" are fully implemented
for the signed classes and the netscape.security.Target objects, the paramater
targets "FileRead" and "FileWrite," used for individual file access grants,
are not supported in this release.</UL>

<H3>
JavaScript</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
New Behavior</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Multi-byte character-set encodings (such as Shift-JIS) can be passed through
JavaScript either as string literals or with LiveConnect to and from Java,
but manipulation within JavaScript is dangerous since built-in methods
do not recognize multi-byte encodings.</LI>

<LI>
In a frame, history.back, history.forward, and history.go(n) manipulate
the frame's local history, not the full history of the entire Navigator
window that the Back button manipulates.</LI>

<LI>
In addition to loading system classes, JavaScript can now load Java classes
located at the same URL as the page.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Unload</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The unload event is not cancelable with a 'return false' from within the
onUnload event handler.</LI>

<LI>
Closing a window does not send an unload event to that window.</LI>

<LI>
In nested frames, the unload event is handled only by the top-level window.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Resizing of windows</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
You can enter a race condition with JavaScript that is currently writing
to the window.</LI>

<LI>
Plain text written using document.write() sometimes changes to HTML text
on resize.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Blur</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Using window.alert inside onBlur handlers can create infinite loops.</LI>

<LI>
After reloading a page, blur() on a field may not disable input to the
field.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Form elements</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
When focus is given from a form field to the top level window, then back
to the form element, the form's onFocus handler does not always get called.</LI>

<LI>
In scripts not tagged JavaScript1.2, hidden form elements may not reflect
correctly in a page with hidden and visible elements, with and some without
handlers.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
LiveConnect</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
When JavaScript code called from Java encounters an error, the error may
be reported&nbsp; to Java in future calls to JavaScript.</LI>

<LI>
JavaScript can halt if it attempts to call a nonexistent Java method.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
The onSelect event handler is not working.</LI>

<LI>
The Image onAbort event handler does not work correctly in frames.</LI>

<LI>
You must include new when calling Java constructors from JavaScript. For
example, var size = new java.awt.Dimension (...)</LI>

<LI>
document.write does not work correctly when used inside JavaScript entities.
For example, &amp; followed by {....}.</LI>

<LI>
SCRIPT tags inside FRAMESET tags are not executed.</LI>

<LI>
Scripts longer than 30,000 characters do not work on Win16. When a script
outside the URL in the location object tries to call methods of the location
object, access is always denied.</LI>

<LI>
On Win32 platforms, Number(x) incorrectly returns 0 when x is a string
that does not contain a well-formed numeric literal. On other platforms,
it correctly returns NaN.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Layering and absolute positioning</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Layer stacking order is not preserved across window/frame resize.</LI>

<LI>
Negative values for the Z-INDEX attribute on LAYER and ILAYER tags are
not recognized.</LI>

<LI>
Clicking on a link in a SRC layer, where the link has no TARGET attribute,
causes the target page to be loaded into the top-level&nbsp; window,&nbsp;
instead of replacing the layer.&nbsp; It is not possible to target URLs
at layers as with frames and the back/forward buttons do not work with
layers.</LI>

<LI>
It is not possible to use #URLs (named anchors) as the value for a LAYER's
SRC attribute.&nbsp; Also, links to named anchors from a link within a
layer may not work properly.</LI>

<LI>
The new width and height properties added to the document object may conflict
with user-defined variables of the same name. It is recommended that scripts
containing these properties be modified to use differently-named variables
or that the var keyword is used to declare such variables before they are
used to eliminate the conflict.</LI>

<LI>
Changing the contents of a layer (calling the load method, setting the
src property, calling document.open/write/close) has certain restrictions:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
They cannot be done while the main document is still loading.</LI>

<LI>
Only one layer can be changed at a given time. Changes to multiple layers
must be done serially. You can use the onLoad event handler for layers
to achieve the required serialization.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
The "Find in Page" feature does not work for layers.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
Style Sheets</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The use of negative margins to overlap text can cause very unpredictable
results and is not recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Use CSS positioning or layers to overlap text.</LI>

<LI>
Negative margin values are only allowed for margin-top and margin-bottom.</LI>

<LI>
Do not use pixel units. Because of variances of fonts among operating systems
(PC, MAC and UNIX) most fonts will not have the exact same pixel dimensions.&nbsp;
The use of relative units, epecially EMs which are based on the current
size of the font, regardless of which font actually gets selected, is highly
recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Assigning styles to the &lt;LI> tag only effect the bullet not the text
as it should.&nbsp; To work around the problem enclose the text with a
&lt;SPAN> tag or assign the style to the &lt;UL> or &lt;OL> tag.</LI>

<LI>
Sizing images using style sheets is disabled</LI>

<LI>
Following their original web design, tables do not inherit styles from
the surrounding text or style sheet.</LI>

<LI>
You cannot assign most styles to the &lt;TABLE> or &lt;TR> elements. Use
the &lt;TD> element instead.&nbsp; Exceptions are: background image and
color on the &lt;TABLE> tag which work as expected. For other styles, results
may vary depending on the complexity of the table and their use is not
recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Small-caps and obliqe font styles are not supported</LI>

<LI>
Postioning of empty tag elements (eg images) is not supported</LI>

<LI>
Dotted and dashed border styles are not supported.</LI>

<LI>
Border colors and styles can only be applied to all four sides at once
via the border-color and border-style properties. They cannot be set on
a per side basis.</LI>

<LI>
The vertical-align property only applies to replaced elements and does
not support percentage units, sub, or super.</LI>

<LI>
The background property inherits into text elements.&nbsp; Apply a "background-color
: transparent" if you do no want inheritance.</LI>

<LI>
Unsupported CSS attributes include:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
word-spacing and letter-spacing</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;first-line and first-letter styles</LI>

<LI>
list-style-image and list-style-position</LI>

<LI>
white-space: no-wrap</LI>

<LI>
font-variant&nbsp; (see small-caps above)</LI>

<LI>
!important</LI>

<LI>
background-attachment and background-position</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
In order to make pixel units print sensibly when going to high resolution
printers, pixel units are scaled to a virtual display resolution of&nbsp;
120dpi.&nbsp; What this means is that when going to a 300dpi printer, fonts
that are specified as being 12px high will be output as 30px or 7.2pts
which is how they would appear on a screen with a 120dpi resolution.&nbsp;
This is consistant with how pixel units specified via HTML tags (for example
&lt;table width=100>) are scaled.&nbsp; This scaling will not cause fonts
to have jagged edges since the font will be printed at the full 300dpi
resolution at 7.2pts.&nbsp; All other related pixel units (line-height,
margins, etc.) are scaled as well.</LI>

</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Browsing or displaying Unicode pages/mail/news (UTF-7, UTF-8, UCS-2) is
now supported for many languages. Communicator can use appropriate font
glyphs matching the Unicode code points from the user's local fonts. New
encoding menu items, UTF-7 and UTF-8 have been added. Though not in the
encoding menus, UCS-2 auto detection is supported.</LI>

<LI>
Unicode support includes Western, Eastern European, Cyrillic, Greek, Chinese,
Korean, Japanese, and Turkish. It does not include bi-directional and complex-ligature
languages.</LI>

<LI>
Communicator supports official IANA MIME Charset names. Improperly labeled
pages, e.g. 'euc-kr' as 'ks_c_5601-1987', 'big5' as 'x-x-big5', and 'gb2312'
as 'gb_2312-80', may not display properly.</LI>

<LI>
US Windows 95/NT users can now display Chinese, Japanese, and Korean pages/mail/news
if appropriate fonts are installed. A native OS (such as Japanese Windows
95) is not required for display. If you use native Windows 95/NT systems
such as Japanese Windows 95, you can display other Asian languages, e.g.
Chinese and Korean, with appropriate fonts.</LI>

<LI>
The input in CJK does require appropriate native OS's or equivalents.</LI>

<LI>
In Windows 95/NT, it is no longer necessary to make registry modifications
to use Unicode fonts. Communicator can now use appropriate native or Unicode
fonts automatically.</LI>

<LI>
Communicator can use many different language fonts as long as they adhere
to TrueType font specifications. Some public domain fonts which do not
follow them therefore may not work well with Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
Dynamic Fonts (Webfonts) can now display multi-byte languages. Dynamic
fonts allow web page designers to create font objects from local fonts
and use them to display prepared pages exactly as designed.</LI>

<LI>
Encoding menu names have been standardized across all platforms and products.</LI>

<LI>
All Unicode conversions are now based on Unicode Standard 2.0.</LI>

<LI>
NCR (Numeric Character References) and NE (Named Entities) display properly
if the character in question is available in the chosen encoding. NCR's
are interpreted as Unicode code points in the decimal format following
the standards in RFC 2070. If the corresponding character does not exist
in the chosen encoding, then "?" will be displayed.</LI>

<LI>
Many new languages have been added in the Accept-Language Preferences Window
for convenience. Accept-Language option is used to indicate the user's
preferred language(s) when sending requests to HTTP servers, which in turn
can use this information to send back documents matching the user's preferences.</LI>

<LI>
Communicator now automatically sends out Accept-Charset indicating the
user's system default character set and UTF-8 as 'minimally' acceptable
character sets. Accept-Charset information may be used to improve communication
between Communicator and directory servers by providing the servers the
information on what character sets Communicator can accept from them. No
UI is available to change this.</LI>

<LI>
Japanese automatic encoding detection has been improved, particularly for
EUC.</LI>

<LI>
Korean browsing now features automatic encoding detection between ISO-2022-KR
and EUC-KR.</LI>

<LI>
Users can now display all Cyrillic encodings with Windows Cyrillic (CP1251)
fonts. (E.g. KOI8-R fonts are not needed to display KOI8-R pages.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<B>Composer</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The HTML Composer now automatically adds character set information to the
edited document in the form of a Meta Charset attribute within the &lt;HEAD>
... &lt;/HEAD> tags.</LI>

<LI>
By default the Composer preserves the existing character encoding when
saving a document. However, the user can also change it if so desired.
(For Japanese, saving into ISO-2022-JP (JIS) is not supported. For Korean,
saving into ISO-2022-KR is not supported.)</LI>

<LI>
Multilingual UTF-8 pages can now be composed using Windows multilingual
keyboard IME's and Asian IME's. Copy/paste and drag/drop from/to different
encodings are possible between Composer and Browser windows. This editing
function is currently not available between multiple Composer windows.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<B>Messenger/Collabra Discussion Groups</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
An encoding menu is now available in the new Mail Composer window. This
convenient feature allows users to easily change the encoding for each
message without going back to the Mail Folder window.</LI>

<LI>
You can now compose and send rich-text mail (HTML) in all the languages
supported.</LI>

<LI>
Searching and filtering in European /Asian languages in the local Mail
folders work properly except for European language search/filter in the
body of HTML mail.</LI>

<LI>
Searching and filtering in European /Asian languages are not currently
supported for directories in IMAP4 servers.</LI>

<LI>
Directory search with European/Asian strings is now supported.&nbsp; Communicator
converts the data sent to Directory Server to UTF-8 (Unicode), and converts
data received back to the current encoding.</LI>

<LI>
All Address Book /vCard fields such as First Name, Last Name, Nickname,
Company, etc. now accept input in European accented-characters and Chinese/Japanese/Korean
2-byte characters.</LI>

<LI>
You can enter European/Asian Nicknames or First Names in the "To: " field,
and they will be resolved to e-mail addresses from the Address Book entries.</LI>

<LI>
Searching in European /Asian languages is also supported in the local Address
Book.</LI>

<LI>
Korean mail messages are now transmitted using the 7-bit ISO-2022-KR encoding.
News articles are posted using the EUC-KR encoding. Currently, the same
message cannot be sent to both the mail and news servers except in the
8-bit EUC-KR. We recommend sending messages separately to the mail and
news servers in such a case.</LI>

<LI>
Cyrillic mail is sent out using KOI8-R encoding.</LI>

<LI>
You can now create and delete IMAP4 folder names in European and Asian
languages. There may still be a slight problem in handling certain CJK
characters, however.</LI>

<LI>
On NT4/NT3.5x, Communicator used to incorrectly insert the PST/PDT Time
Zone into the mail header when the user's Time Zone does not use Daylight/Summer
Saving time. For example, most Asian countries would be affected. This
problem is now fixed.</LI>

<LI>
Each folder within the Messenger Mailbox window or Collabra Discussion
Groups window can have a different encoding setting. For example, the user
may store mail messages in one language in one folder and those in another
language in another folder. When the user opens a folder, Communicator
will automatically switch to that folder's encoding. When multiple Mailbox/Newsgroup
folders are opened from Discussion Groups window, each window can have
its own encoding setting. For example, the user can have multiple Mail/Newsgroups
windows open at the same time, all with different encodings, and Communicator
will automatically switch the encoding setting to that of the current window.</LI>

<BR></UL>

<H3>
<B>Java/JavaScript</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Windows 95/NT Communicator can now display Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
strings in Java applets if the appropriate fonts are available on the system.
No registry changes are required to use Unicode fonts.</LI>

<LI>
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input is now possible in Java AWT TextArea
and TextField windows. Communicator does not provide its own input method,
and so the user's system must have native input methods for these languages.</LI>

<LI>
All the JDK 1.1 internationalization classes have been incorporated into
Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
Passing multi-byte text from Java to JavaScript and from JavaScript to
Java now works if the document encoding is correctly set to the source
encoding. JavaScript String functions do not handle multi-byte characters
correctly.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
Known Problems</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
UTF-8 page display under US Windows 95 may not work properly when the Windows
95 system has been installed using the 'Custom Install' option. In such
a case, re-installing the Windows 95 system under the "Typical" install
option should eliminate the problem. We are currently working on a simpler
solution.</LI>

<LI>
HTML Composer cannot save documents into ISO-2022-JP (Japanese) and ISO-2022-KR
(Korean).</LI>

<LI>
On Windows NT, Cyrillic/Greek/Turkish/Central European characters may not
display correctly in TextArea and Text Input for HTML FORM.</LI>

<LI>
When multi-frames are created by JavaScript, the 2nd or later pages may
be assigned a wrong charset. For example, a search result page may be generated
this way. In such a case, re-sizing the window or re-loading the frame
restores the correct display. Page designers can avoid this problem by
initially loading multi-frames using conventional HTML rather than by JavaScript.</LI>

<LI>
In cases where there is a mismatch between HTTP Charset from servers and
the document's own Meta Charset , the document's Charset Tag will predominate
when the document is re-loaded.</LI>

<LI>
Using View/Page Info may cause the original page to misdisplay when the
Page Info window is closed.</LI>

<LI>
Communicator supports only 1 encoding for multiple layers.</LI>

<LI>
An Address Book/Mail Header name resolution may insert an equivalent of
ASCII backslash "\" in the display of certain Japanese and Chinese characters.
This is a cosmetic problem likely to occur only with Shift_JIS (Japanese)
and Big5 (Taiwan) encodings. E-mail address resolution should work all
right and messages can be sent.</LI>

<LI>
There may be a slight imperfection in the Address Book resolution when
there are multi-byte language entries.</LI>

<BR>In using Japanese IME's for HTML Editing/HTML Mail, Shift+Right_Arrow
key will not let users advance to the next parsing candidate. This is not
a problem in plain (non-HTML) mail.</UL>
