<LI>
This release has not been fully optimized for size or performance.
16 MB of RAM or more is recommended.</LI>

<LI>
If you install the 16-bit version of Communicator PR2 (Windows 3.1
or 3.11) in the same directory as previous versions of Communicator, the
previous versions are deleted. If you want to switch between versions while
evaluating the PR2 version, install Communicator PR2 in a new directory.
If you install in the same directory, do not run the deleted version's
Deinstaller program. You might have to re-install Communicator PR2.</LI>

<LI>
If you upgrade from Navigator 3.0 and select the Move Files options
during Profile Setup, copy the <TT>cookies.txt</TT> file in your new user
directory to your existing Navigator 3.x directory if you want the options
to work with Navigator 3.x. If you choose the Copy Files option, copy the
<TT>cookies.txt</TT> file from Navigator 3.x directory to your new user
directory if you want the options to work with Communicator PR2. The default
location for your new user directory is \Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;user
name&gt;.</LI>

<LI>
Help information is available on some, but not all, tasks and topics.
Minimum Install includes Help on some functions that are not provided with

<LI>
Plug-ins installed in previous versions of Navigator are not automatically
transferred to Communicator. Re-install these plug-ins.</LI>

<LI>
During installation, Communicator copies the address book from Navigator

import the address book file. To import address books, choose Import from
the File menu in the Address Book window. The address book is the file
<TT>address.htm</TT> in the user directory (the default is<B> </B>\Program
Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;user name&gt;).</LI>

<LI>
Several printing problems exist, including incorrect printing of images
and improper alignment on the page.</LI>

incorrectly.</LI>

<LI>
Some web counters are not displayed correctly in Communicator.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If you run Netscape Communicator PR1 after installing Netscape Communicator
PR2, you need to delete all the <TT>.snm</TT> files from your mail directory
(including those within subfolders) and the <TT>.sbd</TT> files. These
files will be rebuilt by PR2.</LI>

<LI>
Accessing About Netscape from the Help menu in the Message Center,
Message List window, or Message window might not display the information.
Go to the Navigator window and access About Netscape.</LI>

<LI>
In the Address Book, if you type a name in the type down field and
select it and press Delete, the name in the type down field is not deleted.
Instead, the highlighted address is deleted.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
The No Pages to Print error occurs if you have just scrolled down to
the bottom of a message. To workaround, scroll back to the top of the message.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
If you get a system halt when invoking the Compose window, rename <TT>abook.nab</TT>
(Address Book file) located in your Users Profile directory.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Some Preference settings are not completely implemented. In such cases,
this release uses the settings from Netscape Navigator 3.x.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
When using the Address Book or the Join Discussion Dialog, all the
columns might appear forced to the left. Click on the &lt; and &gt; buttons
in the column heading area to correct this problem.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
The Add to Address Book button in the Search Directory dialog does
not work. Selected names are not added to the Address Book. Access the
LDAP Search feature from within the Address Book, select the desired name,
and choose to compose a message. Copy the address, and then from the Address
Book, add a new user and paste the address in the specified field.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Shortcut keys might not bring up the correct dialog or perform the
correct action for Windows NT 3.51.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
When opening the Message window, some extraneous characters are displayed.
This can be ignored.</LI>

<LI>
The default values for the Disk Space tab in Mail and Discussions Preferences
are not optimally set. If using these options, specify the values you wish
to use.</LI>

<LI>
The Next Folder and Next Unread Folder commands under the Go menu within
the Message List window and the Message window are not working.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Ctrl-Enter Accelerator - This accelerator key for sending messages
is not working. Use the Send toolbar button to send your messages.</LI>

<LI>
In the Mail and Discussions Preferences, Identity section, include
a valid user name and domain name in the E-mail field (for example, johndoe@company.com).
If you do not include the domain name, a system halt might occur when composing
with the HTML Composer.</LI>

<B>Messenger</B>&nbsp;</DT>

<UL>
<LI>
After you get new messages, the message you had selected before downloading
stays current. To get to the first new (unread) message, click Next Unread
on the toolbar.</LI>

<LI>
If Communicator has not accessed a mail folder (and built a summary
file for it internally), a mail filter using that folder might not correctly
filter messages to that folder. The messages appear in your Inbox rather
than in the designated folder.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Setting Priority of Outgoing Mail - You can set the priority of outgoing
mail under the third tab in the Composition window. You must reselect the
addressing tab prior to sending the message, otherwise the priority reverts
back to Normal.</LI>

<H3>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Mail with IMAP Servers</FONT></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
You can access IMAP4 Servers with this version of Communicator. Synchronization
of on-line and off-line mail folders has not yet been implemented.</LI>

<LI>
If you accessed an IMAP server in Communicator PR1, a directory/mail
folder named IMAPMailboxes appears after you log in to a IMAP server. The
directory structure has changed for this release and you can delete the
folders in the IMAPMailboxes folder or move them elsewhere.</LI>

<LI>
After switching between IMAP and POP servers, you should exit and restart
the application.</LI>

<LI>
You can specify a directory for your IMAP folders. Set this preference
in Mail and Discussions preferences under the Mail Server tab. Click More
and set the IMAP mail directory.</LI>

<LI>
You can delete IMAP folders from the Message Center by dragging them
to the trash and emptying the trash.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
If you mark all messages Read or Catch up by Date, the next time you
get new messages, those messages become unread again.&nbsp; Manually mark
each message as Read by selecting each one or clicking on the green unread
indicator in the Message List window.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
After getting new mail from the Inbox, the message list pane scrolls
back to the top of the list.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Mail filters are supported on server folders in IMAP mode, but not
for local folders.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
After you create a folder, it will not appear in the Message Center
until you close and reopen the Message Center.</LI>

<LI>
From the Message Center, the File|Empty Trash Folder menu item is enabled
after you select a mail folder in the Message Center. Emptying Trash empties
both your online Trash folder, as well as your local Trash folder (POP
server), if one exists.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Ignore the error message that appears when you cancel the password
dialog . To get the password dialog again and to re-enter your password,
close and reopen the Message List window.</LI>

<LI>
Searching all mail folders does not find items located in an online
folder.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
You might not get a login prompt when you open your Inbox. The Inbox
window appears, the Netscape logo is animated, but you are not prompted
for your password. To avoid this problem, do not bring up the Message Center
from Collabra|Discussions, but instead use the Message Center from the
menu. You can also select another IMAP folder from the folder drop-down
list in the Inbox. This causes the login dialog to appear. Log in and switch
to the Inbox folder.</LI>

<LI>
MIME HTML messages (mail with embedded images) does not display properly
when read with IMAP.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Searching Discussion Messages command is case-sensitive.</LI>

<LI>
Composing a message to a discussion group with the Compose menu item
(and not using To: Discussion from within the discussion group) sends the
message to the default server. An error message occurs if the discussion
group is not on your default server. The workaround is to compose a message
from within the Discussion Group so that the To: Discussions toolbar or
menu item is available.</LI>

<LI>
For discussion group messages, the Mark Read toolbar button and corresponding
menu items within the Message window are disabled. You can mark items read
(or unread) from the Message List window.</LI>

<LI>
When you switch to the Message Center with the Communicator|Collabra
Discussions menu item or access any of the Discussion Hosts in the Message
Center, you might get a reminder that new discussion groups are available.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
If you want to get a new message in discussion groups, close and reopen
the discussion group.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<FONT SIZE=+0>Categories within Discussion Groups on Beta Collabra
Server</FONT></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
You can access categories created on Beta Collabra Server 3.0, which
supports category creation. The Message List window shows the categories
in the upper left pane.</LI>

<LI>
The unread count displayed in the Message Center for discussion groups
containing categories displays &quot;1&quot; as the count. Open the discussion
group to view the actual unread count for each category in the discussion
group.</LI>

<LI>
If you have the Message List window set to display the upper pane,
it automatically switches to display the message pane (bottom) when you
select a category.</LI>

<LI>
Occasionally, a duplicate category might appear. Close and reopen the
discussion group to correct this problem.</LI>

<LI>
After switching between different discussion groups containing categories,
using the drop-down list in the Message List window might cause some selection

Netscape provides a central DLS server. You can run your own DLS server,
but if you do you are currently restricted to calling within your realm.</LI>

<LI>
A conference call maybe automatically initiated after clicking OK in
the Call Preferences window.&nbsp; This&nbsp; occurs only if the options
for the name of the DLS server are changed or the publish Name option is
changed. All subsequent times that the Call Preference window is accessed
and closed with the OK button, initiates a call to the last person you
conferenced.&nbsp; Closing and restarting the conference application resolves
the problem.</LI>

<LI>
Canceling a call initiated through the web phone book might cause the
person being called to crash if they have Auto answer selected. Let the
call connect and then hang up.</LI>

<LI>
Answering or placing calls causes a system halt and terminates the
application. (Windows NT 3.51)&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
Selecting the web phone book when a Navigator window is already open

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Add a Collabra/news server and subscribe to discussion groups -
</B>use<B> </B>the Join Discussions from the File menu in the Netscape
Message Center folder window. For more information on how to search for
and subscribe to discussion groups, choose Help Contents from the Help
menu.</LI>

<LI>
<B>New windows</B>:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Folder window</B>: displays the Netscape Message Center, which contains
lists of mail folders and discussion groups to which you subscribe</LI>

<LI>
<B>Message List window</B>: displays the contents of a mail folder
or discussion group, and provides a collapsible message area in which you
can view a selected message</LI>

<LI>
<B>Message window</B>: displays the content of a selected message</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>Reusable windows - </B>When opening mail folders, discussion groups,
and messages, Communicator reuses the Message List or Message window you
currently have open, instead of opening a new window</LI>

<LI>
<B>One- or two-pane display in message list window - </B>The Message
List window has a collapsible message area, which you can use to view a
message you select from the message list</LI>

<LI>
<B>New mail icon - </B>The Inbox icon on the task bar indicates when
you have new mail on your server. Opening your Inbox no longer downloads
new messages. To receive new messages, click the Get New Messages button
on the toolbar.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Mail Notification</B> <B>application</B> - To launch this feature,
run Netscape Mail Notification from your Communicator program folder. This
notification runs minimized on the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 task bar.
To set up this mail notification, right mouse click on the mail notification
icon in the task bar. You can check to see if you have new mail (without
having Communicator loaded) or run mail directly from this icon. This mail
notification program remains loaded unless you exit by using the right
mouse menu. This feature does not work when your mail is set up for an
IMAP4 server.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Reuse Message List and Message Windows</B> - There is an option
to reuse the Message List and Message windows or open a new window when
another folder, discussion or message is selected. You can set this option
from Mail and Discussions Preferences, Mail and Discussions tab. The option
is &quot;Reuse thread and message window&quot; and &quot;Reuse message
window.&quot;</LI>

<LI>
<B>One or Two Pane Display in Thread Window</B> - There is an option
to show the message contents from the Message List window (two panes) or
to show just the threads (one pane). You can set from Mail and Discussions
Preferences, in the Mail &amp; Discussions tab. The option is &quot;show
message in thread window by default.&quot; You can also switch between
one or two panes by clicking on the blue arrow toggle shown in the left
side of the window below the end of the thread list.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Next Unread</B> - Next Unread spans across mail folders and&nbsp;
discussion groups&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Backtrack and Forward</B> - Backtrack is a feature, available from
the Go menu, that takes you to the messages that you have just read. Forward,
available from the Go menu, takes you to the messages you've backtracked
from.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Inbox Icon in the Netscape Task bar </B>- Unlike Netscape Navigator
3.0x, displaying the Mail Inbox or the Netscape Message Center does not
automatically get new messages for you. To receive new messages, click
Get New Messages on the toolbar or the Message menu.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Filing or Copying Messages</B> - Instead of trying to display both
the Message window and a Message List window side by side to drag and drop
messages into folders, you can file (move) or copy messages directly from
the Message List window or from the Message window. Use the File toolbar
button to move messages into folders or use the commands from the Message
window. You can also file discussion group messages into folders that you
create to capture information you want to refer to later.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>&quot;More&quot; feature</B> - You can press the spacebar to read
through all your unread messages.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Send Later</B> - You can defer sending of your messages by choosing
the Send Later command under the Message menu. Choosing Send Later places
your message into the Outbox folder. You can send the outgoing messages
by choosing Message | Send in Outbox from the Netscape Message Center or
from the Outbox's Message List window when you are online.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Save Drafts</B> - You can save messages that you are in the process
of composing. From within the Composition window, click the Save Draft
toolbar button. You can continue composing your message and then send it.
Or, you can close the Composition window and then go into the Drafts folder
and select the draft you saved. Double-click the draft and the Composition
window appears for you to modify the message and send it.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Filters</B> - Filter support allow you to organize your incoming
messages. Use Mail Filter Rules in the Edit menu to create filters.&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
<B>Views</B> - You can display five different views in the Thread window.
They are: New, Threads with New, Watched, Ignored, and All. Use the Messages
command in the View menu to change views to one of these options:</LI>

<UL><B>Threads with New</B> - Only unread messages appear. If your messages
are sorted by thread and the unread message is a reply, the &quot;parent&quot;
of this reply also displays.&nbsp;
<BR><B>Watched</B> - Only new messages which belong to a thread that is marked
&quot;watched&quot; (using Watch Thread from the Message menu) appears
in this view. For example: When you only have time to read new messages
for the threads that you've marked watched, you can access those threads
directly by choosing the Watched view after getting new mail or opening
a discussion group.&nbsp;
<BR><B>Ignored</B> - All messages, including messages which belong to a thread
that is marked &quot;ignored&quot; (Ignore Thread command in the Message
menu)&nbsp; appear in this view.&nbsp;
<BR><B>All</B> - All messages, except ignored threads, appear in this view.&nbsp;
<BR>Note: When switching views, you may not see any changes because the views
are cached. If this occurs, use the &quot;All&quot; view and select another
message to clear the cache or close and reopen the folder or discussion
group.&nbsp;

<DT>
<B>New</B> - Only unread messages appear.</DT>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>Showing More Columns in the Thread Window</B> - Communicator defaults
to showing a specified set of columns in the Netscape Message Center and
the Netscape Message List window. You can increase or decrease the number
of columns shown by clicking on the &lt; or &gt; buttons at the right of
the column headings.&nbsp;</LI>
