<H3>General Features</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>New Directory buttons:</b> The directory button toolbar now
includes Destinations and People. Net Directory and Handbook have
been removed.
<P>
<li><b>New Directory menu items:</b> The Directory menu now has items
for Netscape Destinations and People. Internet Directory and Internet
White Pages have been removed.
<P>
<li><b>New Navigation for Frames and the <b>Back</b> button:</b> Now,
when you click on a link that updates a frame, pressing the
<b>Back</b> button returns you to the previous state of the frame.
Previously, pressing the <b>Back</b> button ignored updates within a
page's frames and always returned you to the previous whole
page (further back than you probably wanted). In short, navigating
among frames now works on a per frame basis: pressing <b>Back</b>
revisits the previous frame and pressing <b>Forward</b> revisits the
frame ahead.
<P>
<li><b>Three-pane configurability:</b> A pane layout option has been
added to the <b>Mail and News|Appearance</b> panel (choose the
<b>Options|Mail and News Preferences|Appearance</b> menu item). The
panel offers radio buttons to designate the layout of the three panes
in the Mail and News windows. Choose <b>Split Horizontal</b>
(<b>Articles on top</b> on Macintosh) to align the message content
pane to the right of the two split panes. Choose <b>Split
Vertical</b> (<b>Articles on left</b> on Macintosh) to align the
message content pane below the two split panes. Choose <b>Stack</b>
(<b>Stacked</b> on Macintosh) to align the message content pane below
the two stacked panes (layered in rows atop one another).
<P>
<li><b>Show recipient in Sent Folder and Outbox:</b> When you select
a mail folder by clicking on it, the message heading pane displays
the titles of messages contained in that folder. In previous
versions, you'd always see the title <b>Sender</b> above a column
that shows the name of the sender of the mail message. Now, in the
Outbox and Sent Mail folders, you'll see the title <b>Recipient</b>
instead of </b>Sender</b>, and the column shows the email address of
the mail recipient. For sent mail, the recipient info is much more
useful than the sender info (typically yourself).
<P>
<li><b>Compressed headers:</b> When viewing either the Mail or
News window, the <b>Options</b> menu now offers a cascading
(hierarchical) menu items called <b>Show Headers</b> that replaces
the <b>Show All Headers</b> item. The new menu item gives you more
options to control the number of header information fields displayed
when viewing messages. <b>All</b> displays all possible header
fields. <b>Normal</b> displays the primary address fields.
<b>Brief</b> displays only subject and recipient fields.
<P>
<li><b>Netscape Navigator Gold:</b> Netscape Navigator Gold has been
updated for Win32 and Mac. Gold now lets you edit tables.
<P>
<li><b>New Network preferences panels:</b> New Network|Protocols and
Network|Languages preference panels to expand and improve user
preferences for security and privacy control.
<P>
<li><b>POP3 servers:</b> The <b>Keep Mail on Server</b> and <b>Maximum
Message Size</b> options now work even with POP3 servers that do not
implement the UIDL command.
<P>
<li><b>Special characters:</b> Additional entity names such as
"&amp;pound" are now implemented.
</ul>
<P>

<A NAME="Layout">
<H3>Layout Features</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Frame Border Control:</B> The FRAMEBORDER attribute can be set
in the <b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> tag or the <b>&lt;FRAME&gt;</b> tag.
The attribute can have the value of "yes" or "no". The default is
"yes". When used in the <b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> tag this attribute
sets the default value for all frames in that frameset. When used in
the <b>&lt;FRAME&gt;</b> tag, it sets the presence of borders
explicitly for that frame, overriding any already set frameset
attributes. Because borders are shared between frames. A border will
only be turned off if all the frames sharing it have their
FRAMEBORDER attribute set to "no".
<P>
The BORDER attribute can globally set the frame border thickness for
all frames in a frameset tag (on the outermost <b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;
</b> only; not on a per-frame basis). Setting <b>BORDER</b>=>0
implicitly sets <b>FRAMEBORDER</b>="no".
<P>
The BORDERCOLOR attribute sets border color in the
<b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> tag or the <b>&lt;FRAME&gt;</b> tag. This
attribute sets a color name or RGB value to be used as the color for
frame borders. When used in the <b>&lt;FRAME&gt;</b> tag, it
attempts to set the colors of that frames borders. When used in the
<b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> tag, it attempts to set the colors of all
borders of all frames in the frameset.
<p>
Because frame borders are shared, border color conflicts are resolved
as follows: The attribute appearing in the outer
<b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> has the lowest priority. This is in turn
overridden by the attribute used in a nested <b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b>
tag. Finally, the <b>BORDERCOLOR</b> attribute used in a
<b>&lt;FRAME&gt;</b> tag overrides all previous
<b>&lt;FRAMESET&gt;</b> tag uses. If there is a conflict for two
colors of equal priority both set on the same edge, the behavior is
undefined.
<P>
<li><B>Multi-Column Text:</B> The <b>&lt;MULTICOL&gt;</b> tag is a
container, and all the HTML between the starting and ending tag will
be displayed in a multi-column format. The tag can be nested,
although multi-column text within multi-column text becomes quickly
unreadable. The attributes of this tag are <b>COLS</b>,
<b>GUTTER</b>, and <b>WIDTH</b>.
<P>
The COLS attribute is <b>mandatory</b> and controls how many columns
the display will be split into. Layout will attempt to flow elements
evenly across the columns to make each column have about the same
height. Unless the <b>WIDTH</b> attribute is specified, column with
is adjusted to fill the available view.
<P>
The GUTTER attribute controls the pixels of space between columns. It
defaults to a value of <tt>10</tt>.
<P>
The WIDTH attribute controls the width of an individual column. All
columns are always the same width, so the overall width of a
multi-column layout is:<br> <tt>(cols * width) + ((cols - 1) *
gutter)</tt><br>
<P>

<li><B>Horizontal and Vertical Spacing:</B> A new tag called
<b>&lt;SPACER&gt;</b> provides better control over the spacing of
objects and whitespace in HTML pages. The
attributes to spacer are <b>TYPE</b>, <b>SIZE</b>, <b>WIDTH</b>,
<b>HEIGHT</b>, and <b>ALIGN</b>.
<P>
The TYPE attribute has three possible values: horizontal,
vertical, and block. These correspond to the three
types of spacing control delineated above. The default value
is horizontal.
<UL>
<LI>The horizontal spacer inserts horizontal space between words.
The width of the space is controlled by the <b>SIZE</b>
attribute.
<LI>The vertical spacer inserts vertical space between lines.
Implicit in this spacer is a line break to end the current
line, then the vertical space is added before the beginning of the
next line. The height of the space is controlled by the <b>SIZE</b>
attribute.
<LI>The block spacer behaves almost exactly like an invisible image.
When using this type of spacer the <b>SIZE</b> attribute is ignored,
and instead the <b>WIDTH</b>, <b>HEIGHT</b>, and <b>ALIGN</b> attributes
are applied just as they would be for the <b>&lt;IMG&gt;</b> tag.
</UL>
<P>
The SIZE attribute only applies when the spacer has a type
of horizontal or vertical. Then this attribute controls the
absolute width or height in pixels of the spacing added.
<P>
The WIDTH attribute only applies when the spacer is of
type block. Then this attribute controls the
absolute width in pixels of the spacing rectangle added.
<P>
The HEIGHT attribute only applies when the spacer is of
type block. Then this attribute controls the
absolute height in pixels of the spacing rectangle added.
<P>
The ALIGN attribute only applies when the spacer is of
type block. Then this attribute controls the
alignment of the spacing rectangle in exactly the same way
it would control the alignment of an <b>&lt;IMG&gt;</b> tag.
<P>
<li><B>Strikeout and Underline Text:</B> Netscape has always
supported strikeout text in the form of the <b>&lt;STRIKE&gt;</b>
tag. Now Netscape also supports an alternative syntax, the
<b>&lt;S&gt;</b> tag, while maintaining support for the
<b>&lt;STRIKE&gt;</b> tag as backwards compatibility.
<p>
Netscape now supports underlined text using the <b>&lt;U&gt;</b> tag. 
The tag causes all text between the start and end tag to have a solid
underline drawn along the common baseline of the text.
<P>
<li><B>JavaScript Evaluation in HTML:</B> JavaScript evaluation in
HTML attribute values allows JavaScript to be dynamically evaluated
in the right-hand side of an HTML attribute name/value pair (that is,
when calculating the values of HTML attributes). This allows the
attributes of one HTML element to depend on information about
previously placed elements on the page.
<p>
JavaScript evaluation uses the HTML entity
sequence as follows:
<p>
<tt>&amp;lt; == "&lt;"</tt>
<p>
Where "&amp;" denotes the start of an entity, and ";" terminates
it. In this case a dynamic entity is in the
form of a JavaScript expression enclosed in curly braces:
<p>
<tt>&amp;{<i>javascript_expression</i>}; == "<i>returned_string</i>"</tt>
<p>
JavaScript entities concatenate with the surrounding text:
<p>
<tt>"&amp;{10 * 10};%" == "100%"</tt>
<p>
JavaScript entities can only be interpreted on the right-hand
side of HTML attribute name/value pairs.
<P>
<li><B>FONT FACE=fontName:</B> The FONT FACE attribute lets you specify the
names of specific fonts as your preferred font choices in the format:
<P>
<tt>&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;font1,font2,fontN&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;</tt>
<P>
For example, if font1 is not available, font2 is used. If no specified
font is available, the default font is used. COLOR and SIZE
attributes can be specified along with the FACE attribute.
<P>
<tt>&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Garamond,Helvetica,Times&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;</tt>
<P>
<li><b>Support table cell background colors:</b> You can specify a
background color to be used when displaying table cells. To specify a
table background color use the <b>bgcolor</b> attribute. Nested
tables inherit background colors.
<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 WIDTH=20%>
 <CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells</CAPTION>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffdddd>One Color</TD></TR>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ccffff>Another Color</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
The <b>bgcolor</b> tag specifies one of the supported color names and
can be used with the following tags: <b>table</b>, <b>td</b>,
<b>th</b>, and <b>tr</b>.
<P>
Here's the HTML that produced the table on
the right.
<br clear=all>
<XMP>
<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 WIDTH=20%>
 <CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells</CAPTION>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffdddd>One Color</TD></TR>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ccffff>Another Color</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</XMP>
<P>
</ul>

<A NAME="Message">
<H3>Message Composition and Viewing Improvements</H3>
<P>

<ul>
<li><B>Long-line Wrapping in Message Composition window:</b> The new
Message Composition window menu item <b>View|Wrap Long Lines</b>,
when checked, automatically line-wraps the messages you send such
that no line is longer than 72 characters. The width of the Message
Composition window does not affect line-wrapping, nor are the line
breaks you see necessarily the wrapping that is sent. When unchecked,
messages are sent without automatic line-wrapping and the line breaks
that you see are sent. The default is checked.
<P>
In previous versions, long lines were wrapped at the width of
the window. This gave a "What You See Is What You Get" aspect to
the message composition window. Regardless of whether the sender had
allowed text to auto-wrap, or had hit return at the end of
every line, or had resized the window, the recipient of the
message would see the same line breaks as the sender. 
<P>
However, problems occurred when senders made their composition windows
very wide for ease of editing. It was
very easy to accidentally send out messages with long lines that
exceeded the 80 column limit. To many recipients, such messages would
be very difficult to read.
<P>
In this version, outgoing text is wrapped at 72 columns, regardless of
the size of the window. This makes the composition window less
WYSIWYG, but it does make it much harder to accidentally generate
unreadable messages.
<P>
There is (and has been) a single exception to the line wrapping rule:
Lines which have the character <B><TT>&gt;</TT></B> as their first
character are never wrapped. Such lines are usually a part of quoted
text and it is important to preserve the special character at the start of each line.
<P>
It is also still true that lines beginning with <B><TT>&gt;</TT></B>
will appear to be wrapped in the Message Composition window if the
lines are longer than the window is wide. This is a property of the
platform-provided text editors. At the time the message is sent,
these lines will be effectively unwrapped.
<P>
Since the column at which word-wrapping occurs is no longer tied to
the size of the window, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option has been
added to turn off word-wrapping on the Message Composition window.
This is for the less common case where you need to send a message
with specially-formatted text such as wide tables or charts, or data
where wrapping the lines would damage the data.
<P>
When this option is selected, two things happen: First, the text
area no longer does word-wrapping (a horizontal scrollbar will be
presented instead). Second, the generated message will have
exactly the line breaks that the user inserted explicitly and no
automatic wrapping of any kind will occur.
<P>
The default for the option is to wrap lines and the option is not
persistent. If you turn wrapping off, the particular composition
window is affected only this one time (since no-wrapping is an
unusual case).
<P>

<li><B>Long-line Wrapping in Mail and News windows:</b> The new menu
item in the Mail and News windows <b>View|Wrap Long Lines</b>, when
checked, displays long lines in the message in shorter, more numerous
lines. When unchecked, long lines are more likely to extend off the
screen and require the horizontal scroll bar for viewing. The default
is unchecked.
<P>
Messages marked as <TT>text/plain</TT> should have preformatted line
breaks so that the text does not require reformatting or wrapping.
However, two forms of messages cause problems:
<P>
First, there are the messages which have line breaks at the end of
each line, but which have lines which are too long (say, 100
character lines rather than 79 character lines.) Such messages were
easy to generate with earlier versions of Netscape by simply making
the Message Composition window wider than its default size.
<P>
Second, there are the messages which only have line breaks at the end
of each paragraph. These messages are generated by software which
does not understand the requirements of Internet mail and
inappropriately assumes that the recipient of the message will always
be able to rewrap the messages.
<P>
To address both types of message, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option
has been added to the <B>View</B> menu on both the Mail and News
windows. This allows lines which are longer than the width of the
window to be wrapped. Turning this option on will probably make
correctly-formatted messages look worse, however, for messages which
are incorrectly formatted with overly long lines, the option makes
the messages readable.
<P>
Note that though there are now line-wrapping options on both the
Message Composition window, and on the Mail and News windows, they do very
different things. The former affects the actual text that will be
mailed out; the latter merely controls the presentation of
received messages without actually altering them.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME="MIME">
<H3>MIME Parser Improvements</H3>
<P>
The MIME message display engine has been significantly improved. A
number of new features have been added and a number of bugs have been
fixed.
<ul>
<LI><B>When saving attachments, a more reasonable default file name
will be used:</B> In earlier versions, the <B>Save This Link As</b>
command (and its shortcut, the shift-click or option-click gesture)
did not generally offer a good default file name when prompting for
the place to save the attachment. This is now fixed: the suggested
file name should always be the original name of the attached
document.
<P>
<LI><B>Support for uuencoded data in non-MIME messages is greatly
improved:</B> In previous versions of Netscape, uuencoded
pseudo-attachments were not handled as well as full-fledged MIME
attachments; the handling of uuencoded data in non-MIME messages
should now be virtually indistinguishable from real MIME attachments,
from the end user's point of view.
<P>
In previous versions, uuencoded data was automatically decoded only if
it appeared to be on of the built-in image types (GIF, JPEG, and
XBM); and once the uuencoded data was encountered, it was considered
to extend from the <TT>begin</TT> line to the end of the message.
This has been fixed:
<UL>
<P>
<LI>Any number of uuencoded segments in a message will be displayed
as attachments: the uuencoded data is considered to extend from the
<TT>begin</TT> to the <TT>end</TT> line, and then the
remainder of the message will be presented in the usual way. 

<P>
<LI>Any type of uuencoded data will be treated as an attachment, not just
images. If the extension on the name of the attached file is one that
indicates that it is a GIF, JPEG, or XBM, then the attachment will be
decoded and displayed inline; otherwise, it will be presented as a
normal attachment link, making it easy to decode and save the
data to a file. 

<P>
<LI>The <B>View Attachments as Links</B> menu item now affects
the presentation of uuencoded attachments in the same way it has
always affected MIME attachments.

<P>
<LI>When uuencoded attachments are saved, they will always be decoded
first, just as base64-encoded data is.
</UL>

<P>
<LI><B>BinHex data is recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> In
much the same way that we notice the presence of uuencoded data in
non-MIME messages, we now also notice BinHex data.

<P>
<LI><B>Sun MailTool attachments are supported:</B> Attachments of the
form generated by Sun's MailTool (messages of type
<TT>x-sun-attachment</TT>) are recognized, and displayed just like
normal MIME messages.

<P>
<LI><B>The multipart/alternative MIME type is supported:</B>
The <TT>multipart/alternative</TT> Content-Type is a container that
includes different versions of the same document; for example,
a <TT>text/plain</TT> version, followed by a <TT>text/html</TT>
version, followed by an <TT>application/postscript</TT> version.
Netscape will present to the user only one of the versions, the
highest ``resolution'' version that can be displayed inline.
<P>
Netscape does not currently have the ability to generate messages
which contain <TT>multipart/alternative</TT> data, but it is now
capable of displaying it (for compatibility with existing and future
mailers which do generate such messages.)

<P>
<LI><B>The message/external-body MIME type is supported:</B>
The <TT>message/external-body</TT> Content-Type is a MIME
representation of what is essentially a URL: it describes a method
for retrieving a document from the net. The directly-supported
<TT>message/external-body</TT> access methods are <TT>ftp</TT>,
<TT>anon-ftp</TT>, <TT>local-file</TT>, <TT>afs</TT>,
<TT>mail-server</TT>, and <TT>url</TT>.

<P>
<LI><B>Uuencoded data is only recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> We
no longer recognize uuencoded data in arbitrary parts of type
<TT>text/plain</TT>: we now only do this auto-<WBR>recognition in
messages which have no Content-Type specified. That is, if the
message is a full-fledged MIME message, we always believe the
Content-Type of that message. If it says it's plain text, then we
treat it as plain text and don't play guessing games behind its back.
<P>
However, if the message does not have a Content-Type, then it is
not a MIME message, and we assume that it may contain either text, or
uuencoded data, or BinHex data, or any combination thereof. 
<P>
So if you come across a message that contains uuencoded data, and we
did not present it as an attachment, then that's probably because
that message was generated by simply pasting the uuencoded data into
the main body of the message with a MIME-compliant mailer. 
<P>
The proper way to send uuencoded data with a MIME-compliant mailer is
to attach the uuencoded file to the message, so that it shows up as a
MIME part, with some non-text Content-Type, and <TT>x-uuencode</TT>
as its Content-Transfer-Encoding.
</ul>


<A NAME="Macintosh-only">
<H3>Macintosh-only Changes</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Open Transport native:</B> Native support for Apple Open Transport.
<P>
<li><B>Internet Config:</B> Basic Internet Config features are
supported. Internet Config is a public domain system extension that
lets you configure Internet information such as email address and
server names in a single source location. This is useful if you are
using multiple Internet applications. Supporting applications can
find this information, making it unnecessary for you to enter the
same information in each of your Internet applications.
<P>
<li><B>Tooltips:</B> An item in the Options|General
Preferences|Appearance panel lets you turn on tooltips so that when
the mouse stays over a toolbar button, tooltip text appears.
<P>
<li><B>Unread mail and news messages:</B> Are now marked in bold.
<P>
<li><B>Helpers panel:</B> The Options|General Preferences|Helpers
panel has been redesigned to simplify editing, adding, and deleting
helper applications and plug-ins.
<P>
<li><B>User-interface improvements:</B> Several minor changes
regarding fonts, spacing, and tabs. Improved design in toolbar and
preferences panels.
<P>
<li><B>Enable active scrolling option:</B>The General|Appearance

<A NAME="LiveConnect">
<H3>LiveConnect</H3>
<ul>
<LI><B>Java, JavaScript, and Plug-in Connectivity:</B> Netscape's
LiveConnect lets you integrate Java, JavaScript and Navigator
plug-ins. This allows you to create plug-ins and applets that can be
controlled by Java and JavaScript, or use Java and JavaScript to
implement portions of your plug-in. Fundamentally, LiveConnect allows
you to call:
<ol>
<li>Java methods from plug-ins.
<li>Native methods implemented in plug-ins from Java.
<li>Java methods from JavaScript.
<li>JavaScript from Java methods. 
</ol>
<P>
You can find out more at <A
HREF=http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_3.0/developer/mojava.html>LiveConnect
Developer Information</A>. For further information about
Java-to-plug-in connections and Java-to-JavaScript connections
(including recent JRI/JAVAH changes), choose the <B>Help|Handbook</B>
menu item to find links to latest versions of the JavaScript Guide
and Plug-in Guide.
<P>
<LI><B>Disabling LiveConnect:</B> LiveConnect is disabled if either
Java or JavaScript is disabled in the Options|Network
Preferences|Languages panel.
</ul>


<A NAME="JavaScript">
<H3>JavaScript</H3>
<ul>
<LI><B>JavaScript-generated documents:</B> JavaScript-generated
documents can be printed, saved as files, and viewed with View
Document/Frame Source.
<P>
<LI><B>Resizing a window reloads its doc from cache:</B> Resizing a
window reloads its doc from cache and had formerly rerun script tags,
re-initialize global variables, and in general redo everything that
JavaScript did when the page first loaded (even the onload handler
was rerun). Now, no scripts are rerun, no onload is sent
(nor is onunload sent), and user-defined variables and properties
stay around. There is currently one exception: HTML objects (such as
forms, link) can lose their user-set properties. Such objects are
re-reflected by the reload caused by resizing.
<P>
<LI><B>NOSCRIPT tag:</B> A
<CODE>&lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;...&lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;</CODE> tag has been added
so that if a user has JavaScript turned off in the Network|Languages
preferences panel or if a user's browser application does not support
JavaScript, the user sees the HTML between the noscript tag and its
end tag.
<P>
<LI><B>SRC attribute:</B> The <CODE>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</CODE> tag now has
an additional attribute that allows a JavaScript file to be specified
as the JavaScript source (rather than embedding the JavaScript in the
HTML). Attributes within the SCRIPT tag can now be specified as
follows:
<P>
<CODE>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript SRC=mySource.js&gt; </CODE>
<P>
where mySource.js is the URL (relative or full address) of the
JavaScript source code file.
<P>
The LANGUAGE attribute is mandatory unless the SRC attribute is
present and specifies the scripting language. The SRC attribute is
optional and, if given, specifies a URL that loads the text of a
script. Both attributes may be present.
<P>
The SRC attribute specifies the scripting language by using the .js
suffix. The suffix must be mapped by the web server to the MIME type
"application/x-javascript" which the server sends back in the HTTP
GET reply's Content-type: header. Without a properly configured
server (one that maps .js filename suffix to application/x-javascript
MIME), Netscape won't respond properly with the data coming back in
the HTTP response to the SRC-initiated request.
<P>
<LI><B>Data tainting security model:</B> You can set NS_ENABLE_TAINT
to enable JavaScript in one window to see properties of a second
window, regardless of which server provided the second window's
document. When JavaScript in the first window attempts to send to a
server (other than the one that originated the data) data derived
from the second window's tainted properties, a confirming dialog is
brought up so that the user can cancel or confirm the transaction.
<P>
To set NS_ENABLE_TAINT:
<ul>
<li>On UNIX, use setenv.
<li>On Windows, use set.
<li>On Macintosh, edit the resource with type 'Envi' and number 128 in
the Netscape application by removing the two ascii slashes "//"
before the NS_ENABLE_TAINT text at the end of the resource.
</ul>
You can use two new functions, taint() and untaint(), to mark and
unmark an argument datum with taint associated with the current
script. For example, to remove taint from a form input element so
that it can be sent to another server by the server's script, you
would say:
<P>
<CODE>untainted = untaint(document.form1.input3)
<BR>// now untainted can be sent in a URL or form post by other scripts
</CODE>
<P>
Neither taint() nor untaint() modifies its single argument. Rather, both
functions return a marked or unmarked reference to the argument object,
or a copy of the primitive type value (number or boolean value).
<P>
<LI><B>JavaScript reflection of plug-ins:</B> Allows developers to
dynamically determine what plug-ins are installed on the client. By
making the list of installed plug-ins accessible through JavaScript,
content developers can write simple scripts to display embedded
plug-in data if the appropriate plug-in is installed, or display some
alternative information (image, text, etc.) if not.
<P>
JavaScript currently has a global "navigator" object which contains
properties for information not associated with any particular
document. This object now has two additional properties: a
"mimeTypes" object and a "plugins" object.
<P>
The mimeTypes object is an array of all MIME types supported by the
client (either internally, via helper apps, or by plug-ins). Each
element of the array is a mimeType object, which has properties for
its type, description, and file extensions.
<P>
The plugins object is an array of all plug-ins currently installed on
the client. Each element of the array is a plugin object, which has
properties for its name and description, as well as a subarray of
mimetype objects for the types supported by that plugin.
</ul>


<A NAME="Java">
<H3>Java</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>The APPLET tag now supports an ARCHIVE attribute:</B> This can improve
applet download time by reducing the number of HTTP connections required
to fetch applet code.  Example:

<XMP>
  <applet archive="Nuclear.zip"
    code="NuclearPlant.class"
    width=680 height=473>
  </applet>
</XMP>

This will cause the file Nuclear.zip to be downloaded to the user's
disk, and will search it for the NuclearPlant class and the classes it
requires. The zip file is found relative to the codebase path, and must
not be compressed.  Classes not in the zip file will still be searched
for via the old mechanism if required.
<P>
<li><B>Compatible with the JDK:</B> The Java implementation is now
compatible with the <A
HREF=http://www.javasoft.com/java.sun.com/products/JDK/index.html>Java
Developers Kit</A> (JDK version 1.0.2) from Sun.
<P>
<li><B>Mac Support:</B> Java support has been added to the Macintosh
Power PC and 68K platforms allowing users to run Java applets.
Applets are software programs written in the Java language that can
be integrated within HTML pages.
<P>
<li><B>UNIX Support:</B> Java support has been added to the IBM AIX
and BSDI platforms. The Java implementation is now compatible with
version 1.0.2 of the JDK from Sun.
<P >
<LI><B>Unicode Support: </B>Java applets will now display all Unicode
characters which can be rendered with an existing system font.
Support is no longer limited to the Latin-1 subset of Unicode:
Support is provided for Western (Latin 1) and Central European (Latin
2) languages, as well as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. This feature
is currently available on the UNIX and Macintosh platforms.
<P>
<li><B>Win 32 JIT Compiler:</B> On Windows 32 computers, a
just-in-time compiler translates Java bytecodes into Intel machine
code which makes many Java programs execute substantially faster.
<P>
<li><B>Windows AWT toolkit:</B> A completely new implementation of the
AWT toolkit fixes many bugs.
<P>
<li><B>JavaScript interaction using LiveConnect:</B> There is now a
new attribute for the APPLET tag called MAYSCRIPT which is required
for an applet that wishes to use LiveConnect and the
netscape.javascript classes to interact with JavaScript.

    <LI> When you use the right mouse to view a single GIF image (in 256 color
         mode), you might experience a "screen flash" when the custom colormap
         is installed.  The is also true for any page with one GIF image and no
         text.

    <LI> If you are running in 256 color mode and have a Windows
         background (wallpaper) image present, minimizing then
         restoring Netscape, might cause images and the Netscape logo
         to appear in strange colors. <B>Workarounds:</B> 1) Open
         a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish). 2) Remove
         the Windows background image.

	<LI>The Dialog class is not yet implemented.
	<LI>Java requires at least a 256 color video driver. 
	If you want to use the Navigator with less than
     	256 colors, Java must be disabled. 
	<LI>The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text 
	it can display. Once the window fills
     	up, it must be cleared before new text will appear. 
	<LI>In order for a Date object to display the time-zone (ie. PST) 
	the TZ environment variable must be
     	set (for both NT and Win95).

<LI><B>JavaScript Bugs:</B>
<UL>
<LI>Date objects convert in string context to numeric literals spelling the
milliseconds since 1970, instead of date strings such as "Thu Aug 01
14:57:54 PDT 1996".
<LI>Pages that call <tt>document.write</tt> to generate HTML must use HEIGHT and
WIDTH attributes on their IMG and EMBED tags, to avoid crashing when the
HTML layout delayed by the unsized images finishes.
<LI>Documents that are partly source HTML loaded from a server, and partly
generated by JavaScript, can be printed, saved, or viewed, but the
generated HTML will not appear on the printout, in the saved file, or in
the View window.
<LI>Calling <tt>document.open("text/plain")</tt> crashes the browser.
<LI>Nested tables mixed with script tags that call <tt>document.write()</tt>
can produce incorrectly formatted output, possibly including pieces of
the script tags.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>New <tt>document.write()</tt> behavior:</B>
A <tt>document.write()</tt> call from an event handler no
longer keeps JavaScript variables and objects functioning in a page. 
This could be a security problem. 
Instead, use a separate window, or do a large write, or use frames. 
<P>
<LI><B>LiveConnect Bugs:</b>
<UL>
<LI>Java "long" values can't be passed to or from javascript
<li>JavaScript calls to overloaded Java methods may not be resolved
correctly.
<li>There is no access to multidimensional Java arrays from JavaScript.
<LI>Network activity in Java code called from JavaScript will throw
an exception.
<LI>JavaScript can't call methods which have non-system classes as
arguments (i.e. applet-specific classes).  The workaround is to declare
those arguments as java.lang.Object (or some other ancestor system
class) and then cast them to the appropriate class inside the method.
<LI>If JavaScript code tries to access an applet before the applet has
finished loading, that applet will be inaccessible from JavaScript
even when the applet has finished loading.  The error message will
say something like "document.applets[0] has no properties."  You
can wait for all applets to finish loading by waiting for the onLoad
handler on the BODY tag to be called.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Putting percent signs (%) into URLs:</B>
Netscape now assumes URL encoding on <tt>mailto:</tt> URLs and
other types of URLs.
If you want to put a percent sign (%) into a URL, you need to
represent it as its hex code.  Substitute "<tt>%25</tt>" for the 
percent sign.  For example,
<blockquote>
<nobr><tt>&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:user%25uucp-host@somewhere.com&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/A&gt;</tt></nobr>
to send mail to: &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>user%uucp-host@somewhere.com</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI><B>Known bugs in International Support.</B>
<UL>
   <LI> If the Navigator is used on a machine using Japanese Windows 
        locale, the text on several buttons in the Options | General
        Preferences | Fonts dialog box will mis-display. The names 
        of the fonts may also mis-display. However, the font functionality
        is unaffected. They will display correctly when viewing
        documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document
        encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, 
        and the document you are viewing was encoded using that character set).
