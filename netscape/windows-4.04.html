<HR SIZE=3><A NAME="Known Issues"></A></DT>

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE=+2>K</FONT>NOWN<FONT SIZE=+2> I</FONT>SSUES</H3></CENTER>

<H3>General</H3>

<UL>
<LI>On some Windows 95 systems, installing Communicator causes the ODBC32 control panel to exit with an illegal operation. This may be related to an ODBC incompatibility with new system DLLs installed by Communicator. A workaround is to install a SmartUpdate package located at <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/smartupdate/msvc.jar">ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/communicator/smartupdate/msvc.jar</A>.</LI>
<LI>If you are using an applet that uses RMI callbacks, you must call netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalConnect") before the your first call into the RMI runtime.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="Known Navigator"></A>
<H3>Navigator</H3>

<UL>
<LI>If you are running Netscape Communicator on Windows NT 3.51 using a Matrox Millennium graphics driver, an application error may occur when viewing HTML pages. Obtain an updated version of the driver (version 2.25 or later).</LI>

<LI>After entering a URL that does not exist, avoid clicking the Stop button before Navigator notifies you that no DNS entry has been found. If you do click the Stop button, no more URLs will be found by Navigator. If this occurs, restart Communicator. A simple workaround is to wait until Navigator notifies you that it does not exist.</LI>

<LI>Transparency does not function correctly. If an image has a background chunk, it will be visible in transparent areas and the page background will not show through. To turn on background image printing,
choose Page Setup from the File menu and enable the Print Backgrounds option.</LI>

<LI>If a system halt related to the Kernel32.dll occurs, update the kernel. You can obtain the update from <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q148/3/36.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q148/3/36.asp</A>. This may correct the problem.</LI>

<LI>If you uninstalled beta versions of Communicator (Preview Release 5 or earlier) on Windows NT systems, you may experience trouble running <TT>.avi</TT>, <TT>.wav</TT>, <TT>.mid</TT>, or <TT>.rmi</TT> files.</LI>

<BR>To fix the problem:
<OL>
<LI>Open the Control Panel and select one of the following:</LI>
<UL>
<LI>For NT 3.51, select Drivers.</LI>
<LI>For NT 4.0, select Multimedia - Devices.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>Add the following drivers if they are not already listed: (MCI) CD Audio, (MCI) Microsoft Video for Windows,&nbsp; (MCI) Midi Sequencer, and (MCI) Sound.</LI>

<LI>Run <TT>regedt32.exe</TT> and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\MCI Extensions.</LI>

<LI>Select Add Value from the Edit menu; for Value Name enter <TT>avi</TT>, and for String enter <TT>avivideo</TT>.</LI>

<LI>Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>wav</TT>, and for String enter <TT>waveaudio</TT>.</LI>

<LI>Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>mid</TT>, and for String enter <TT>Sequencer</TT>.</LI>

<LI>Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>rmi</TT>, and for String enter <TT>Sequencer</TT>. You don't need to modify the data type.</LI>
</OL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>In a frame document, only the activated frame is printed, because only one frame can be printed at a time. To activate a frame, click on it.</LI>

<LI>Printing documents with applets, plugins, and webfonts on layer do not work properly.</LI>

<LI>The paddings property of Style Sheets is not supported. Use topPadding, rightPadding, bottomPadding, and leftPadding instead.</LI>

<LI>The margins property of Style Sheets is not supported. Use leftMargin, rightMargin, and bottomMargin instead.</LI>

<LI>Width, height, and border tags for images in Style Sheets are not enabled.</LI>

<LI>Under certain circumstances in a table cell, the EMBED tag parameter ALIGN=RIGHT causes the plugin not to be loaded or displayed. As a workaround, insert the ALIGN=RIGHT parameter in the table column and/or row descriptors.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Composer</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Starting Composer from the command line with <TT>netscape -edit</TT> (or double clicking on the Composer icon) does not start a new window if any other Communicator window is already active.</LI>

<LI>
Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 users: It is strongly recommended that you avoid
adding images larger than 1 MB to the Composer window. Doing so may cause
Communicator to halt.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<B>Messenger</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>If you encounter a general protection fault in <TT>msvcrt.dll</TT> when
sending a message, exit Communicator.&nbsp; This is caused by a <TT>.tmp</TT>
file Windows limitation. See your system administrator or equivalent about
removing these <TT>.tmp</TT> files from the Windows temp folder. Afterwards,
you can send messages from Communicator.</LI>

<LI>If a system halt occurs when invoking the Compose window, rename the address
book file (<TT>abook.nab</TT>) located in the Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;username>
directory.</LI>

<LI>A message saved as plain text (with a .txt extension) will be converted
into plain text instead of in original MIME format. If you save the message
to an existing file, the existing file will be replaced instead of having
the message appended to it.</LI>

<LI>If you get an error regarding expired certificates when sending/receiving
signed or encrypted mail, please go to <A HREF="http://www.verisign.com/update/faq/index.html">http://www.verisign.com/update/faq/index.html</A>
to update your certificate.</LI>

<LI>If you make changes to the Advanced S/MIME Cipher Preferences in the Messenger tab of the Security Advisor dialog box, you must communicate these changes to people that you exchange encrypted mail with.  To update their Certificate database information about you, send them a signed message. If you send only
encrypted messages, they will not be aware of  your preference changes.</LI>

<LI>The file format for certificate import and export has changed between Communicator
4.03 and 4.04 due to the standardization of PKCS 12. Communicator 4.04
imports certificates exported with older versions of Communicator. However,
older versions of Communicator will not be able to import files exported
with Communicator 4.04.</LI>

<LI>When downloading a user certificate, you will be able to save the certificate
for backup purposes. If the certificate chain does not yet exist on the
user's machine, the certificate will be exported without the certificate
chain. In this case, it is highly recommended that you save the certificate
after retrieving the certificate chain by going into the Security Advisor,
selecting Your Certificates and exporting the desired certificate.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Plug-ins</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
In 8-bit (256 color mode), you might experience color pallete problems
while loading some plug-ins in Communicator. If this happens, minimize
and then restore the window, or open a new Navigator window from the "File"
menu to fix this. Running Windows in 16-bit (high color) mode will completely
eliminate this problem.</LI>

<LI>
Sound files greater than 6MB are not supported in the 16 bit version and
may not play back properly.</LI>

<LI>
Plug-ins installed in previous version of Navigator are not automatically
transferred to Communicator. Re-install these plug-ins.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Netcaster</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
It is required that you use Communicator 4.03 or later with this version of Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>Java and JavaScript must be enabled to run Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
It is recommended that you select the Go Offline option from the File Menu
before viewing sites offline.</LI>

<LI>
The order of the channels in the selector may change after exiting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
The Automatically Load Images preference (Preferences, Advanced from the
Edit menu) should be checked.</LI>

<LI>
If you specify an invalid URL when adding a channel, the channel is added
under My Channels, but does not appear when you select it. A green light
may also appear; ignore this light.</LI>

<LI>
If you change a webtop to a channel in Channel Properties, the webtop remains
on your screen. Close the webtop and when you select it again in My Channels,
it appears as a channel in a Navigator window.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your Communicator preferences, such as color or font, while
Netcaster is open, a system halt may occur. Change your Communicator preferences
before starting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
The buttons in the Netcaster window may disappear depending on the font
you select.</LI>

<LI>
Select a channel before modifying any security information in the Options
dialog.</LI>

<LI>
Your channel settings may not be preserved if Communicator terminates abnormally.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your screen's resolution while Netcaster is running, the
Netcaster window may no longer be visible.</LI>

<LI>
The display and cache size of the Castanet channels cannot be modified.</LI>

<LI>
If you add a Castanet channel by specifying its IP address and then access the channel again by specifying its DNS name, Netcaster will attempt to resubscribe to the channel.</LI>

<LI>Unless you specifically use the Update Now command to update a channel, at most, two channels will update at the same time.</LI>

<LI>Some of the channel preferences may not be visible until you restart Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>If you add two channels with the same name, an error may occur.</LI>

<LI>You cannot move a webtop, as indicated in the Netcaster NetHelp.</LI>
