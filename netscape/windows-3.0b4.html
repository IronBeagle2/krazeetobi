<H3>General Features</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>New Directory buttons:</b> The directory button toolbar now
includes Destinations and People. Net Directory and Handbook have
been removed.
<P>
<li><b>New Directory menu items:</b> The Directory menu now has items
for Netscape Destinations and People. Internet Directory and Internet
White Pages have been removed.
<P>
<li><b>New Navigation for Frames and the <b>Back</b> button:</b> Now,
when you click on a link that updates a frame, pressing the
<b>Back</b> button returns you to the previous state of the frame.
Previously, pressing the <b>Back</b> button ignored updates within a
page's frames and always returned you to the previous whole
page (further back than you probably wanted). In short, navigating
among frames now works on a per frame basis: pressing <b>Back</b>
revisits the previous frame and pressing <b>Forward</b> revisits the
frame ahead.
<P>
<li><b>Three-pane configurability:</b> A pane layout option has been
added to the <b>Mail and News|Appearance</b> panel (choose the
<b>Options|Mail and News Preferences|Appearance</b> menu item). The
panel offers radio buttons to designate the layout of the three panes
in the Mail and News windows. Choose <b>Split Horizontal</b>
(<b>Articles on top</b> on Macintosh) to align the message content
pane to the right of the two split panes. Choose <b>Split
Vertical</b> (<b>Articles on left</b> on Macintosh) to align the
message content pane below the two split panes. Choose <b>Stack</b>
(<b>Stacked</b> on Macintosh) to align the message content pane below
the two stacked panes (layered in rows atop one another).
<P>
<li><b>Show recipient in Sent Folder and Outbox:</b> When you select
a mail folder by clicking on it, the message heading pane displays
the titles of messages contained in that folder. In previous
versions, you'd always see the title <b>Sender</b> above a column
that shows the name of the sender of the mail message. Now, in the
Outbox and Sent Mail folders, you'll see the title <b>Recipient</b>
instead of </b>Sender</b>, and the column shows the email address of
the mail recipient. For sent mail, the recipient info is much more
useful than the sender info (typically yourself).
<P>
<li><b>Compressed headers:</b> When viewing either the Mail or
News window, the <b>Options</b> menu now offers a cascading
(hierarchical) menu items called <b>Show Headers</b> that replaces
the <b>Show All Headers</b> item. The new menu item gives you more
options to control the number of header information fields displayed
when viewing messages. <b>All</b> displays all possible header
fields. <b>Normal</b> displays the primary address fields.
<b>Brief</b> displays only subject and recipient fields.
<P>
<li><b>Support table cell background colors:</b> You can specify a
background color to be used when displaying table cells. To specify a
table background color use the <b>bgcolor</b> attribute. Nested
tables inherit background colors.
<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 WIDTH=20%>
 <CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells</CAPTION>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffdddd>One Color</TD></TR>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ccffff>Another Color</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<p>
The <b>bgcolor</b> tag specifies one of the supported color names and
can be used with the following tags: <b>table</b>, <b>td</b>,
<b>th</b>, and <b>tr</b>.
<P>
Here's the HTML that produced the table on
the right.
<br clear=all>

 <CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells</CAPTION>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ffdddd>One Color</TD></TR>
 <TR><TD BGCOLOR=#ccffff>Another Color</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</XMP>
<P>
<li><b>Netscape Navigator Gold:</b> Netscape Navigator Gold has been
updated for Win32 and Mac. Gold now lets you edit tables.
<P>
<li><b>New Network preferences panels:</b> New Network|Protocols and
Network|Languages preference panels to expand and improve user
preferences for security and privacy control.

</UL>
</ul>

<H3>Java</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Mac Support:</B> Java support has been added to the Macintosh
Power PC and 68K platforms allowing users to run Java applets.
Applets are software programs written in the Java language that can
be integrated within HTML pages.
<P>
<li><B>UNIX Support:</B> Java support has been added to the IBM AIX 
and BSDI platforms.
<P>
<li><B>Security:</B> A security problem relating to DNS has been fixed.
</ul>

<H3>JavaScript</H3>
<ul>
<LI><B>JavaScript reflection of plug-ins:</B> Allows developers to
dynamically determine what plug-ins are installed on the client. By
making the list of installed plug-ins accessible through JavaScript,
content developers can write simple scripts to display embedded
plug-in data if the appropriate plug-in is installed, or display some
alternative information (image, text, etc.) if not.
<P>
JavaScript currently has a global "navigator" object which contains
properties for information not associated with any particular
document. This object now has two additional properties: a
"mimeTypes" object and a "plugins" object.
<P>
The mimeTypes object is an array of all MIME types supported by the
client (either internally, via helper apps, or by plug-ins). Each
element of the array is a mimeType object, which has properties for
its type, description, and file extensions.
<P>
The plugins object is an array of all plug-ins currently installed on
the client. Each element of the array is a plugin object, which has
properties for its name and description, as well as a subarray of
mimetype objects for the types supported by that plugin.
<P>
<LI><B>JavaScript fixes:</B> Incremental improvements.
</ul>

<H3>LiveConnect</H3> (Java, JavaScript, and Plug-in Connectivity)
<ul>
<LI>Netscape's LiveConnect lets you integrate Java, JavaScript and
Navigator plug-ins. This allows you to create plug-ins and applets that
can be controlled by Java and JavaScript, or use Java and JavaScript to
implement portions of your plug-in. Fundamentally, LiveConnect allows you
to call: 
<ol>
<li>Java methods from plug-ins.
<li>Native methods implemented in plug-ins from Java.
<li>Java methods from JavaScript.
<li>JavaScript from Java methods. 
</ol>
<P>
You can find further information about Java-to-plug-in connections and
Java-to-JavaScript connections by choosing Netscape's Help|Handbook
menu item. Near the top of the Handbook contents page are links to
latest versions of the JavaScript Guide and Plug-in Guide.
</ul>

<H3>Security</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>New section in Security preferences panel:</b> New Secure
Network Protocol section in Security|General Preferences to control
access to SSL v2 and SSL v3.
<P>
<LI><b>Note:</b> The security features described below are not yet fully
implemented and do not offer any current functionality. Though
elements of the user interface can be viewed in the preference
panels, they should not be used. Certain buttons might cause crashes.
<P>
<li><b>Security Preferences: </b> Two new security preference panels
have been added to enable forthcoming security features. A short
summary of the forthcoming features are described below. 
<P>
<li><b>Personal Certificate panel:</b> Personal certificates identify
you to others on the Internet. For example, when you submit
information in a form, your personal certificate allows the recipient
of the form to know the information came from you and no one else.
<P>
You may wish to obtain more than one personal certificate. Some web
sites may request (and issue to you) a personal certificate for
specific use with their site. You may also obtain more generic
personal certificates that represent you for credit card transactions
or other nonspecific, secure communications.
<P>
<li><b>Passwords panel:</b> A Netscape password protects you if your
computer can be physically accessed by other people or remotely
accessed through a network. Your password protects your security
certificates.
</ul>

<H3>Expanded support</H3>
<ul>
<li><b>POP3 servers:</b> The <b>Keep Mail on Server</b> and <b>Maximum
Message Size</b> options now work even with POP3 servers that do not
implement the UIDL command.
<P>
<li><b>Special characters:</b> Additional entity names such as "&pound"
are now implemented.
</ul>

<H3>Macintosh-only Changes</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Open Transport native:</B> Native support for Apple Open Transport.
<P>
<li><B>Internet Config:</B>  Basic Internet Config features are
supported. Internet Config is a public domain system extension that
lets you configure Internet information such as email address and
server names in a single source location. This is useful if you are
using multiple Internet applications. Supporting applications can
find this information, making it unnecessary for you to enter the
same information in each of your Internet applications.
<P>
<li><B>Tooltips:</B> An item in the Options|General
Preferences|Appearance panel lets you turn on tooltips so that when
the mouse stays over a toolbar button, tooltip text appears.
<P>
<li><B>Unread mail and news messages:</B> Are now marked in bold.
<P>
<li><B>Helpers panel:</B> The Options|General Preferences|Helpers
panel has been redesigned to simplify editing, adding, and deleting
helper applications and plug-ins.
<P>
<li><B>User-interface improvements:</B> Several minor changes
regarding fonts, spacing, and tabs. Improved design in toolbar and
preferences panels.
<P>
<li><B>Enable active scrolling option:</B>The General|Appearance
preference panel has a check box to allow active window scrolling.
When checked, movement of the scroll bar thumb causes the content
area to scroll as you drag. When unchecked, movement of the scroll
bar thumb causes the content area to scroll only after the mouse
button is released. The default is checked. On slower computers,
scrolling performance might improve when the setting is unchecked.
</ul>

<H3>Windows-only Changes</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Forms Printing:</B> The printing of forms has been improved.
<P>
<li><B>Image Presentation:</B>Image outlines and alt text are
presented before image loading.
</ul>

<H3>UNIX-only Changes</H3>
<ul>
<li><B>Plug-in support on UNIX platforms:</B> SGI IRIX, SunOS, Solaris
2.3, Solaris 2.4, DEC OSF/1, HP/UX.
<P>
<li><B>Frame Source and Frame Info:</B> The View menu has items for
Frame Source and Frame Info, available when a frame is selected.
<P>
<li><B>Quoted text color:</B> The Mail and News Preferences|Appearance
panel has a field that lets you enter the color of your quoted text.
<P>
<li><B>Hide menu bar:</B> The Options menu has an item to let you hide
the menu bar. Use the right mouse button to display the pop-up menu
containing an item to show the menu bar again.
<P>
<li><B>Drag-and-drop attachments:</B> To create an attachment, you can
drag a mail message item from the message pane to the attachment
field of the Composition window.
<P>
<li><B>Drag-and-drop news:</B> You can drag News window articles to
store them in Mail window folders.
<P>
<li><B>HP/UX:</B> The HP/UX platform now has dynamic linking.
<P>
<li><B>Helpers panel:</B> The Options|General Preferences|Helpers
panel has been redesigned to simplify editing, adding, and deleting
helper applications and plug-ins.

<LI><B>CoolTalk:</B>
<UL>
<LI>If you had previously installed the CoolTalk Watchdog, you need
  to uninstall it by un-installing Netscape Navigator, and then
  reboot your machine before installing the latest version of the
  Navigator.  In WindowsNT and Windows3.x, you can also do that by
  removing the Cooltalk Watchdog Icon from the Startup Program Group, and then
  restart Windows before installing Netscape Navigator 3.0b4.
<P>  
<LI>In Windows95, you can right mouse click on the Cooltalk
  Watchdog Icon and exit before installing Netscape Navigator
  3.0b4. You will find the Cooltalk Watchdog Icon (if turned on)
  in the right corner of the Win95 Task Bar. 

<LI>During installation of CoolTalk, the command line argument for
the Watchdog is incorrect.  It should read as follows:
<blockquote>
<tt>wdog.exe /v </tt><i>"path to CoolTalk executable"</i><tt>\cooltalk.exe</tt>

         cannot decode x-gzip files when the VRML worlds are 
         loaded with Live3D. You should ignore this error dialog and
         click OK.
	<P>

<UL>
<LI>If you
       have old data in your disk cache, you may still see the problem where
       Netscape Navigator is not showing you the most recent version of the 
       web pages because of daylight savings time conflicts. To remedy this 
       problem, clear your disk cache the first time you run the Navigator.

 <P>   If you have cleared your disk cache, and are still seeing this problem,
       go to Help Menu|How to Give Feedback and tell us about the problem.
</UL>

<P><LI><B>Navigator Problems:</B>
<UL>
     
    <LI> After setting any  preferences in Mail (or News) , you need 
           to quit the Mail (or News) application and run it again         
         for the value to take effect.

    <LI> Pressing Spacebar will unsubscribe a newsgroup from the List, in
         the News Window.
     
    <LI> When you use the right mouse to view a single GIF image (in 256 color
         mode), you might experience a "screen flash" when the custom colormap
         is installed.

    <LI> If you are running in 256 color mode and have a Windows
         background (wallpaper) image present, minimizing then
         restoring Netscape, might cause images and the Netscape logo
         to appear in strange colors. <B>Workarounds:</B> 1) Open
         a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish). 2) Remove
         the Windows background image.

    <LI> When Un-installing Netscape, you might get a File Error Dialog
         that says "Cannot find CTL3D.DLL"; click on the Close button
         and the Un-installation will continue.

    <LI> If Netscape is crashing in the video driver, ensure that you
         are using the latest drivers for your Video card.
         You can obtain the latest drivers on-line or by contacting
         your Video Card's manufacturer.

    <LI> The Up/Down direction box in the Find dialog in Mail & News 
         are not implemented yet.

    <LI> You will not receive a warning dialog when sending a 
         message when your disk is out of space. An empty message will
         be sent to the recipient(s).

    <LI> The 32bit install does not currently remove obsolete DLLs if you
         install Atlas Preview Release 2 on top of previous version of the
         Navigator.

         a Mail Attachment.

    <LI> Cannot open the Navigator easily , if in the previous session one
         enters non lower case letters in the Nickname column of Address Book
          | Item |Add User or Add List. You will get the error message few
         times. Just keep clicking the OK button until the Navigator opens.
 
    <LI> Images aren't transparent in table cells with a background color.

    <LI> Referer field is not sent in frame documents.

    <LI> <I>Deleting Certificates:</I> When deleting certificates or CA's, it
         is a good idea to exit and restart the Navigator to make certain
         that the change took effect.

    <LI><I>Socket is already connected:</I> If you can't connect to secure
       <I>(https://)</I> sites because of a network error message saying the

        <LI>An IMG tag without HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes may cause 
            JavaScript event handlers on subsequent form elements to be ignored. 
         <I>Workarounds:</I>Add HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to all IMG tags, 
            or add one empty SCRIPT tag after the last form
            element that has a JavaScript event handler. 


        <LI> The lastIndexOf method should search a string backwards starting
          at the fromIndex position. In this release, it starts one character
          before the fromIndex position.

        <LI> You should be able to set the form object's method 
          property at any time. It is read-only in this release.

        <LI> The documentation for the name property states 
          "If multiple objects on the same form have the same NAME attribute, 
          an array of the given name is created automatically... 
          Elements are indexed in source order starting at 0." 
          In Atlas Preview Release 2, elements are indexed in source order if the object
          contains an event handler. If the object does not contain an event
          handler, they are indexed in reverse order.

        <LI> Radio buttons in the same radio object should be indexed 
          in source order starting at 0. In Atlas Preview Release 2, 
          they are indexed in reverse order.

        <LI> The window.status property always evaluates to the string
          value of window.defaultStatus.

        <LI> If you do not specify a set of windowFeatures when you call 
          window.open in a UNIX environment, the window is created 
          without any of the Boolean features.

        <LI> Calling document.close() from top-level code within 
          a script tag may crash Navigator.  It is safe
          to close documents that you open; only close on the 
          currently-loading document is unsafe.

        <LI>The Math properties E,LOG2E,LOG10E,LN2,PI,SQRT2,SQRT1_2 are
            erroneously defined as global properties, not as properties
            of the Math object. So rather than Math.E, you need to use 
            just E. Workaround that is compatible with future and past
            releases: with (Math) {...E;}.  
 
         <LI>Objects held by properties are not always freed because of a
             reference counting bug.

         <LI>The scrollbar is sometimes missing from pages with Javascript.
             Just hit the spacebar to make the scrollbar appear.
        
     <LI><I>New <tt>document.write()</tt> behavior:</I> A <tt>document.write()
     </tt> call from an event handler no longer keeps JavaScript variables
     and objects functioning in a page. This could be a security problem.
     Instead ,use a separate window, or do a large write or use frames.   
 
          <LI> Heavy use of JavaScript applets will cause memory leaks on your system, 
especially on Windows 3.1

</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Java problems with the 32bit Navigator:</B>
<UL>
   <LI> Java will not run using the 32bit Trumpet Winsock.  If you want to use
        Trumpet Winsock with the Navigator, Java must be disabled.
   <LI> Java requires at least a 256 color video driver.  If you want to use the
        Navigator with less than 256 colors, Java must be disabled.
   <LI> The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text it can display.
        Once the window fills up, it must be cleared before new text will appear.
   <LI> java.lang.Math.IEEERemainder(...) returns incorrect results.
   <LI> In order for a Date object to display the time-zone (ie. PST) the TZ
        environment variable must be set (for both NT and Win95).
   <LI> The AWT File Dialog box is not implemented.  An exception is thrown if
        you try to create a java.awt.FileDialog object.   
   <LI> The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes.
   <LI><I>Can't start Java Applets:</I> Make sure Java is turned on. Check
       Options | Network Preferences..| Languages.
   <LI> Heavy use of Java applets will cause memory leaks.
</UL>
<P>

<LI><B>LiveConnect Bugs:</b>
<UL>
<LI>Java "long" values can't be passed to or from javascript
<li>Network activity in Java code called from JavaScript may hang
the Navigator.  The most common cause of this is opening a java.net.URL
or referring to a Java class that must be loaded from the network.  The
workaround is to do these operations from a Java thread, or to make sure
that the class is loaded by calling a static method on it in the applet's
init routine.
<li>JavaScript calls to overloaded Java methods may not be resolved
correctly.
<li>There is no access to multidimensional Java arrays from JavaScript.
<li>It is necessary to have the MAYSCRIPT attribute in the applet tag
if the applet has to call JavaScript: if this isn't present the
JSObject.getWindow() routine will return null.
<li>There is a bug in beta 4 that may allow applets to call JavaScript without
the MAYSCRIPT attribute.
<li>LiveConnect is disabled if either Java or JavaScript are disabled in
Options | Network Preferences | Languages.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Putting percent signs (%) into URLs:</B>
Netscape now assumes URL encoding on <tt>mailto:</tt> URLs and
other types of URLs.
If you want to put a percent sign (%) into a URL, you need to
represent it as its hex code.  Substitute "<tt>%25</tt>" for the 
percent sign.  For example,
<blockquote>
<nobr><tt>&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:user%25uucp-host@somewhere.com&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/A&gt;</tt></nobr>
to send mail to: &nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>user%uucp-host@somewhere.com</tt>
</blockquote>
<P>
<LI><B>Known bugs in International Support.</B>
<UL>
   <LI> If the Navigator is used on a machine using Japanese Windows 
        locale, the text on several buttons in the Options | General
        Preferences | Fonts dialog box will mis-display. The names 
        of the fonts may also mis-display. However, the font functionality
        is unaffected. They will display correctly when viewing
        documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document
        encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, 
        and the document you are viewing was encoded using that character set).
   <LI> Entering multi-byte characters in forms is not implemented in this release.
