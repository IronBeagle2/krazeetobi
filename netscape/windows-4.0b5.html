<LI>
Plug-ins from other companies installed in previous versions of Navigator
are not automatically transferred to Communicator. Re-install these plug-ins.</LI>

<LI>
You might experience color palette problems with plug-ins and Communicator.
Minimize and restore the Communicator window. Also, running in 16-bit high-color
mode solves the problem.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
SmartUpdate</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
If a SmartUpdate download of an item occurs while that item is open or

<H3>
Java</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
JSObject.getWindow requires an applet as an argument.</LI>

<LI>
toLocaleString()method in Date Class throws security exceptions.</LI>

<LI>
Classes loaded from CLASSPATH are no longer privileged.</LI>

<LI>
FileInputStream object's available method fails.</LI>

<LI>
JDK 1.1 packages missing in this beta include java.math and sun.rmi.</LI>

<LI>
The java.security package is unsupported.</LI>

<LI>
Although the targets UniversalFileRead and UniversalFileWrite are fully
implemented for the signed classes and the netscape.security. Target objects,
the parameter targets FileRead and FileWrite, used for individual file
access grants, are not supported.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
JavaScript</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
New Behavior in Communicator:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Multi-byte character-set encodings (such as Shift-JIS) can be passed through
JavaScript either as string literals or with LiveConnect to and from Java.
Manipulation within JavaScript is dangerous since built-in methods do not
recognize multi-byte encodings.</LI>

<LI>
In a frame, history.back, history.forward, and history.go(n) manipulate
the frame's local history, not the history of the entire Navigator window
that the Back button manipulates.</LI>

<LI>
In addition to loading system classes, JavaScript can now load Java classes
located at the same URL as the page.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
LiveConnect</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
When JavaScript code called from Java encounters an error, the error may
be reported&nbsp; to Java in future calls to JavaScript.</LI>

<LI>
Calls from JavaScript to plug-ins and back to JavaScript can sometimes
deadlock.</LI>

<LI>
The ARCHIVE attribute of a script tag does not propagate to the Java class
loader.</LI>

<LI>
JavaScript and Java don't share class loaders, so passing Java objects
as arguments from JavaScript to Java may fail.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Regular expressions</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
When invoked with the case-insensitive option, String.replace() incorrectly
changes the return string to lower case.</LI>

<LI>
When RegExp.exec() is invoked more than once, the index property of the
resulting array is incorrect.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
In nested frames the unload event is sent without alerts or confirmation
dialogs.</LI>

<LI>
Plain text written using document.write() sometimes changes to HTML text&nbsp;
when reloading or resizing.</LI>

<LI>
Using window.alert inside onBlur handlers can cause infinite loops.</LI>

<LI>
When focus is given from a form field to the top level window then back
to the form element, the form's onFocus handler does not always get called.</LI>

<LI>
The image onAbort event handler does not work correctly in frames.</LI>

<LI>
document.write does not work inside JavaScript entities followed by {....}.</LI>

<LI>
The output of dates incorrectly returns the date in milliseconds when the
date is concatenated with a string.</LI>

<LI>
Signed scripts do not work.</LI>

<LI>
The onMouseOut and onMouseOver handlers do not work.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Layering and absolute positioning</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Layer stacking order is not preserved across window/frame resize.</LI>

<LI>
Negative values for the Z-INDEX attribute on LAYER and ILAYER tags are
not recognized.</LI>

<LI>
Clicking on a link in a SRC layer, where the link has no TARGET attribute,
causes the target page to be loaded into the top-level window,&nbsp; instead
of replacing the layer.&nbsp; It is not possible to target URLs at layers
as with frames. The back/forward buttons do not work with layers.</LI>

<LI>
It is not possible to use #URLs (named anchors) as the value for a LAYER's
SRC attribute.&nbsp; Also, links to named anchors from a link within a
layer may not work properly.</LI>

<LI>
The new width and height properties added to the document object may conflict
with user-defined variables of the same name. It is recommended that scripts
containing these properties be modified to use differently-named variables
or use the var keyword to declare such variables before they are used to
eliminate the conflict.</LI>

<LI>
Changing the contents of a layer (calling the load method, setting the
src property, calling document.open/write/close) has certain restrictions:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
They cannot be done while the main document is still loading.</LI>

<LI>
Only one layer can be changed at a given time. Changes to multiple layers
must be done serially. You can use the onLoad event handler for layers
to achieve the required serialization.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
The Find in Page command does not work in layers.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Style Sheets</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The use of negative margins to overlap text can cause very unpredictable
results and is not recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Use CSS positioning or layers to overlap text.</LI>

<LI>
Negative margin values are only allowed for margin-top and margin-bottom.</LI>

<LI>
Do not use pixel units. Because of variances of fonts among operating systems
(PC, MAC and UNIX) most fonts will not have the exact same pixel dimensions.&nbsp;
The use of relative units, epecially EMs which are based on the current
size of the font, regardless of which font actually gets selected, is highly
recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Assigning styles to the &lt;LI> tag only effect the bullet not the text
as it should.&nbsp; To work around the problem enclose the text with a
&lt;SPAN> tag or assign the style to the &lt;UL> or &lt;OL> tag.</LI>

<LI>
Sizing images using style sheets is disabled.</LI>

<LI>
Following their original web design, tables do not inherit styles from
the surrounding text or style sheet.</LI>

<LI>
You cannot assign most styles to the &lt;TABLE> or &lt;TR> elements. Use
the &lt;TD> element instead.&nbsp; Exceptions are: background image and
color on the &lt;TABLE> tag which work as expected. For other styles, results
may vary depending on the complexity of the table and their use is not
recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Small-caps and obliqe font styles are not supported</LI>

<LI>
Postioning of empty tag elements (eg images) is not supported</LI>

<LI>
Dotted and dashed border styles are not supported.</LI>

<LI>
Border colors and styles can only be applied to all four sides at once
via the border-color and border-style properties. They cannot be set on
a per side basis.</LI>

<LI>
The vertical-align property only applies to replaced elements and does
not support percentage units, sub, or super.</LI>

<LI>
The background property inherits into text elements.&nbsp; Apply a "background-color
: transparent" if you do no want inheritance.</LI>

<LI>
Unsupported CSS attributes include:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
word-spacing and letter-spacing</LI>

<LI>
first-line and first-letter styles</LI>

<LI>
list-style-image and list-style-position</LI>

<LI>
white-space: no-wrap</LI>

<LI>
font-variant&nbsp; (see small-caps above)</LI>

<LI>
!important</LI>

<LI>
background-attachment and background-position</LI>
</UL>
In order to make pixel units print sensibly when going to high resolution
printers, pixel units are scaled to a virtual display resolution of&nbsp;
120dpi.&nbsp; What this means is that when going to a 300dpi printer, fonts
that are specified as being 12px high will be output as 30px or 7.2pts
which is how they would appear on a screen with a 120dpi resolution.&nbsp;
This is consistant with how pixel units specified via HTML tags (for example
&lt;table width=100>) are scaled.&nbsp; This scaling will not cause fonts
to have jagged edges since the font will be printed at the full 300dpi
resolution at 7.2pts.&nbsp; All other related pixel units (line-height,
margins, etc.) are scaled as well.</UL>

<H3>
SmartUpdate</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
For developer-related issues regarding SmartUpdate and JAR files, see the
release notes for the JAR Packager, which are at: <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/relnotes.html">http://developer.netscape.com/software/signedobj/relnotes.html</A></LI>

Known Issues</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
UTF-8 pages displayed under US Windows 95 may not work properly when the
Windows 95 system was installed using the Custom Install option. Re-install
Windows 95 using the Typical install option to eliminate the problem.</LI>

<LI>
Copying and pasting CJK characters in a UTF-8 form has a limitation and
may not work well if the copy source itself is in UTF-8.</LI>

<LI>
If there is a mismatch between the HTTP server character set and the document's
own Meta Charset, the document's Charset Tag may predominate.</LI>

<LI>
On Windows NT, Cyrillic/Greek/Turkish/Central European characters may not
display correctly in TextArea and Text Input for an HTML FORM.</LI>

<LI>
Using the View Page Info command may cause the original page to display
incorrectly when the Page Info window is closed. Reload the page to restore
the correct display.</LI>

<LI>
When multiple frames are created by JavaScript, the second or later pages
may be assigned the incorrect character set. For example, a search result
page may be generated this way. In such a case, resize the window or reload
the frame to restore the correct display. Page designers can avoid this
problem by initially loading multiple frames using conventional HTML rather
than with JavaScript.</LI>

<LI>
Communicator supports only one encoding for multiple layers.</LI>

<LI>
HTML Composer cannot save documents in ISO-2022-JP (Japanese) or ISO-2022-KR
(Korean).</LI>

<LI>
Under Chinese/Japanese/Korean encodings, if there are more than one ASCII
spaces in HTML mail and documents, all but the last one will be converted
to a full-width space in that particular encoding.&nbsp; When you view
such a mail message or documents under the Western encoding, it will be
displayed as unintelligible strings in ASCII.&nbsp; A typical case of this
would be reply/quoting an English mail message under a Japanese encoding.
For composing HTML mail and documents which contain only ASCII (for example,
English only), use one of the following methods:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Use the Western encoding to compose such mail or documents</LI>

<LI>
If an Asian encoding is used, insert only one space between sentences and
avoid using tabs.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
An Address Book/Mail Header name resolution may insert an equivalent of
ASCII&nbsp; backslash "\" in the display of certain Japanese and Chinese
characters. This is a cosmetic problem likely to occur only with Shift_JIS
(Japanese) and Big5 (Taiwan) encodings. Email address resolution should
work all right and messages can be sent.</LI>

<LI>
There may be a slight imperfection in the Address Book resolution when
there are multi-byte (C/J/K) language entries.</LI>
