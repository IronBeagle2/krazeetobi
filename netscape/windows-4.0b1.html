<UL>
<H3>General and Setup</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Help information is available on some, but not all, tasks and topics.
Minimum Install includes Help on some functions that aren't provided with
the minimum installation. Resizing, maximizing, or restoring the Help window
causes the contents to forward a page.</LI>

<LI>Plug-ins from other companies installed in previous versions of Navigator
aren't automatically transferred over to Communicator. You need to re-install
these plug-ins.</LI>

<LI>During installation, Communicator copies the address book from Navigator
3.0 to your user directory, but in order to update the address book format
you need to import the address book file. To import address books, choose
Import from the File menu in the Address Book window. The address book
is the file <B>address.htm</B> in the user directory (the default is<B>
\Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;user name&gt;</B>)</LI>

<LI>After installing this release for the first time on a system that has
a previous version of Navigator installed, the cookie file (<B>cookie.txt</B>)
and the history file (<B>netscape.hst</B>) may not be copied to the first
user profile. To use the information stored in these files, copy them from
the previous Navigator directory (the default is <B>\Program Files\Netscape\Navigator</B>)
to the user directory (the default is <B>\Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;user
name&gt;</B>).</LI>

<LI>There are several printing problems, including incorrect printing of
images and improper alignment on the page.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Navigator</H3>

<UL>
<LI>On 256-color video displays, after browsing several pages the colors
in your page might look distorted. You can usually restore the correct
colors by minimizing and then restoring the window.</LI>

<LI>Reloading a page containing forms might cause form elements to disappear.</LI>

<LI>Resizing a window containing a QuickTime movie causes the browser to
shift the location of the QuickTime movie.</LI>

<LI>When reloading pages containing a frameset, certain frames may display
incorrectly or may not display at all. </LI>
<LI>Inflow layers, created using the &lt;ILAYER&gt;&nbsp;tag, are not implemented.</LI>

<LI>For the VISIBILITY&nbsp;attribute of the &lt;LAYER&gt;&nbsp;and &lt;ILAYER&gt;&nbsp;tags,
the only accepted values are HIDE and INHERIT. A value of SHOW&nbsp;is
ignored and the layer's visibility defaults to INHERIT.</LI>

<LI>Percentage values are not accepted for the TOP, LEFT, CLIP&nbsp;and
WIDTH attributes of the &lt;LAYER&gt; and &lt;ILAYER&gt;&nbsp;tags.</LI>

<LI>Using in-line JavaScript (i.e. JavaScript entities) to specify the
values of attributes for any&nbsp;tag does not work. As a workaround, layers
can be initially hidden, and subsequently positioned and shown using the
<TT>left</TT>, <TT>top </TT>and <TT>visibility </TT>properties of the corresponding
JavaScript layer object, within a &lt;SCRIPT&gt; tag.</LI>

<LI>The following JavaScript layer object properties are not implemented:&nbsp;<TT>width</TT>,
<TT>height</TT>, <TT>zIndex</TT>, <TT>background</TT>, <TT>bgColor</TT>,
<TT>above </TT>and <TT>below</TT>. To change the z-order of a layer dynamically,
use the <TT>moveAbove </TT>and <TT>moveBelow </TT>methods.</LI>

<LI>For the <TT>visibility </TT>property of JavaScript layer objects, the
only accepted values are &quot;hide&quot; and &quot;inherit&quot;.</LI>

<LI>Embedded plug-ins (created using the &lt;EMBED&gt; or &lt;OBJECT&gt;&nbsp;tag)
and Java applets (created using the &lt;APPLET&gt; or &lt;OBJECT&gt; tag)
within a &lt;LAYER&gt;&nbsp;tag may not be positioned correctly. They will
not be hidden when the containing layer is hidden.</LI>

<LI>Form elements in layers may not display correctly if the enclosing
layer is moved or clipped by a parent layer.</LI>

<LI>Resizing a page containing &lt;LAYER&gt; tags and JavaScript may result
in a crash.</LI>

<LI>&lt;BLINK&gt; tags do not display correctly if they are placed within
a &lt;LAYER&gt;&nbsp;tag.</LI>

<LI>Client-side image maps do not receive <TT>onMouseOver </TT>and <TT>onMouseOut
</TT>events correctly when they are placed within a &lt;LAYER&gt;&nbsp;tag,
unless the layer is positioned with TOP and LEFT&nbsp;values of 0.</LI>

<LI>In the absence of an explicit CLIP&nbsp;value, the clipping rectangle
of a layer should be sized to include the contents of the &lt;LAYER&gt;&nbsp;tag,
as well as all its child layers. Currently, the clipping rectangle is only
sized to include the contents of the &lt;LAYER&gt; tag.</LI>

<LI>Acceptable values for the Z-INDEX&nbsp;attribute and corresponding
<TT>zIndex </TT>JavaScript property should be all integers, where negative
integers indicate that the layer should exist below its parent in z-order.
Currently, only positive values are accepted and all child layers are forced
to exist above their parent in z-order.</LI></UL>

<H3>Java and JavaScript</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Some Java applets may not show; a gray box may appear instead. </LI>

<LI>Various Java applets display have color palette problems. These applets
display with wrong colors. The problems are more common on 256-color video.
</LI>

<LI>Resizing may cause applets to load improperly. </LI>

<LI>Jzip files generated by applets are not removed from the temp directory
</LI>

<LI>Images in JavaScript do not appear when generated by XBM</LI>

<LI>The main Java thread halts when a join is used. You need to restart
Communicator in order for Java to work again.</LI>

<LI>Running JavaScript for a prolonged period of time may result in lost
resources. </LI>

<LI>When the JavaScript onClick handler changes the anchor or the target
of the link, a wrong page appears</LI>

<LI>Entities in image size specifiers don't yet work properly </LI>

<LI>Javascript-generated HTML&nbsp;is slower in this release than it was
in previous versions of Navigator.</LI>

<LI>Select method only works if the focus method is used on the form before
the select method </LI>

<LI>onClickhandler changing the anchor or target of a link doesn't work</LI>

<LI>Resizing a&nbsp;JavaScript-generated HTML&nbsp;page causes a wysiwyg
to appear in the location bar.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Composer</H3>

<UL>
<LI>You cannot change the Font face property through the Character Properties
dialog box. Instead, use the Font Face popup menu in the Composer Toolbar.
</LI>

<LI>Hiding Tables in Mail Composer or Netscape Composer may cause your
system to halt. </LI>

<LI>Changing the height or width values in the Insert Image dialog box
may cause your system to halt.</LI>

<LI>Undo does not yet work</LI>

<LI>Images from your local drive that you insert in mail in the HTML Mail
Composer don't currently display when you send the message. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Messenger and Collabra </H3>

<UL>
<LI>When composing a message and attaching a file, you cannot delete the
attachment. It may appear that the attachment is deleted, but when the
message is sent, the attachment is still there. The workaround if you want
to remove an attachment is to compose another message and copy and paste
the contents from the old message to the new message.</LI>

<LI>In the Address Book, if you type in a name in the type down field and
select it and press Delete, the name in the type down field doesn't get
deleted. Instead, the address that is highlighted in the list of addresses
is deleted. </LI>

<LI>HTML in messages- Recipients of mail messages may see HTML tags in
the mail message if viewed using a mail reader besides Netscape Communicator
or Navigator. If sending to these recipients, uncheck the HTML Compose
Window option in the Mail and News Preferences dialog. This feature will
be improved in future releases. </LI>

<LI>Quote Messages is Not Automatic - When replying, users must click the
&quot;Quote Original&quot; toolbar button to get the contents to appear
in the Compose window. </LI>

<LI>&quot;No Pages to Print&quot; Error - The problem usually occurs if
you have just scrolled down to the bottom of a mail or news message. To
workaround, you need to scroll back to the top of the message. </LI>

<LI>System Halt with the Compose Window - If you get a system halt when
invoking the Compose window, rename <B>abook.nab</B> (Address Book file)
located in your users profile directory. Reported problems with the Address
Book becoming corrupted will be addressed in future releases. </LI>

<LI>Preference Settings - Some Preference settings are not completely implemented
yet. In such cases, this release uses the settings from Netscape Navigator
3.x. </LI>

<LI>Unreadable Columns in Address Book or Subscribe Dialog - When using
the Address Book or the Subscribe Dialog, all the columns may appear &quot;squished&quot;
to the left. You can remedy this by clicking on the &lt; and &gt; buttons
in the column heading area. </LI>

<LI>Add Name to Address Book - The Add to Address Book button in the Search
Phone Book dialog does not work. Selected names will not be added to the
Address Book. The workaround is to access the LDAP Search feature from
within the Address Book, select the desired name, and choose to compose
a message. Copy the address and then from the Address Book, add a new user
and paste address in the specified field. </LI>

<LI>Shortcut Keys on Windows NT 3.51 - Shortcut keys may not bring up the correct dialog
or perform the correct action. </LI>
</UL>

<H3>Messenger</H3>

<UL>
<LI>In the Message window, the File button on the toolbar does not work.
To file messages, choose File Message or Copy Message from the Message
menu.</LI>

<LI>After you get new messages, the message you had selected before downloading
stays current. To get to the first new (unread)&nbsp;message, click Next
Unread on the toolbar.</LI>

<LI>Netscape Message Center Icon - Clicking on the Netscape Message Center
icon next to the Total Messages display may halt your system. This problem
will be addressed in a future release. </LI>

<LI>Next Unread and the Trash Folder - If your Trash folder contains unread
messages and it happens to be the next folder in your list, Next Unread
might go to the Trash folder. </LI>

<LI>Mail Filters - If Communicator has not yet accessed a mail folder (and
built a summary file for it internally), a mail filter using that folder
may not correctly filter messages to that folder. The messages appear in
your Inbox rather than in the designated folder. </LI>

<LI>Setting Priority of Outgoing Mail - You can set the priority of outgoing
mail under the third tab in the Composition window. You must reselect the
addressing tab prior to sending the message, otherwise the priority reverts
back to Normal.</LI>

<H3><FONT SIZE=+0>Mail with IMAP&nbsp;Servers</FONT></H3>

<UL>
<LI>You can access IMAP4 Servers with this version of Communicator. However,
the functionality of using Communicator with IMAP4 servers is currently
limited to basic functionality.</LI>

<LI>Filing or Copying Messages - The only way to file messages on the server
is to drag and drop between the Folders window and the Message List window.
</LI>

<LI>Trash Folder Creation Message - You may get an error message about
creating the Trash folder when you first set up for IMAP. This is a harmless
message that you can ignore. The Trash folder does get created. </LI>

<LI>Inbox Icon in Taskbar showing Question Mark - After you log into the
IMAP4 server and get new mail, the Inbox icon in the taskbar may still display
a question mark. </LI>

<LI>Creating Folders - You cannot create or rename a folder with a space
in the folder name. An error message appears. Also, on some IMAP4 servers,
there have been reported problems with being able to create a folder. </LI>

<LI>Emptying Trash Folders - Emptying of the online Trash folder is not
working. However, there are reported problems of getting a General Protection
Fault error if you've manipulated folders and messages into the Trash folder
by drag and drop. </LI>

<LI>Cancelling Password Dialog - Ignore the error message that appears
when you cancel the password dialog . To get the password dialog again
and to re-enter your password, close and reopen the Message List window.
</LI>

<LI>Watched View - Once you switch to the Watched View, you cannot choose
another view from the View menu. You must open another folder and then
reopen the current one. </LI>

<LI>Searching All Mail Folders - Searching all mail folders does not find
items located in an online folder. </LI>

<LI>Accessing IMAP4 Server after long period - If you are away from your
machine for more than one hour or so and Messenger is running, you may
get a &quot;Socket Error&quot; message. The workaround is to exit and restart
the program. </LI>

<LI>Saving or Viewing Attachments - There are reported problems with saving
or viewing attachments in messages. </LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3><B>Collabra</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>The Remove News Host feature is not yet available</LI>

<LI>Search News Messages - Searching news messages is case sensitive.</LI>

<LI>Sending to Default News Server - Composing a message to a newsgroup
via the Compose menu item (as opposed to using To: News from within the
newsgroup) will send to the default server. You will get an error message
if the newsgroup isn't on your default server. The workaround is to compose
a message from within the Newsgroup so that the To: News toolbar or menu
item is available.</LI>

<LI>Accessing an Admin Server to Create and Moderate a Discussion Group<BR>
This feature is not implemented in this beta release. The workaround is
to create the newsgroups from Collabra Server. Please consult the Collabra
Server release documentation for instructions on creating and managing
newsgroups.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Conference</H3>

<UL>
<LI>When calling someone from the Address Book for the first time, Communicator
prompts you to enter a conference address. Enter <B>dls.netscape.com</B>
in the text field and make sure that DLS address radio button is checked.
</LI>

<LI>Conference needs to be running to receive calls. </LI>

<LI>Help within dialogs is not yet available, and the F1 key doesn't yet
produce help in all Conference tools.</LI>

<LI>Collaborative Browser does not work with Frame structures, JavaScripted
pages that require user action, and anchors linking different portions
of forms. </LI>

<LI>Collaborative Browser does not yet automatically open a new Navigator
window if you have the Address Book or Composer or the Collections window
running without the Navigator window running. </LI>

<LI>Each time you click the Search Directory, Communicator opens another
Navigator window</LI>

<LI>Calling a fictitious user generates a prompt to leave Voice Mail. </LI>

<LI>Calling a valid user that has selected Do Not Disturb does not generate
a prompt to leave voicemail. </LI>

<LI>Pending Invitation dialog status reports &quot;Disconnected&quot;.
</LI>

<LI>When calling a valid user already in a conference the &quot;Pending
Conference&quot; status reports &quot;Line busy, try again later&quot;
but does not generate a prompt to leave voicemail. </LI>

<LI>Placing a call to a user who does not have Conference running does
not generate a prompt to leave voicemail.</LI>

<LI>Pending Invitation dialog status reports Dial Tone. </LI>

<LI>Placing a call to a valid user that is running Conference but does
not accept or reject your call does not time out and prompt you to leave
voicemail. </LI>

<LI>Placing a direct Call (IP Address) to an invalid IP causes the incorrect
Dialog to appear. Select Cancel toclear this dialog. </LI>

<LI>The mute function with the half-duplex sound card and Auto-Switch selected
is not yet working. </LI>

<LI>Netscape Conference does not interoperate with CoolTalk or with the
Netscape 411 Server for CoolTalk.</LI>

<LI>Netscape Conference does not usually run across firewalls unless the
fiirewall is configured to allow UDP data to pass through.</LI>

<LI>Netscape provides a central DLS server. You may run your own DLS&nbsp;server,
but if you do you'll currently be restricted to calling within your 'realm'.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>Plug-ins</H3>

<UL>
<LI>Plug-ins currently do not redraw correctly after resizing the window.
</LI>

<LI>AVI or sound files (au,wav,aiff, or mid) that are attached from a local
disk drive in a mail message do not play. </LI>

<LI>Plug-ins from other companies installed in previous versions of Navigator
aren't automatically transferred over to Communicator. You need to re-install
these plug-ins.</LI>

new messages. To receive new messages, click Get New Messages button on
the toolbar.</LI>

<LI><B>Mail Notification</B> <B>application</B> - To launch this feature,
run Netscape Mail Notification from your Communicator program folder. This
notification runs minimized on the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 taskbar.
To set up this mail notification, right mouse click on the mail notification
icon in the taskbar. You can check to see if you have new mail (without
having Communicator loaded) or run mail directly from this icon. This mail
notification program remains loaded unless you exit by using the right
mouse menu. This feature does not work when your mail is set up for an
IMAP4 server. </LI>

<LI><B>Reuse Message List and Message Windows</B> - There is an option
to reuse the Message List and Message windows or open a new window when
another folder, discussion or message is selected. You can set this option

have just read. Forward, available from the Go menu, takes you to the messages
you've backtracked from. </LI>

<LI><B>Inbox Icon in the Netscape Taskbar </B>- Unlike Netscape Navigator
3.0x, displaying the Mail Inbox or the Netscape Message Center does not
automatically get new messages for you. To receive new messages, click
Get New Messages on the toolbar or the Message menu.</LI>

<LI><B>Filing or Copying Messages</B> - Instead of trying to display both
the Message window and a Message List window side by side to drag and drop
messages into folders, you can file (move) or copy messages directly from
the Message List window or from the Message window. Use the File toolbar
button to move messages into folders or use the commands from the Message
window. You can also file news messages into folders that you create to
capture information you want to refer to later. </LI>

<LI><B>&quot;More&quot; feature</B> - You can press the spacebar to read
through all your unread messages. </LI>

<LI><B>Send Later</B> - You can defer sending of your messages by choosing
the Send Later command under the Message menu. Choosing Send Later places your message
into the Outbox folder.
You can send the outgoing messages by choosing Message | Send in Outbox
from the Netscape Message Center or from the Outbox's Message List window when
you are online. </LI>

<LI><B>Drafts</B> - You can save messages that you are in the process of
composing. From within the Composition window, click the Draft toolbar
button. You can continue composing your message and then send it. Or, you
can close the Composition window and then go into the Drafts folder and
select the draft you saved. Double-click the draft and the Composition
window appears for you to modify the message and send it. </LI>

<LI><B>Filters</B> - Filter support allow you to organize your incoming
messages. Use Mail Filter Rules in the Edit menu to create filters. </LI>

<LI><B>Views</B> - You can display four different views in the Thread window.
They are: New, Watched, Ignored, and All. Use the Threads command in the
View menu to change views to one of these options:<BR>
<B>New</B> - Only unread messages appear. If your messages are sorted by
thread and the unread message is a reply, the &quot;parent&quot; of this
reply also displays. <BR>
<B>Watched</B> - Only new messages which belong to a thread that is marked
&quot;watched&quot; (using Watch Thread from the Message menu) appears
in this view. For example:&nbsp;When you only have time to read new messages
for the threads that you've marked watched, you can access those threads
directly by choosing the Watched view after getting new mail or opening
a newsgroup.<BR>
<B>Ignored</B> - All messages, including messages which belong to a thread
that is marked &quot;ignored&quot; (Ignore Thread command in the Message
menu)l appear in this view. <BR>
<B>All</B> - All messages, except ignored threads, appear in this view. <BR>
Note: When switching views, you may not see any changes because the views
are cached. If this occurs, use the &quot;All&quot; view and select another
message to clear the cache or close and reopen the folder or newsgroup.
</LI>

<LI><B>Showing More Columns in the Thread Window</B> - Communicator defaults
to showing a specified set of columns in the Netscape Message Center and
the Netscape Message List window. You can increase or decrease the number of
columns shown by clicking on the &lt; or &gt; buttons at the right of the
column headings. </LI>

<LI><B>Choose Newsgroup Dialog</B> - There is a new dialog for adding news
servers and adding newsgroups. The Choose Newsgroup... command is available
in the File menu of the Netscape Message Center. We will be adding more
features to this dialog. As an alternative, you can also add a newsgroup
with the Add Newsgroup command in the File menu, just as in Navigator 3.0.
