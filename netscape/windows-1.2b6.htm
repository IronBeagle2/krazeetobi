   <LI>If you are running Windows 3.1 or WFW, you must use the 16-bit Navigator even if 
        you have Win32s installed.<P> 
   <LI>If you are running Windows 95 or Windows NT, use the 32-bit 
        Navigator.  Make sure you have a 32-bit winsock application.

<UL> 
   <LI><B>Windows 95 features:</B> The Betas of the Navigator include support for the 
        following Windows 95 requirements: 
	<UL>	<LI>Windows 95 look, including tabbed dialogs and proportional scroll bars.
                <LI>Long filename support. </UL> 
<P>
   <LI><B>Drop-down URL Menu:</B>
	New to Beta four was a drop down menu for the Location/Netsite field.  This lists 
	saves all URLs typed into the field.  Beta 5 includes a scroll bar for the list.
<P> 
   <LI><B>Printing Performance:</B> 
	Printing has been optimized in beta 4 and later. Printing speed should be comparable or better 
        than ver 1.1. 
<P> 
   <LI><B>MAPI:</B> 
        Win95 users (running the 32bit navigator) can use Microsoft Exchange for sending/receiving  
	mail and posting news.  To enable this feature, you need to go to the Mail and News tab in 
	Options/Preferences and make sure "Use exchange client for mail and news" is checked.  For 
        installation instructions, see the Readme. 
<P> 
   <LI><B>Page Headers:</B> 
        You now have the option to Print Page Headers, which will include the Document Title 
        and/or the URL on every printed page.  You can turn this option off from File/Page Setup. 
<P> 
   <LI><B>New Bookmark Interface:</B>  By popular request, the interface to the 
        bookmark file has been rewritten for 1.2. 
<P> 
   <LI><B>Registry instead of <tt>NETSCAPE.INI</tt> for the 32-bit version:</B> 
        There is no <tt>NETSCAPE.INI</tt> file for the 32-bit version.   
        <P> 
        The 32-bit version now uses the system registry.  The purpose of the  
	registry is to incorporate all the configuration information into registration database 
        file for controlled access. 
	<P>
        To manually edit the Preferences, run <tt>regedit.exe</tt> . 
        Preferences are stored under 
        <tt>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Netscape\Netscape Navigator</tt> . 
<P> 
   <LI><B>Multi-user Preferences in Windows 95 and Windows NT:</B> 
        If you share your computer with other users, you can personalize 
        your Netscape Preferences settings so that your own settings will 
        be restored when you log on. The next person who logs on to 
        Windows can modify his/her own settings without affecting yours. 
        <P> 
        In order to enable this multi-user settings feature 
        in Windows 95, you need to 
        modify your Win95's User Profile option, which locates in the 
        Control Panel Passwords property.  Make sure the second option 
        in your User Profile, which allows users to customize preferences 
        and desktop settings, is checked. 
        <P> 
        For Windows NT, you don't have to do anything.  Each user automatically 
        gets their own Netscape Preferences setting. 
        <P> 
        The default values for the Netscape Preferences will be the same for 
        each user.  Initially, all users will be set up to share the same 
        bookmarks, cache, cookie, global history, newsrc and temporary directories. 
        If you do not wish to share these files, change the Preference settings 
        to point to your own private copies of the 
        files.  To change the location of cookie and global history files, 
        you need to edit the Registry directly.  The other files and directories 
        can be set under the Options Menu - Preferences. 
<P> 
   <LI><B>FTP Featurette: </B>Now Netscape is smarter when the protocol 
        identifier is not specified when entering a URL into the location field.  If the hostname 
        is ftp or gopher, Netscape will use those particular protocols.  Otherwise 
	Netscape will default to http. 
         <BR>Example:<BR> 
        <DD>Entering: <TT>ftp.netscape.com</TT><BR> 
        <DD>Will give: <TT>ftp://ftp.netscape.com</TT> 
        <P> 
        When logging in to your ftp account, Netscape will now automatically go 
        to your home directory; instead of the root directory.

</CENTER>
 
<DL>
<DT><B>Color Palette Problems</B>
  <DD>If you are running 256 colors and have a Windows background image, minimizing then
	restoring Netscape, might cause images and the Netscape logo to appear in strange colors.  To
	fix the problem, open a new Netscape window or remove the Windows background image.
<P> 
 
<DT><B>MAPI</B> 
  <DD>You can't include OLE objects in messages. 
	<BR> Rich text format is not supported.
	<BR> You must have mail text if you want to send an attachment.
	<BR> You can't embed a Microsoft Exchange mail within your e-mail.
<P> 
<DT><B> Text Color </B> 
  <DD>There is still a problem that if the background and text colors are 
        the same selections will not show up (since we indicate selected 
        text by flipping the text and background colors).  For this reason 
        <B>we strongly recommend that authors set both text and background colors</B> 
   	when using images as page backdrops.
<P>                                        
<DT><B>Backgrounds and Transparency</B> 
  <DD>In 16 color VGA mode, images with transparent backgrounds do not show 
        properly over other background images. Instead of transparent, the 
        background is opaque, usually black.  
<P> 
<DT><B>Image Display Bugs</B> 
  <DD> For video boards with Cirrus Logic video chip sets on them, and possibly for 
        other makers, an image can be displayed that may occasionally cause the 
        program to "freeze" or GP Fault in the video driver.  If this happens, 
        ensure you are using the latest versions of drivers for your video board. 
        You can download the latest version of the Cirrus Logic video driver from their ftp site 
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cirrus.com">ftp://ftp.cirrus.com</a>
  <P> 
  <DD>When a page (with an image on it) is re-sized so that the horizontal scroll 
        bar appears, sometimes the right edge of the image does not draw all the way 
        to the right edge of the window.  The width of the vertical blank area on 
        the right is about the width of the left margin, and is the color of the 
	background.
  <P> 
  <DD>When the video driver is in 4, 16, or 24 bits per pixel mode, drawing 
        transparent images over backdrop images may have black flicker during drawing. 
        This does not happen when video mode is 8 bits per pixel. 
  <P> 
<DT><B>Asynchronous DNS</B> 
  <DD>If you think your winsock is not handling Async DNS correctly, try 
        setting the Async option in the Windows 95 Registry or NETSCAPE.INI file to "no," 
	<pre>
    [Network]
    use Async DNS=no </pre>
        The default is to use Async DNS, not using it will result in lower 
        performance and can cause problems when multiple simultaneous 
        connections are attempted.  You can also set 
	<pre>
    [Network]
    Max Connections=1</pre>which will prevent problems when not using Async DNS but will also 
        result in much slower performance. 
        <P> 
        PC-NFS from Sun and Spry's newly updated stack are the only winsocks we 
        know of that require setting the "Async DNS" flag to "no". 
        <P> 
 
 
<DT><B>Bookmarks</B> 
  <DD>If you have 3 folders in a row, you can't shuffle them 
        using drag and drop or cut/copy/paste. 
        Moving an item immediately after a folder/header 
        will put the item IN the folder instead of AFTER it. 
        You can, however, close the folder, highlight it, and then INSERT 
        items after it.  Then you 
        can drag other folders and bookmarks after that item you INSERT-ed. 
  <P> 
        Using the Properties window to remove the Name of a Bookmark or Header 
        will remove it from the menu.  Restoring the Name will restore the item 
        to the bookmark menu. 
  <P> 
        The unsupported Mozilize utility doesn't convert hierarchical NCSA Mosaic 
        hotlists. 
<P> 
<DT><B>Preferences</B> 
  <DD>The Apply and Help buttons in Preferences are grayed out and don't work.

	using the navigator. <BR>URL:  <A HREF="snews://secnews.netscape.com/netscape.navigator">

<P>
   <DT><B>Delete Cache Before Upgrading</B>
	<DD>When upgrading to 1.2 it is recommended that you flush 
	your disk cache to remove any incorrect information that may have been
	saved by an earlier release of the Netscape Navigator.
<P>
   <DT><B>Right Mouse Pop-up Note</B>
	<DD>A Bookmarks menu no longer appear in the right-mouse pop-up menu.
<P> 
   <DT><B>Running the 32-bit version on Win95</B>
	<DD>If you get an error message "Netscape was unable to create network socket connection
 	(Reason 10047)," it is probably because you are trying to run the 32-bit version of Netscape 
	using a 16-bit winsock application.  To run the 32-bit version of Netscape, you need a 
	32-bit winsock application.    Win95 comes with a 32-bit TCP/IP stack, but you need to install it.
<P>
   <DT><B>Could not open a News RC file Message</B>
	<DD>If you receive this message when trying to use news, you must specify a valid path for the 
	NewsRC= line in the netscape.ini (if your using 16-bit) or registry (32-bit).  This line is in 
	the [Main] section.  Note: The News RC Directory line in Preferences/Mail and News changes the 
	NewsDirectory= line in the ini or registry.
<P> 
   <DT><B>Audio Player Note</B> 
	<DD>The Netscape Setup program will not delete your old Netscape audio player (NAPLAYER.EXE).  
	If you don't have version 1.2 of the audio player, you must delete the old Netscape audio player  
        (version 1.1) and reinstall Netscape to get the new version. 
<P> 
   <DT><B>Export Only</B> 
	<DD>This release is exportable, and you will not be able to connect to using high-grade encryption 
        keys. 
<P> 
   <DT><B>Norton Desktop 3.0</B> 
        <DD>Turn FileAssist OFF if you are having problems using Netscape's Find function. 
<P> 
   <DT><B>Highlighting more than one Screen</B> 
	<DD>To highlight more than one screen of text in a document, position the mouse where you want 
        to start selecting text. Hold the mouse button down while pressing the down arrow key. 
<P>
   <DT><B>Importing Hotlists as Bookmarks</B> 
	<DD>Netscape has an import command on the Bookmarks window that will read any HTML file 
	containing links and convert those links into bookmarks. If you would like to import
	your NCSA Hotlist into Netscape, you can use the 
	<AHREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/">Mozilize</A>
 	utility to convert your hotlist to a Netscape style bookmark list.  This program is 
        unsupported so your results may vary. 
<P> 
   <DT><B>Helper Applications</B> 
	<DD>For telnet, ftp, and for displaying audio and video, Netscape uses "Helper Applications". 
	These applications are configured in your Preferences window. For help configuring this window, 
        check out our documentation: 
        <a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/index.html">Helper Applications</A> 
<P> 
	On Windows, LVIEW31.EXE (for JPEG images), MPEGPLAY.EXE (for MPEG movies), and  WHAM.EXE 
	(for audio files) are all useful applications. One site where these can be found is
	<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu">ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu</A>, but that site is often
	difficult to reach. You can also try the mirror site on
        <A HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/"> 
        ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/</A>.

<P> 
   <DT><B>How do I use Netscape without a network connection?</B> 
	<DD>If you do not have a network connection but still want to use Netscape to browse local 
	files you should get the file <A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/mozock.dll">
	mozock.dll</A>.  If you install this file as winsock.dll Netscape will work fine with local 
	file reads.  Be sure to shift-click on the above link or else Netscape will treat it as a text 
        document.  Doh! If you want to get out to the rest of the net mozock.dll is not for you. 
<P> 
   <DT><B>What happened to the Background "Fade-in" and multiple text colors?</B> 
	<DD>Previous versions of the Navigator would recognize multiple &lt;BODY&gt; tags.  
	This allowed people to "fade-in" pages or have multiple text colors.  This was a bug in the 
	Navigator. The &lt;BODY&gt; tag is specifically designed to separate the header and footer 
	from the body of a page.  It is illegal HTML to have more than one &lt;BODY&gt; tag per page.
	The newer versions of the Navigator will only recognize the first &lt;BODY&gt; tag. 
        Later ones will be ignored.
