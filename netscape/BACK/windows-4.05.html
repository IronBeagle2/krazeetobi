What's New in 4.05</H2></CENTER>
Communicator 4.05 contains a fix for the Preferences bug, which can allow
malicious Web site operators to guess the full pathname to the Communicator
<TT>prefs.js</TT> file to read <TT>prefs.js</TT> from visiting users' hard
disk through an obscure series of steps. For more information on this bug,
please go to <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/assist/security/content_content.html">http://home.netscape.com/assist/security/content_content.html</A>.

<H3>
General</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Users of the JDK 1.1 SmartUpdate or installer packages that require AWT
1.1 support should avoid updating to 4.05 to avoid reverting back to AWT
1.0 functionality. A 4.05 update that includes AWT 1.1 is available
on the DevEdge Site at <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com/software/jdk/download.html">http://developer.netscape.com/software/jdk/download.html</A>.</LI>

<LI>
If you are using an applet that uses RMI callbacks, you must call <TT>netscape.security.PrivilegeManager.enablePrivilege("UniversalConnect")</TT>
before the your first call into the RMI runtime.</LI>
</UL>
<A NAME="Known Navigator"></A>
<H3>
Navigator</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
If you are running Netscape Communicator on Windows NT 3.51 using a Matrox
Millennium graphics driver, an application error may occur when viewing
HTML pages. Obtain an updated version of the driver (version 2.25 or later).</LI>

<LI>
Navigator only supports Microsoft Exchange 5.0 or later.</LI>

<LI>
After entering a URL that does not exist, avoid clicking the Stop button
before Navigator notifies you that no DNS entry has been found. If you
do click the Stop button, no more URLs will be found by Navigator. If this
occurs, restart Communicator. A simple workaround is to wait until Navigator
notifies you that it does not exist.</LI>

<LI>
Transparency does not function correctly. If an image has a background
chunk, it will be visible in transparent areas and the page background
will not show through. To turn on background image printing, choose Page
Setup from the File menu and enable the Print Backgrounds option.</LI>

<LI>
If a system halt related to the Kernel32.dll occurs, update the kernel.
You can obtain the update from <A HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q148/3/36.asp">http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q148/3/36.asp</A>.
This may correct the problem.</LI>

<LI>
If you uninstalled beta versions of Communicator (Preview Release 5 or
earlier) on Windows NT systems, you may experience trouble running <TT>.avi</TT>,
<TT>.wav</TT>, <TT>.mid</TT>, or <TT>.rmi</TT> files.</LI>

<BR>To fix the problem:
<OL>
<LI>
Open the Control Panel and select one of the following:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
For NT 3.51, select Drivers.</LI>

<LI>
For NT 4.0, select Multimedia - Devices.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Add the following drivers if they are not already listed: (MCI) CD Audio,
(MCI) Microsoft Video for Windows,&nbsp; (MCI) Midi Sequencer, and (MCI)
Sound.</LI>

<LI>
Run <TT>regedt32.exe</TT> and navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\MCI Extensions.</LI>

<LI>
Select Add Value from the Edit menu; for Value Name enter <TT>avi</TT>,
and for String enter <TT>avivideo</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>wav</TT>, and for String
enter <TT>waveaudio</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>mid</TT>, and for String
enter <TT>Sequencer</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
Select Add Value and for Value Name enter <TT>rmi</TT>, and for String
enter <TT>Sequencer</TT>. You don't need to modify the data type.</LI>
</OL>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
In a frame document, only the activated frame is printed, because only
one frame can be printed at a time. To activate a frame, click on it.</LI>

<LI>
Printing documents with applets, plugins, and webfonts on layer do not
work properly.</LI>

<LI>
The paddings property of Style Sheets is not supported. Use topPadding,
rightPadding, bottomPadding, and leftPadding instead.</LI>

<LI>
The margins property of Style Sheets is not supported. Use leftMargin,
rightMargin, and bottomMargin instead.</LI>

<LI>
Width, height, and border tags for images in Style Sheets are not enabled.</LI>

<LI>
Under certain circumstances in a table cell, the EMBED tag parameter ALIGN=RIGHT
causes the plugin not to be loaded or displayed. As a workaround, insert
the ALIGN=RIGHT parameter in the table column and/or row descriptors.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Composer</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Starting Composer from the command line with <TT>netscape -edit</TT> (or
double clicking on the Composer icon) does not start a new window if any
other Communicator window is already active.</LI>

<LI>
Windows 95 and Windows 3.1 users: It is strongly recommended that you avoid
adding images larger than 1 MB to the Composer window. Doing so may cause
Communicator to halt.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
<B>Messenger</B></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
If you encounter a general protection fault in <TT>msvcrt.dll</TT> when
sending a message, exit Communicator.&nbsp; This is caused by a <TT>.tmp</TT>
file Windows limitation. See your system administrator or equivalent about
removing these <TT>.tmp</TT> files from the Windows temp folder. Afterwards,
you can send messages from Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
If a system halt occurs when invoking the Compose window, rename the address
book file (<TT>abook.nab</TT>) located in the Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;username>
directory.</LI>

<LI>
A message saved as plain text (with a .txt extension) will be converted
into plain text instead of in original MIME format. If you save the message
to an existing file, the existing file will be replaced instead of having
the message appended to it.</LI>

<LI>
If you get an error regarding expired certificates when sending/receiving
signed or encrypted mail, please go to <A HREF="http://www.verisign.com/update/faq/index.html">http://www.verisign.com/update/faq/index.html</A>
to update your certificate.</LI>

<LI>
If you make changes to the Advanced S/MIME Cipher Preferences in the Messenger
tab of the Security Advisor dialog box, you must communicate these changes
to people that you exchange encrypted mail with. To update their Certificate
database information about you, send them a signed message. If you send
only encrypted messages, they will not be aware of your preference changes.</LI>

<LI>
The file format for certificate import and export has changed between Communicator
4.03 and 4.04 due to the standardization of PKCS 12. Communicator 4.04
and newer imports certificates exported with older versions of Communicator.
However, older versions of Communicator will not be able to import files
exported with Communicator 4.04 or newer.</LI>

<LI>
When downloading a user certificate, you will be able to save the certificate
for backup purposes. If the certificate chain does not yet exist on the
user's machine, the certificate will be exported without the certificate
chain. In this case, it is highly recommended that you save the certificate
after retrieving the certificate chain by going into the Security Advisor,
selecting Your Certificates and exporting the desired certificate.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Plug-ins</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
In 8-bit (256 color mode), you might experience color pallete problems
while loading some plug-ins in Communicator. If this happens, minimize
and then restore the window, or open a new Navigator window from the "File"
menu to fix this. Running Windows in 16-bit (high color) mode will completely
eliminate this problem.</LI>

<LI>
Sound files greater than 6MB are not supported in the 16 bit version and
may not play back properly.</LI>

<LI>
Plug-ins installed in versions of Navigator prior to 4.0 are not automatically transferred to Communicator. Furthermore, for plug-ins to be automatically transferred from a prior 4.0x installation, the new version of Communicator must be installed into the same directory as the version from which you are upgrading. (If you install into a different directory, your plug-ins must be re-installed.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Netcaster</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Java and JavaScript must be enabled to run Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
It is recommended that you select the Go Offline option from the File Menu
before viewing sites offline.</LI>

<LI>
The order of the channels in the selector may change after exiting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
The Automatically Load Images preference (Preferences, Advanced from the
Edit menu) should be checked.</LI>

<LI>
If you specify an invalid URL when adding a channel, the channel is added
under My Channels, but does not appear when you select it. A green light
may also appear; ignore this light.</LI>

<LI>
If you change a webtop to a channel in Channel Properties, the webtop remains
on your screen. Close the webtop and when you select it again in My Channels,
it appears as a channel in a Navigator window.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your Communicator preferences, such as color or font, while
Netcaster is open, a system halt may occur. Change your Communicator preferences
before starting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
The buttons in the Netcaster window may disappear depending on the font
you select.</LI>

<LI>
Select a channel before modifying any security information in the Options
dialog.</LI>

<LI>
Your channel settings may not be preserved if Communicator terminates abnormally.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your screen's resolution while Netcaster is running, the
Netcaster window may no longer be visible.</LI>

<LI>
The display and cache size of the Castanet channels cannot be modified.</LI>

<LI>
If you add a Castanet channel by specifying its IP address and then access
the channel again by specifying its DNS name, Netcaster will attempt to
resubscribe to the channel.</LI>

<LI>
Unless you specifically use the Update Now command to update a channel,
at most, two channels will update at the same time.</LI>

<LI>
Some of the channel preferences may not be visible until you restart Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
If you add two channels with the same name, an error may occur.</LI>

<LI>
You cannot move a webtop, as indicated in the Netcaster NetHelp.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>SmartUpdate</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
If you are using SmartUpdate to upgrade from a previous 4.0x version of
Communicator, you may see the following error:</LI>

<BR><TT>Error extracting values from registry - you must re-install your
current version before performing the upgrade.</TT>
<BR>If you do not wish to re-install your current version, you can simply
download the full Communicator 4.05 installer located at <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/download">http://home.netscape.com/download</A>.
</UL>

<H3>Web Publisher</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The Web Publisher shipping with Enterprise Server 3.0 will need to be upgraded
to work with Communicator 4.05 and higher. If the Web Publisher does not
start correctly with Communicator, please contact your Enterprise Server
administrator to install the new Web Publisher. To download this patch,
please go to <A HREF="http://help.netscape.com/filelib.html">http://help.netscape.com/filelib.html</A>.</LI>
