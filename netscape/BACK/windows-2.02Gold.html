<h3 align=center><font SIZE=+2>R</font>EQUIREMENTS </h3>

<p>To run the 32bit Navigator, you MUST have a 32-bit TCP/IP stack. Both
Windows 95 and Windows NT provide 32bit TCP/IP stacks that you can setup.
If you need help setting up the TCP/IP stack in Windows 95, see <a href="http://www.windows95.com" TARGET="_top">http://www.windows95.com.</a>

<h3 align=center><a name="Security2"></a><font SIZE=+2>S</font>ECURITY
IN <font SIZE=+2>2.02</font></h3>

<h4>Summary Technical Background: </h4>

<p>Netscape has implemented fixes to the portions of our software containing
these problems and reviewed them with outside experts. By adding more explicit
checks to the Java Applet Security Manager, applets in Netscape Navigator
2.02 will be correctly restricted from making any network connections to
hosts other than the Java host. Similarly, JavaScript will now be correctly
limited from listing the files of a directory and limited from automatically
posting mail and news form elements. Netscape has also improved the safety
of URL parsing by disallowing gopher connections to non-standard ports
and by searching for new line characters in gopher URL strings and stopping
URLs containing such characters from being executed. </p>

<h4>Relating to Java: </h4>

<p>A potential vulnerability existed in Netscape Navigator 2.0 that could
allow a Java applet to take advantage of weaknesses in the Domain Name
Service (DNS) and connect over the network to an arbitrary computer. When
a Java applet is downloaded over the network, the Java Applet Security
Manager will only allow an applet to set up the network connection to an
IP address matching the address of the Java host. By using the DNS server
to advertise multiple IP addresses for the Java host, where one of the
addresses really belongs to a different computer, the Java Applet Security
Manager could be tricked into connecting to a computer other than the Java
host. Netscape Navigator 2.02 improves the checking of computer names and
IP addresses so that it will only allow an applet to make a network connection
to the Java Host. </p>

<p>A flaw in the implementation of the Java applet class loader could have
allowed an applet to bypass certain security checks in limited circumstances
where file uploads were possible. Netscape Navigator 2.02 solves this problem
by making sure any files accessed by the class loader are subject to the
complete suite of security checks. </p>

<h4>Relating to JavaScript: </h4>

<p>A user's email address is currently made available to JavaScript. Because
of the automation of certain JavaScript functions, a user's email addresses
could have been inadvertently exposed to individuals without the user knowing
it, compromising the user's privacy. Netscape Navigator 2.02 solves this
privacy problem by limiting JavaScript's ability to automatically post
mail or news from form elements. This ensures that user interaction is
required to send mail or post news messages. </p>

<p>Another feature of JavaScript is the ability for a server script to
list files and directories. Due to an implementation problem in Netscape
Navigator 2.0, a privacy concern existed because it was possible for a
server script to access the listing of local file names and directories
on the user's machine. This problem did not allow the server to see the
contents of any local files or modify local files in any way. Navigator
2.02 fixes this problem by refusing to allow a script from a server to
view file names and directory listings from the local user's machine. </p>

<h4>Relating to Ports: </h4>

<p>2.02 fixes a problem where it was possible for a Gopher URL to be used
to send commands to ports other than those that were reasonable for the
Gopher service. It was possible that this feature could be used to exploit
other security vulnerabilities behind firewalls. Navigator 2.02 fixes this
problem by limiting the ports that a Gopher URL can access and by disallowing
certain control characters in a valid Gopher URL<font SIZE=+2>. </font></p>

<li>FTP&nbsp;URLs can now specify a relative path instead of specifying
a path from the root directory. This is especially useful when specifying
an upload directory. For example, suppose you have a directory called <b><tt><font SIZE=-1>public_html</font></tt></b>
in which you store your html files. Normally using the browser, you would
have to specify the absolute path <b><tt><font SIZE=-1>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/public/lloyd/public_html</font></tt></b>.
Instead, you can specify a relative path with <b><tt><font SIZE=-1>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/./public_html</font></tt></b>.
The <b><tt><font SIZE=-1>/./ </font></tt></b>replaces <b><tt><font SIZE=-1>/public/lloyd/</font></tt></b>
in the URL. This is important because over time, your absolute path may
change, but the relative path will always remain the same.</li>

<li>Shortcut keys: </li>

P</font>ROBLEMS</h3>

<li>Printing: </li>

<ul>
<li>Cannot cancel print during formatting stage (on print progress dialog).
Application will hang.</li>
</ul>

<li>Images: </li>

<ul>
<li>Inserting images: When you click the Original Size button in the Image
Properties dialog box, the dimensions display as 0 (zero). This is temporary
and does not affect the original size of the image. Click OK or Apply to
exit the dialog box. Select the image you inserted and then display the
Image Properties dialog box again to view the correct dimensions. </li>

<li>Changes made by resizing an image through an external image editor
aren't automatically reflected in the editor. Use the Image Properties
dialog box to adjust the dimensions as well.</li>
</ul>

<li>On some systems, once you change the font size in the Options|General|Fonts
preference panel you cannot change it back. Workaround:&nbsp;choose another
font, and then reset the font and font size. </li>

<li>Tables with multiple columns display as one long column.</li>

<li>If you have Plug-ins on your regular installation of the Netscape Navigator,
you must repeat the installation procedure for Navigator Gold (unless you
install Navigator Gold in the same directory)</li>

<li>If you edit a document that has invalid HTML, it may appear differently
in the browser than in the editor.</li>

<li>International character support:&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Although doublebyte input is supported, inline input is not. </li>

<li>On multibyte systems, buttons in some dialog boxes will display incorrectly.
For example, if you install Navigator Gold on a machine running Japanese
Win95 or NT 3.51, the&nbsp;Cancel, Apply, and Help buttons appear as garbage
characters.</li>

<ul>
<li>One-Button Publishing: Transfer all the files, links, images, and pages
used to create a site at the touch of a button. Select which files or directories
you want to upload (publish) to a remote server quickly and easily.</li>

<li>Multi-level Undo function allows up to 20 levels of Undo and Redo for
greater control over editing.</li>

<li>Drag-and-drop links and images from the Bookmarks, Mail, News, or browse
windows to a document in the editor. You can also drag and drop an image
file (.GIF or .JPG) from the Windows File Manager (Explorer in Windows
95) and drop it in an edit window to create a link to that file.</li>

<li>Insert raw HTML: Use the HTML&nbsp;Tag dialog box (choose HTML&nbsp;Tag
from the&nbsp;Insert menu) to insert HTML&nbsp;tags not available from
the editor's format menus. The editor checks to make sure you have both
opening and closing brackets around your tags. This can be used to add
Java applets and Netscape plug-ins.</li>

<li>International support: The editor supports high ASCII and multibyte
(e.g., Japanese) input. To regularly create and view documents in encodings
other than Latin1, set the Options|Document Encoding menu to the appropriate
encoding, and then select Options|Save Options.</li>

<li>Set options for text, links, images, characters, documents, and paragraphs
with items from the Properties menu.</li>

<li>Create targets (named anchors) to link to specific places within a

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<p>Built-in JavaScript: Netscape Navigator now includes a built-in scripting
language, called JavaScript. JavaScript development is based on the JAVA
language, which extends and enhances the capability of HTML documents.
JavaScript supports most of JAVA's expression syntax and basic control
flow constructs, but without JAVA's strong type checking and static typing.
JavaScript is embedded in HTML documents with a SCRIPT tag, and there is
no compilation needed to run the script.

JavaScript Documentation</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Mail"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Read Mail with Netscape Navigator</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reading your email: A new Mail Window allows you to read your email,
sort the messages, file them in folders, and mail replies.</li>

<li>New Mail Reading Window: The Mail Window has 3 panes: a mail folder
pane, a message list pane, and a message text pane. You can adjust the
relative sizes of the panes by dragging the pane dividers. You may want
to start by making the mail folder pane a little wider so that you can
see the names of the mail folders. The individual columns in each pane
can be adjusted. Hold the mouse over the column titles. A corner will activate
when you're at the end of a column title. You can drag and drop the corner
to resize the columns.</li>

<p>Netscape comes with a sample mail message. Click on the &quot;Inbox&quot;
folder to see the message. You can use the toolbar button or menu to Get
New Mail. You can navigate through your mail messages by clicking on the
&quot;Date&quot;, &quot;Sender&quot;, or &quot;Subject&quot; fields of
the message list pane. The buttons and Go Menu also help you navigate.</p>

<p>A bold message in the message list signifies that you have not read
this message yet. Once you read it, it becomes normal (i.e. unbold).</p>

<li>Send Now or Send Later - Deferred Mail: Netscape allows you to compose
all your email offline and then send them all at once. When you're in the
Message Composition Window, select Deferred Delivery from the Options menu.
Deffered mail is stored in the OUTBOX folder. When you exit the Mail Window,
you will be asked if you want the messages to be sent. You can also choose
&quot;File&quot; | &quot;Send Mail in Outbox&quot; (from the Netscape Mail
Window), to send all your deferred Mail. </li>

<li>Organizing your Mail: The Sort Menu allows you to view your list of
messages in various ways. You can even thread the messages by subject.
The Edit Menu lets you select and delete messages. Deleted messages are
put in a mail folder called &quot;trash&quot;. You can create other mail
folders with the File Menu.</li>

<li>Mail Password: Netscape Mail remembers your mail password. To enable
this feature, check the &quot;Remember Mail Password&quot; on the Organization
panel of the mail and news preferences.</li>

<li>New Mail Indicator: There is a mail preference &quot;Check for mail
every <i>n</i> minutes&quot; on the Servers panel of the mail and news
preferences. As long as the Navigator is running it will check for new
mail at the specified frequency. If there is new mail, the mail will not
be automatically downloaded; the mail indicator in the lower right corner
of the Browser, Mail, and News windows will change appearance. Click the
mail indicator to open the Mail window and retrieve new mail.</li>

<li>Find: You can search for text in the headers of mail and news messages
using the Find command located on the Edit menu. Find searches the displayed
headers of the messages in the current folder, starting with the current
message. Use Find Again to continue with the next message. </li>
</ul>

<p>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Improved News Reading Interface</h3>

<ul>
<li>Improved News Reading Window: The News Reader now provides a more concise
view of the news hosts, newsgroups, and articles. It uses the same type
of 3-paned window that the Mail reader uses. Your existing <tt>newsrc</tt>file
is compatible with the new news interface.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Reading News articles: Reading news is very much like reading mail
messages. Instead of Getting New Mail, you can click on the newsgroup to
bring up the list of articles and see the new ones that have arrived. </li>

<p><a name="Compose"></a></p>

<p>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Message Composition Window</h3>

<li>Updated Mail and News Composition: A new Mail and News composition
window lets you send new messages, and reply to or forward existing messages.
Use the Options Menu | Show All Headers command to find fields for carbon
copy, blind carbon copy (Bcc:), and file carbon copy (Fcc:) where you can
save a copy for yourself.</li>

<li>Link to the address book: You can type the names of users or mailing
lists into the To:, CC:, and BCC: fields. When you click on a new field
with the mouse, or hit tab, the email addresses will be expanded. Double-clicking
on an entry in the address book will bring up a new Composition window,
addressed to that address.</li>

<li>Multiple Attachments: The Attach button lets you add and delete multiple
attachments to your email message, including both local files and URLs.
</li>

<li>AppleDouble Attachments: Files sent as attachments from the Macintosh
version of the Navigator are sent using AppleDouble encoding, which allows
for the preservation of Macintosh file forks. On Windows and Unix versions
of Navigator, you have the option of receiving these attachments as either
a Macintosh file, which can be saved and transferred for use on a Macintosh,
or as a data file which can be used on the receiving platform.</li>

<li>More Options: Look at the Options Menu | Mail and News... | Compose
pane for more mail composition options. </li>

<p><a name="Addressbook"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Address Book </h3>

<li>Address Book Window: The address book looks and works very much like
the bookmarks. You can view the whole address book by going to the Window
Menu and choosing Address Book. </li>

<p>Add Users from the Address Book Window's Item Menu, or automatically
create an entry from the Message Menu in the Mail or News window. </p>

<p>Do you have lists of people to send mail to? In the Address Book window,
mailing lists are represented by the folder icon. Add list entries from
the Address Book Window's Item menu, then drag and drop individual users
into the list/folders. </p>

<p>You can use these List and User entries in three ways. You can type
the nicknames into the mail composition window in the To:, CC:, and BCC:
fields. You can also double-click on an icon in the Address Book window
to bring up a pre-addressed composition window. </p>

<p><a name="Bookmarks"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>New Bookmarks Feature </h3>

<li>Checks for changed Bookmarks: In Bookmark window, There is a What's
New? menu item in the File menu that brings up a window that you can use
to identify bookmarks that have changed since you last visited them. You
can choose to check all bookmarks in the bookmark list, or just the selected
bookmarks and bookmarks inside selected folders. </li>

<p><a name="Images"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Better Images and Document Presentation</h3>

<li>Frames -- Multiple documents on one page: Frames are a way of specifying
multiple, independent, scrollable regions within a display window. Each
frame can contain a separate HTML document. Users can scroll and resize
frames, at the choice of the page creator. Each frame can also be given
NAME values, so they can be targeted by links in other documents or other
frames. These features provide a powerful new way of presenting documents.</li>

<p><a href="http://home.mcom.com/assist/net_sites/frames.html">Frame Development
Information</a></p>

<p><a href="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/frames/index.html">Cool
Examples of Frames</a></p>

<li>Targeted Windows: Browser windows can now have names associated with
them. Links in any window can refer to another window by name. When you
click on the link, the document you asked for will appear in that named
window. If the window is not already open, Netscape will open and name
a new window for you. They are especially useful with frames.</li>

<p>A new BASE tag allows you to pick a default named target window for
every link in a document that does not have an explicit TARGET attribute.
It's format is: </p>

<p>&lt;BASE TARGET=&quot;default_target&quot;&gt;</p>

<li>Client-Side Image Maps: We have implemented the <a href="ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-seidman-clientsideimagemap-02.txt">IETF
Internet Draft</a> for client-side image maps. This is similar to server-side
ISMAP images: You are presented with an image that you can click on to
take you to a number of different sites. </li>

<p>With server-side image maps, the x,y coordinates of the click are sent
to the server, and the server decides which URL you see. With client-side
image maps, the MAP that relates parts of the image to different URLs is
stored in the current file.</p>

<p>This saves a round trip to the server, and should present documents
to you faster. Since the MAP information is stored in the document you
are viewing, the destination URLs can be displayed in the status area as
you pass the mouse over the image map.</p>

<li>Background Image: Netscape no longer waits for the background image
to completely arrive before displaying any text and images on a page. When
the background image has been decoded the page is redrawn to include the
background.</li>

<li>Custom Colormap: For those running in 256-color mode, pages with a
single GIF image should look better because a custom colormap is installed.
This is for GIF images only and not for JPEG images. To view a single GIF
image, use right mouse button to click on the image, and choose &quot;View
this Image&quot; from the pop-up menu.</li>

<li>Fast, Progressive JPEG images: Support for progressive JPEG images
gives you high quality images that load faster than regular JPEG or GIF
images. The progressive loading is smoother than the interlaced GIF loading,
so you can identify the image sooner.</li>

<li>Automatic Dithering:In previous releases, you had to decide between
&quot;Dither to Color Cube&quot; and &quot;Use Closest Color in Color Cube&quot;.
This preference was set for every image on every page.</li>

<p>Now you can specify &quot;Automatic Dithering&quot; and Netscape will
make the decision to dither or not for each image on the page. In general,
your images should look better with automatic dithering. The old options
are still there, so if you want to set them yourself, you can.</p>

<p>The default setting is &quot;Automatic Dithering&quot;.</p>

<li>FONT <font COLOR="#FF0000">C</font><font COLOR="#008000">O</font><font COLOR="#0000FF">L</font><font COLOR="#800080">O</font><font COLOR="#A52A2A">R</font>
tag: In addition to specifying font colors for text and links on a whole
page, you can use the new COLOR attribute in the FONT tag to choose colors
for just part of a page, or part of a <font COLOR="#A52A2A">W</font><font COLOR="#0000FF">O</font><font COLOR="#008000">R</font><font COLOR="#FF0000">D</font>
! The syntax for the FONT tag is as follows:</li>

<p>&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#FF0000&quot;&gt;<font COLOR="#FF0000">Red</font>&lt;/FONT&gt;

<br>&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#00FF00&quot;&gt;<font COLOR="#00FF00">Green</font>&lt;/FONT&gt;

<br>&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;#0000FF&quot;&gt;<font COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</font>&lt;/FONT&gt;

<br></p>

<p>You can also use Color Names instead color codes. For Example, the syntax
could also be: </p>

<p>&lt;FONT COLOR=&quot;Purple&quot;&gt;<font COLOR="#800080">Purple</font>&lt;/FONT&gt;
</p>

<p>This is also true with the &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=&quot;Black&quot; TEXT=&quot;White&quot;&gt;
tag.</p>

<li>DIV tag:We support a new HTML 3.0 tag that lets you</li>

<p><tt>&lt;DIV ALIGN=&quot;left&quot;&gt; 
<br></tt>Left justify text by putting it 
<br>within the DIV tags. 
<br><tt>&lt;/DIV&gt;</tt></p>

<p><tt>&lt;DIV ALIGN=&quot;center&quot;&gt; 
<br></tt>Center some text by putting it 
<br>within the DIV tags. 
<br><tt>&lt;/DIV&gt;</tt></p>

<p><tt>&lt;DIV ALIGN=&quot;right&quot;&gt; 
<br></tt>Right justify some text by putting it 
<br>within the DIV tags. 
<br><tt>&lt;/DIV&gt;</tt></p>

<li>WRAP attribute in the TEXTAREA tag: You can specify how to handle word-wrapping
in text input areas in forms.</li>

<ul>
<ul>
<dt>&lt;TEXTAREA WRAP=OFF&gt; -- the default setting</dt>

<dd>Wrapping doesn't happen. Lines are sent exactly as typed.</dd>

<dt>&lt;TEXTAREA WRAP=VIRTUAL&gt;</dt>

<dd>The display word-wraps, but long lines are sent as one line without
new-lines.</dd>

<dt>&lt;TEXTAREA WRAP=PHYSICAL&gt;</dt>

<dd>The display word-wraps, and the text is transmitted at all wrap points.</dd>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>Support for superscripts and for subscripts.</li>

<p>The &lt;SUP&gt; &lt;/SUP&gt; tags let you define <sup>super</sup>scripts.</p>

<p>The &lt;SUB&gt; &lt;/SUB&gt; tags let you define <sub>sub</sub>scripts.</p>

<li>You can Quote me on that -- A stricter HTML parser: The HTML parser
now pays close attention to quotes within HTML tags. Check your HTML source
for missing quote marks if you see pages that have missing or broken images,
or have pieces of text scattered about and overlaying other parts of the
document.</li>

<li>Netscape now conforms to GIF standards:Some GIF creation utilities
produce GIF images that do not conform to standards. Such images will display
empty outlines in place of the image. These outlines are much larger than
the actual images. The images will not be visible at all.</li>

<p>To repair these GIF images, content providers can read the offending
GIF image into a different GIF utility that conforms to the GIF89a specifications,
and save the image again.</p>

<h3>User Interfaces</h3>

<li>Rearranged Tabbed dialog panels for Preferences: The panels were rearranged
and several changes were made to accommodate new features.</li>

<li>View Menu | Document Information in an HTML page:Document Information

<h3>Access Improvements</h3>

<li>HTTP File Upload:Previously, form input was limited to input boxes
and other simple elements like checkboxes and radio buttons. Now you can
write forms that ask for files as input, as described in the <a href="ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-03.txt">IETF
Internet Draft.</a></li>

<p>A new &quot;ENCTYPE&quot; attribute on the &lt;FORM&gt; tag allows you
to write forms that take files as input. An example of such a form would
be:</p>

<ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&lt;FORM ENCTYPE=&quot;multipart/form-data&quot; ACTION=&quot;_URL_&quot;
METHOD=POST&gt; 
<br>Send this file: &lt;INPUT NAME=&quot;userfile&quot; TYPE=&quot;file&quot;&gt;

<br>&lt;INPUT TYPE=&quot;submit&quot; VALUE=&quot;Send File&quot;&gt; 
<br>&lt;/FORM&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
</ul>

<li>FTP file upload: A new menu item is activated when you are browsing
FTP directories. Choose File | Upload File... and you will get a dialog
that asks you to choose a file to upload to the FTP server. You can also
do this by dragging a file (or multiple files) from the File Manager/Explorer,
to an FTP directory listing in the Netscape Window. Note: You need to have
write permission on the server where you are uploading the file(s). </li>

<p><a name="International"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>International Support</h3>

<li>Previous releases support browsing Western European languages and Japanese.
Navigator 2.0 adds support for Central European (latin2) languages, Korean,
Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.</li>

<li>International character support:&nbsp;Although doublebyte input is
supported, inline input is not. </li>

<li>International support: The editor supports high ASCII and multibyte
(e.g., Japanese) input. To regularly create and view documents in encodings
other than Latin1, set the Options|Document Encoding menu to the appropriate
encoding, and then select Options|Save Options.</li>

<li>MIME charsets supported include: </li>

<ul>
<ul>
<p>&quot;us-ascii&quot;, &quot;iso-8859-1&quot;, &quot;x-mac-roman&quot;,
&quot;iso-8859-2&quot;, &quot;x-mac-ce&quot; 
<br>&quot;iso-2022-jp&quot;,&quot;x-sjis&quot;, &quot;x-euc-jp&quot;, 
<br>&quot;euc-kr&quot;, &quot;iso-2022-kr&quot;, 
<br>&quot;gb2312&quot;, &quot;gb_2312-80&quot; 
<br>&quot;x-euc-tw&quot;, &quot;x-cns11643-1&quot;, &quot;x-cns11643-2&quot;,
&quot;big5&quot; </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>The support of languages requires the appropriate system font is installed
on your system. </li>

<li>For Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese, the
system must also provide support for 2-byte codes and input methods. For
Windows, you will need Japanese Windows, Korean Windows or Chinese Windows.
</li>

<li>Options | General Preferences | Language &quot;Accept Language&quot;
enables the user to select a prioritized list of language/region codes
that reflect what language a user wishes to display a document in, if that
document is available in different language translations. The &quot;accept
language&quot; information is contained in the HTTP Header's HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE.
A server that provides different language versions of the same content
could thus accomodate a user's preferred language. </li>

<li>Options | Document Encoding selection can be changed when viewing Mail
and News in addition to the Web Browser window. The selected encoding will
be applied to enable viewing of documents of different encodings (e.g.
Japanese) provided the user's system supports fonts for that locale. </li>

<h4>META Tag Extension for MIME Charset Info</h4>

<li>The IETF draft on Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup Language
proposes an extension to the HTML META tag to allow MIME charset information
to be contained in the HTML document:</li>

<p>&lt;META HTTP-EQUIV=&quot;Content-Type&quot; CONTENT=&quot;text/html;
charset=ISO-2022-JP&quot;&gt; </p>

<li>This support is in Navigator 2.0 and the MIME charset values supported
includes all the charsets mentioned above in the section on &quot;Additional
Languages and MIME Charsets&quot; Supported. </li>

<h4>Document Encoding User Interface</h4>

<li>Document Encoding Defaults are now easier to change. Previous releases
provided a preference panel to globally set the default character encoding
of incoming documents.</li>

<li>Navigator 2.0 makes the default selection more accessible by moving
it to the &quot;Options | Document Encoding-&gt;&quot; menu item. </li>

<li>Document encoding defaults are no longer global, so that a user may
have multiple browser windows open in different default encodings (e.g.,
Japanese in one and French in another).</li>

<li>Users who want to regularly view documents in encodings other than
Latin1 should use the Options | Document Encoding menu item to choose the
encoding, then select Options | Save Options to make it the default setting.
For example, Japanese users will want to select Japanese (Auto-detect)
from the Document Encoding list, then choose Save Options. </li>

<li>User Defined encoding is available for encodings that we have not yet
added support. </li>

<p><a name="Proxies"></a>
<hr WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center></p>

<h3>Automatic Proxy Configuration</h3>

<li>Automatic Proxy Configuration: It is now easier to specify complicated
proxy configurations for an entire site. You can tell the Navigator to
use different proxies depending on the URL or host being contacted. It's
easier to specify a large number of hosts that should not be using a proxy.
</li>

<p>Instead of specifying only one proxy per protocol, it is possible to
allow different proxies based on URL wildcard pattern matching. You can
also have multiple proxies to provide proxy failover support if the primary
proxy becomes unavailable or unresponsive. </p>

<li>Proxy Configuration File Format: The proxy configuration is specified
in a script and stored at a particular URL on a server. Since it is stored
in a central location, the system administrator can easily update the proxy
configuration for the whole site without having to reconfigure each individual
user's Navigator. </li>

<p>The configuration file has the MIME content-type of </p>

<ul>
<ul>
<p><tt>application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig</tt></p>
</ul>

<p>and is written in JavaScript. </p>
</ul>

<li>Using the Automatic Proxy Configuration: To use the Automatic Proxy
Configuration, go to the Options Menu | Network | Proxies... panel in the
Navigator, check the Auto Proxy Configuration box and enter the URL of
the proxy configuration file on the server. </li>

<p>The manual proxy configuration panel is still available. Just check
the appropriate radio button in the Proxy Preferences panel and enter your
proxy and socks hosts. </p>

<p>As before, the default is not to use proxies. </p>

<h3 align=center><font SIZE=+2>S</font>ECURITY <font SIZE=+2>I</font>MPROVEMENTS
</h3>

<li>Technical Background:</li>

<p>Netscape Navigator uses random information to generate session encryption
keys. The random information is found through a variety of functions that
look into a user's machine for information. Previous releases of Netscape
Navigator were subject to potential vulnerabilities because the size of
random input was less than the size of the subsequent keys. This means
that instead of searching through all the 2^128 possible keys by brute
force, a potential intruder only had to search through a significantly
smaller key space by brute force.</p>

<p>Netscape Navigator 2.0 incorporates fixes to the specific portion of
our software where this potential vulnerability existed. We have significantly
increased the amount of random information from approximately 30 bits to
approximately 300 bits. Netscape has greatly expanded the techniques and
sources used to generate these amounts of random information and the fixes
have been reviewed and validated by several weeks of intensive testing
on the Internet.</p>

<li>Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security of their
transactions:</li>

<li>If the attacker has physical access to your machine, security cannot
be assured.</li>

<li>Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents can log into
your machine, little can be secure. For secure servers, any insecure connection
mechanism could be suspect. Multi-user UNIX platforms will not be as secure
as single-user machines.</li>

<ul>
<ul>
<p>Details: Some of the system specific information that is used in the
seed generation is available to any user on that system. </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed into the
seed generation algorithm. Wary users can alter their user environment
before running Netscape software. </li>

<li>If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, they can
pretty much do anything.</li>

<li>Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator. Use
a version native to the platform on which you are running. </li>

<ul>
<ul>
<p>Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation depends upon
the unpredictability of the low order bits of various clocks and timers.
The clocks of many emulators may have much less entropy than the actual
builtin clocks. </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the security of
your X server. This is also true if the X connection is not to a local
machine as all of the events and the data from the screen read may be captured
from the ethernet. </li>

<ul>
<ul>
<p>Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input then its randomness
is not useful. </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>It is better to perform some user action before connecting to a secure
site. This means you should not set your home page to a secure site or
launch your client from a command line to a secure site. </li>

<ul>
<ul>
<p>Details: While navigating through menus or typing into various form
fields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability of details of the user
actions to increase the entropy of the RNG state. </p>
</ul>
</ul>

<h3 align=center><font SIZE=+2>H</font>ELPER <font SIZE=+2>A</font>PPLICATIONS
</h3>

<p>For telnet, ftp, and for displaying audio and video, Netscape uses &quot;Helper
Applications&quot;. These applications are configured in your Preferences
window. For help configuring this window, check out our documentation:
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/index.html">Helper
Applications</a> </p>

<p>On Windows, LVIEW31.EXE (for images), MPEGPLAY.EXE (for MPEG movies),
and WHAM.EXE (for audio files) are all useful applications. One site where
these can be found is <a href="ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu">ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu</a>,
but that site is often difficult to reach. You can also try the mirror
site on <a href="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/</a>.

</h3>

<h3>Navigator problems: </h3>

<li>After setting the &quot;Maximum Message Size&quot; field, in Mail and
News Preferences | Servers, you need to quit Netscape and run it again
for the value to take effect. </li>

<li>&quot;Reply-to-Address&quot; as specified in Mail and News Preferences
| Identity, has not been implemented in this release. </li>

<li>Pressing Spacebar will unsubscribe a newsgroup from the List, in the
News Window. </li>

<li>When Printing forms, only the Form Labels appear; and not the user-input
text or the Radio buttons. </li>

<li>When you use the right mouse to view a single GIF image (in 256 color
mode), you might experience a &quot;screen flash&quot; when the custom
colormap is installed. </li>

<li>If you are running in 256-color mode and have a Windows background
(wallpaper) image present, minimizing then restoring Netscape, might cause
images and the Netscape logo to appear in strange colors. Workarounds:
open a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish), or remove the Windows
background image. </li>

<li>If you are crashing a lot running 2.0, please delete or rename your
old history file &quot;NETSCAPE.HST&quot;. </li>

<li>The Apply button in the Preference panels is grayed out and not functional.
</li>

<h3>JavaScript bugs: </h3>

<li>An IMG tag without HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes may cause JavaScript
event handlers on subsequent form elements to be ignored. Workarounds:
add HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to all IMG tags, or add an empty SCRIPT
tag after all form elements that have JavaScript event handlers. </li>

<li>The selected Index property of SELECT popups is always the number of
options, not the selected option's index. </li>

<li>The INPUT focus() and select() force focus into an input tag and select
its contents, respectively, but they don't display the usual visual cues
such as insertion caret and highlighting. </li>

<li>The window.close() method is not yet implemented. </li>

<li>Operating on a closed window may crash. </li>

<li>You can't call a function in another frame or window. </li>

<li>Double-precision floating point to string conversions are subject to
platform-dependent accuracy bugs and boundary (NaN, +/-Inf) glitches. </li>

<li>&lt;SCRIPT SRC=...&gt; is not yet implemented. </li>

<h3>Java problems with the 32bit Navigator:</h3>

<li>Java will not run using the 32bit Trumpet Winsock. If you want to use
trumpet winsock with the navigator, java must be disabled. </li>

<li>Java requires at least a 256 color video driver. If you want to use
the navigator with less than 256 colors, java must be disabled. </li>

<li>The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text it can display.
Once the window fills up, it must be cleared before new text will appear.
</li>

<li>java.lang.Math.IEEERemainder(...) returns incorrect results. </li>

<li>In order for a Date object to display the timezone (ie. PST) the TZ
environment variable must be set (for both NT and Win95). </li>

<li>The AWT File Dialog box is not implemented. An exception is thrown
if you try to create a java.awt.FileDialog object. </li>

<li>The java.util.Date object is broken. </li>

<li>The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes. </li>

<li>Applet audio sometimes doesn't work correctly on NT systems. </li>

<h3>Known bugs in International support:</h3>

<li>If the Navigator is used on a machine using Japanese Windows locale,
the text on several buttons in the Options | General Preferences | Fonts
dialog box will misdisplay. The names of the fonts may also misdisplay.
However, the font functionality is unaffected. They will display correctly
when viewing documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document
encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, and the document
you are viewing was encoded using that character set). </li>

<li>Entering multibyte characters in forms is not implemented in this release.
</li>

<li>International character support:&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
<li>Although doublebyte input is supported, inline input is not. </li>

<li>On multibyte systems, buttons in some dialog boxes will display incorrectly.
For example, if you install Navigator Gold on a machine running Japanese
Win95 or NT 3.51, the&nbsp;Cancel, Apply, and Help buttons appear as MOJIBAKE&nbsp;(garbage
characters).</li>
