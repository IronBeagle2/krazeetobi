<B>Netcaster: Integrated and Easy to Use</B></H3>
Netcaster is tightly integrated with all Communicator components, providing
seamless access from the desktop to the most up-to-date information users
need.&nbsp; Netcaster leverages the "point-and-click" ease of use pioneered
by Navigator to offer quick access to favorite channels and offline resources.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Integrated with Communicator.</B> Like all other components, simply
select from the Communicator menu to access Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Full-screen experience. </B>The Netcaster interface slides away discreetly
to provide more screen real estate, making content and information, rather
than menus and toolbars, the focus of attention. Netcaster also supports
full-screen channels for the most dynamic and immersive experience. In
addition, users can configure the Netcaster user interface to slide from
either the right or left side of the screen to accommodate individual preferences
and desktop environments.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Channels and Channel Finder.</B> Netcaster's easy-to-use interface provides
quick access to a user's favorite channels and offline sites. Netcaster
prominently features Channel Finder, the source for the most dynamic channels
on the Internet, on the user interface.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Customizable subscriptions. </B>Users can add or subscribe to a channel
and specify preferences as to cache size, the number of pages to download,
and when and how often the content should be automatically updated. With
Netcaster, users receive only the information they want.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Webtop mode. </B>Users can anchor their favorite channel in webtop mode
and have it automatically launch upon startup. Webtop mode provides ever-present
links to important data and allows users to monitor information delivered
in the background while working on day-to-day tasks and productivity applications.</LI>

<LI>
Netcaster is not bundled with Communicator and must be installed separately
from a jar file which can be obtained from the Netscape homepage.</LI>

<LI>
You must exit Communicator after installing Netcaster and then re-launch
Communicator in order to start Netcaster successfully.</LI>

<LI>
Netcaster is ready for use after "My Channels" appears in the selector.</LI>

If controls do not appear on a webtop click the tab to expose the selector
controls.</LI>

<LI>
If no dialogs appear after clicking on print, check with your system administrator
that printers have been setup correctly.</LI>

<LI>
&nbsp;Closing (as opposed to Exiting) the Communicator window from which
Netcaster was launched results in Netcaster also shutting down.&nbsp; Additional
Communicator windows can be open and closed without affecting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>After starting Netcaster, there is a significant delay before the Netcaster window appears.</LI>

<LI>It is required that you use Communicator 4.03 with this version of Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>The order of the channels in the selector may change after exiting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>The Automatically Load Images preference (Preferences, Advanced from the
Edit menu) should be checked.</LI>

<LI>
If you specify an invalid URL when adding a channel, the channel is added
under My Channels, but does not appear when you select it. A green light
may also appear; ignore this light.</LI>

<LI>
If you change a webtop to a channel in Channel Properties, the webtop remains
on your screen. Close the webtop and when you select it again in My Channels,
it appears as a channel in a Navigator window.</LI>

<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#000000">If you change your Communicator preferences, such
as color or font, while Netcaster is open, a system halt may occur. Change
your Communicator preferences before starting Netcaster.</FONT></LI>

<LI>
The buttons in the Netcaster window may disappear depending on the font
you select.</LI>

<LI>

dialog.</LI>

<LI>

<LI>
If you change your screen's resolution while Netcaster is running, the
Netcaster window may no longer be visible.</LI>

<LI>
The display and cache size of the Castanet channels cannot be modified.</LI>

<LI>
If you add a Castanet channel by specifying its IP address and then access
the channel again by specifying its DNS name, Netcaster will attempt to
resubscribe to the channel.</LI>

<LI>
Unless you specifically use the Update Now command to update a channel,
at most, one channel will update.</LI>

<LI>
Some of the channel preferences may not be visible until you restart Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
If you add two channels with the same name, an error may occur.</LI>

<LI>
You cannot move a webtop, as indicated in the Netcaster NetHelp.</LI>

<LI>

marked "Grant" does not appear in the dialog,&nbsp; exit Communicator or
Navigator and restart.</LI>

Installation Instructions</H4>
Normally Netcaster can be installed through the web, by visiting the appropriate
link off the Netscape home page. In some cases you may receive a Netcaster
jar file along with Communicator or Navigator.&nbsp; If this is the case,
follow these steps:
<OL>
<LI>
Place the Netcaster jar file in a directory of your choice. For example,
assuming nc10unb1.jar is the name of the Netcaster jar file:</LI>

<DL>
<DD>
<TT>cp nc10unb1.jar /usr/myself/install</TT></DD>
</DL>

<LI>
Launch Communicator or Navigator and visit the installation directory url
at:</LI>

<DD>
<TT>file:/usr/myself/install</TT></DD>

<LI>
Click the link to <TT>nc10unb1.jar</TT> which appears in the browser window.</LI>

<LI>
Several dialog boxes appear that lead you through the installation process.</LI>

<LI>
When installation is complete you must exit Communicator/Navigator and
restart the program before using Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
The Netcaster menu item should now be available. You can now run Netcaster
by selecting it.</LI>

<LI>
After installation, the jar file and the install directory are no longer
needed and can be deleted or archived in case you want to reinstall in
the future.</LI>
</OL>
