<LI>Using templates:&nbsp;if you are upgrading from a previous installation of Gold, you will need to update your <B>New document from template</B> preference in the General panel of the Editor Preferences dialog box. Choose Options|Editor Preferences and then select the General tab. Click on the Restore Default button in the New document template section. This will update the location to the 3.0 version location.</LI>

<LI>Inserting targets (named anchors): when you use the Link properties dialog to create a link to a target, click the Apply button (instead of OK) to ensure that the link is successfully created.</LI>

<LI>Cursor placement in table cells: sometimes it is difficult to place the cursor into tall, narrow, empty table cells. If this happens, you should be able to successfully place the cursor by clicking near the bottom edge of the empty cell. Alternatively, place the cursor in the table cell to the left of the cell you want and use the right arrow key to move the cursor into the desired cell. </LI>

<LI>FTP&nbsp;publishing: don't use the tilde (~) character in filenames or to indicate relative path names. Use<B> /./</B> instead. For example, instead of <B>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/~lloyd/public_html, </B>use <B>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/./public_html.</B></LI>

<LI>Invalid URL characters in passwords: using certain characters (such as &gt;,&lt;, \, #, &quot;, },{, `) will cause errors when publishing. Also, some passwords cause problems when there is an FTP proxy defined (specified in the Proxies panel of the Network Preferences dialog). Workaround: don't enter your password in the Publish dialog. Enter the password when you are prompted for it.</LI>

<LI>Invalid characters in URLs: avoid using these characters in URLs: tab, space, &quot;, &lt;. &gt;, [, \, ], ^, ', {, |,}, ~.</LI>

<LI>Invalid characters for filenames: certain characters have special meaning when used in URLs and therefore should not be used in filenames: #, %, &amp;, /, : (colon), ; (semi-colon), ?, @, =.</LI>

<LI>Truncated images: if you are low on disk space and try to insert an image, it will be truncated or its size set to 0.</LI>

<LI>Undo does not function correctly after inserting a named anchor (target).</LI>

<LI>Editing a remote page that contains multiple animated .GIF files or form elements may cause the application to crash if you select Cancel at the Save dialog box.</LI>

<LI>Images:</LI>

<UL type=circle>

<LI>Inserting images: When you click the <B>Original Size </B>button in the Image Properties dialog box, the dimensions display as 0 (zero). This is temporary and does not affect the original size of the image. Click OK or Apply to exit the dialog box. Select the image you inserted and then display the Image Properties dialog box again to view the correct dimensions.</LI>

<LI>Changes made by resizing an image through an external image editor aren't automatically reflected in the editor. Use the Image Properties dialog box to adjust the dimensions as well. Click on the Restore&nbsp;Default button and click OK to set dimensions to the new size.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>If you have Plug-ins on your regular installation of the Netscape Navigator, you must repeat the installation procedure for Navigator Gold (unless you install Navigator Gold in the same directory)</LI>

<LI>If you edit a document that has invalid HTML, it may appear differently in the browser than in the editor.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>International support: multibyte input now supported (Japanese, Korean, Chinese).</LI>
<LI>Table alignment: tables can now be aligned to the left, right, or centered in your document. Use the Table alignment options in the New Table Properties dialog box . Don't use the text alignment buttons on the toolbar for table alignment.</LI>
<LI>Table display: If you plan to create large tables with many columns and rows, consider displaying them <I>flat </I>to save time and your computer's memory. You can still edit individual cells and modify their properties,and when you browse your document the tables display normally. Select <B>View|Display
Tables</B> to display tables normally (when the item is checked it's selected). Otherwise, the editor displays the table as one long series of cells in successive order; borders and colors are not displayed.</LI>
<LI>Auto Save: Set the amount of time you want the editor to automatically save your document. Select the General panel from the Options|Editor Preferences dialog box.</LI>
<LI>Underline text style is now available in the Character panel of the Text Properties dialog box.</LI>
<LI>Online help is available for all editor-specific dialog boxes.</LI>
<LI>Tables feature: Select <B>Table</B> from the Insert menu and use the Create Table dialog box to specify the number of columns and rows, and other attributes for the table, such as height, width, cell color, and caption placement.</LI>
</UL>

<UL type=disc>

<UL type=disc>

<LI>Once you've created the table, you can add additional rows, columns, and cells by using the <B>Row</B>, <B>Column</B>, and <B>Cell </B>items on the Insert menu.</LI>
<LI>Use the <B>Table, Row, </B>and <B>Cell </B>items on the Properties menu to change the attributes for the currently selected table, row, or cell.</LI>

</UL>



<LI>FTP URLs can now specify a relative path instead of specifying a path

from the root directory. This is especially useful when specifying an upload

directory. For example, suppose you have a directory called <B>public_html</B>

in which you store your html files. Normally using the browser, you would

have to specify the absolute path <B>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/public/lloyd/public_html</B>.

Instead, you can specify a relative path with <B>ftp://lloyd@foo.isv.com/./public_html</B>.

The<B> /./</B> replaces <B>/public/lloyd/</B> in the URL. This is important

because over time, your absolute path may change, but the relative path

will always remain the same.</LI>



<LI>Shortcut keys:</LI>



<UL type=disc>

<LI>To enter one or more non-breaking spaces, press Shift+Spacebar.</LI>



<LI>To enter a line break, press Shift+Enter.</LI>

<H3>General Features</H3>



<UL>

<LI><B>New Directory buttons:</B> The directory button toolbar now includes

Destinations and People. Net Directory and Handbook have been removed.</LI>



<LI><B>New Directory menu items:</B> The Directory menu now has items for

Netscape Destinations and People. Internet Directory and Internet White

Pages have been removed.</LI>



<LI><B>New Navigation for Frames and the Back button:</B> Now, when you

click on a link that updates a frame, pressing the <B>Back</B> button returns

you to the previous state of the frame. Previously, pressing the <B>Back</B>

button ignored updates within a page's frames and always returned you to

the previous whole page (further back than you probably wanted). In short,

navigating among frames now works on a per frame basis: pressing <B>Back</B>

revisits the previous frame and pressing <B>Forward</B> revisits the frame

ahead.</LI>



<LI><B>Three-pane configurability:</B> A pane layout option has been added

to the <B>Mail and News|Appearance</B> panel (choose the <B>Options|Mail

and News Preferences|Appearance</B> menu item). The panel offers radio

buttons to designate the layout of the three panes in the Mail and News

windows. Choose <B>Split Horizontal</B> (<B>Articles on top</B> on Macintosh)

to align the message content pane to the right of the two split panes.

Choose <B>Split Vertical</B> (<B>Articles on left</B> on Macintosh) to

align the message content pane below the two split panes. Choose <B>Stack</B>

(<B>Stacked</B> on Macintosh) to align the message content pane below the

two stacked panes (layered in rows atop one another).</LI>



<LI><B>Show recipient in Sent Folder and Outbox:</B> When you select a

mail folder by clicking on it, the message heading pane displays the titles

of messages contained in that folder. In previous versions, you'd always

see the title <B>Sender</B> above a column that shows the name of the sender

of the mail message. Now, in the Outbox and Sent Mail folders, you'll see

the title <B>Recipient</B> instead of Sender, and the column shows the

email address of the mail recipient. For sent mail, the recipient info

is much more useful than the sender info (typically yourself).</LI>



<LI><B>Compressed headers:</B> When viewing either the Mail or News window,

the <B>Options</B> menu now offers a cascading (hierarchical) menu items

called <B>Show Headers</B> that replaces the <B>Show All Headers</B> item.

The new menu item gives you more options to control the number of header

information fields displayed when viewing messages. <B>All</B> displays

all possible header fields. <B>Normal</B> displays the primary address

fields. <B>Brief</B> displays only subject and recipient fields.</LI>



<LI><B>Netscape Navigator Gold:</B> Netscape Navigator Gold has been updated

for Win32 and Mac. Gold now lets you edit tables.</LI>



<LI><B>New Network preferences panels:</B> New Network|Protocols and Network|Languages

preference panels to expand and improve user preferences for security and

privacy control.</LI>



<LI><B>POP3 servers:</B> The <B>Keep Mail on Server</B> and <B>Maximum

Message Size</B> options now work even with POP3 servers that do not implement

the UIDL command.</LI>



<LI><B>Special characters:</B> Additional entity names such as &quot;&amp;pound&quot;

are now implemented.</LI>

<H3>Layout Features</H3>



<UL>

<LI><B>Frame Border Control:</B> You can use the FRAMEBORDER, BORDER, and

BORDERCOLOR attributes to control the display type, width, and color of

frame borders. For precise control of border appearance, use all three

attributes.</LI>



<P>The FRAMEBORDER attribute determines how frame borders are displayed

(outline-3D or plain). The attribute can be set with the value FRAMEBORDER=YES

(outline-3D border) or FRAMEBORDER=NO (plain border), and can be used in

the &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag or the &lt;FRAME&gt; tag. The default is FRAMEBORDER=YES.

When used in the &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag, the FRAMEBORDER attribute sets the

default value for all frames in the frameset. When used in the &lt;FRAME&gt;

tag, the attribute applies only to the particular frame, overriding any

frameset attribute. Because borders are shared between frames, a border

will be plain only if all adjacent frames have their attribute set FRAMEBORDER=NO.</P>



<P>The BORDER attribute determines the thickness of frame borders for all

frames in a frameset tag. The attribute can be set with a value from 0

to N, and can only be used on the outermost &lt;FRAMESET&gt; (not on a

per-frame basis). For example, setting BORDER=0 positions adjacent frames

with no border space between them, BORDER=3 positions adjacent frames with

3 pixels of border space between them, and so on. The default is BORDER=5.</P>



<P>Remember, when neither a FRAMEBORDER or BORDER attribute is specified,

the default is an outline-3D frame with a width of 5. Setting FRAMEBORDER=NO

without a BORDER attribute displays a plain border with a width of 5. Unless

you explicitly specify BORDER=0, a frame border is displayed.</P>



<P>Note also that when FRAMEBORDER=YES and BORDER is used, the thicker,

outline borders acquire a 3-D appearance.</P>



<P>The BORDERCOLOR attribute determines the color of frame borders. The

attribute can be set with a color name or RGB value, and can be used in

the &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag or the &lt;FRAME&gt; tag. When used in the &lt;FRAME&gt;

tag, the attribute attempts to set the colors of the frame's borders. When

used in the &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag, the attribute attempts to set the colors

of all borders of all frames in the frameset.</P>



<P>Because frame borders are shared, border color conflicts are resolved

as follows: The attribute appearing in the outer &lt;FRAMESET&gt; has the

lowest priority. This is, in turn, overridden by the attribute used in

a nested &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag. Finally, the BORDERCOLOR attribute used

in a &lt;FRAME&gt; tag overrides all previous &lt;FRAMESET&gt; tag uses.

If there is a conflict for two colors of equal priority both set on the

same edge, the behavior is undefined.</P>



<LI><B>Multi-Column Text:</B> The &lt;MULTICOL&gt; tag is a container,

and all the HTML between the starting and ending tag will be displayed

in a multi-column format. The tag can be nested, although multi-column

text within multi-column text becomes quickly unreadable. The attributes

of this tag are COLS, GUTTER, and WIDTH.</LI>



<P>The COLS attribute is mandatory and controls how many columns the display

will be split into. Layout will attempt to flow elements evenly across

the columns to make each column have about the same height. Unless the

WIDTH attribute is specified, column with is adjusted to fill the available

view.</P>



<P>The GUTTER attribute controls the pixels of space between columns. It

defaults to a value of <TT>10</TT>.</P>



<P>The WIDTH attribute controls the width of an individual column. All

columns are always the same width, so the overall width of a multi-column

layout is:<BR>

<TT>(cols * width) + ((cols - 1) * gutter)</TT><BR>

</P>



<LI><B>Horizontal and Vertical Spacing:</B> A new tag called &lt;SPACER&gt;

provides better control over the spacing of objects and whitespace in HTML

pages. The attributes to spacer are TYPE, SIZE, WIDTH, HEIGHT, and ALIGN.</LI>



<P>The TYPE attribute has three possible values: horizontal, vertical,

and block. These correspond to the three types of spacing control delineated

above. The default value is horizontal.</P>



<UL>

<LI>The horizontal spacer inserts horizontal space between words. The width

of the space is controlled by the SIZE attribute.</LI>



<LI>The vertical spacer inserts vertical space between lines. Implicit

in this spacer is a line break to end the current line, then the vertical

space is added before the beginning of the next line. The height of the

space is controlled by the SIZE attribute.</LI>



<LI>The block spacer behaves almost exactly like an invisible image. When

using this type of spacer the SIZE attribute is ignored, and instead the

WIDTH, HEIGHT, and ALIGN attributes are applied just as they would be for

the &lt;IMG&gt; tag.</LI>

</UL>



<P>The SIZE attribute only applies when the spacer has a type of horizontal

or vertical. Then this attribute controls the absolute width or height

in pixels of the spacing added.</P>



<P>The WIDTH attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block. Then

this attribute controls the absolute width in pixels of the spacing rectangle

added.</P>



<P>The HEIGHT attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block.

Then this attribute controls the absolute height in pixels of the spacing

rectangle added.</P>



<P>The ALIGN attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block. Then

this attribute controls the alignment of the spacing rectangle in exactly

the same way it would control the alignment of an &lt;IMG&gt; tag.</P>



<LI><B>Strikeout and Underline Text:</B> Netscape has always supported

strikeout text in the form of the &lt;STRIKE&gt; tag. Now Netscape also

supports an alternative syntax, the &lt;S&gt; tag, while maintaining support

for the &lt;STRIKE&gt; tag as backwards compatibility.</LI>



<P>Netscape now supports underlined text using the &lt;U&gt; tag. The tag

causes all text between the start and end tag to have a solid underline

drawn along the common baseline of the text.</P>



<LI><B>JavaScript Evaluation in HTML:</B> JavaScript evaluation in HTML

attribute values allows JavaScript to be dynamically evaluated in the right-hand

side of an HTML attribute name/value pair (that is, when calculating the

values of HTML attributes). This allows the attributes of one HTML element

to depend on information about previously placed elements on the page.</LI>



<P>JavaScript evaluation uses the HTML entity sequence as follows:</P>



<P><TT>&amp;lt; == &quot;&lt;&quot;</TT></P>



<P>Where &quot;&amp;&quot; denotes the start of an entity, and &quot;;&quot;

terminates it. In this case a dynamic entity is in the form of a JavaScript

expression enclosed in curly braces:</P>



<P><TT>&amp;{<I>javascript_expression</I>}; == &quot;<I>returned_string</I>&quot;</TT></P>



<P>JavaScript entities concatenate with the surrounding text:</P>



<P><TT>&quot;&amp;{10 * 10};%&quot; == &quot;100%&quot;</TT></P>



<P>JavaScript entities can only be interpreted on the right-hand side of

HTML attribute name/value pairs.</P>



<LI><B>FONT FACE=fontName:</B> The FONT FACE attribute lets you specify

the names of specific fonts as your preferred font choices in the format:</LI>



<P><TT>&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;font1,font2,fontN&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;</TT></P>



<P>For example, if font1 is not available, font2 is used. If no specified

font is available, the default font is used. COLOR and SIZE attributes

can be specified along with the FACE attribute.</P>



<P><TT>&lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Garamond,Helvetica,Times&quot;&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;</TT></P>



<LI><B>Support table cell background colors:</B> You can specify a background

color to be used when displaying table cells. To specify a table background

color use the <B>bgcolor</B> attribute. Nested tables inherit background

colors.</LI>



<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 WIDTH="20%" >

<P>The <B>bgcolor</B> tag specifies one of the supported color names and

can be used with the following tags: <B>table</B>, <B>td</B>, <B>th</B>,

<P>Here's the HTML that produced the table on the right.<BR clear=all>

<P><A NAME="Message"></A></P>



<H3>Message Composition and Viewing Improvements</H3>



<UL>

<LI><B>Long-line Wrapping in Message Composition window:</B> The new Message

Composition window menu item <B>View|Wrap Long Lines</B>, when checked,

automatically line-wraps the messages you send such that no line is longer

than 72 characters. The width of the Message Composition window does not

affect line-wrapping, nor are the line breaks you see necessarily the wrapping

that is sent. When unchecked, messages are sent without automatic line-wrapping

and the line breaks that you see are sent. The default is checked.</LI>



<P>In previous versions, long lines were wrapped at the width of the window.

This gave a &quot;What You See Is What You Get&quot; aspect to the message

composition window. Regardless of whether the sender had allowed text to

auto-wrap, or had hit return at the end of every line, or had resized the

window, the recipient of the message would see the same line breaks as

the sender.</P>



<P>However, problems occurred when senders made their composition windows

very wide for ease of editing. It was very easy to accidentally send out

messages with long lines that exceeded the 80 column limit. To many recipients,

such messages would be very difficult to read.</P>



<P>In this version, outgoing text is wrapped at 72 columns, regardless

of the size of the window. This makes the composition window less WYSIWYG,

but it does make it much harder to accidentally generate unreadable messages.</P>



<P>There is (and has been) a single exception to the line wrapping rule:

Lines which have the character <B><TT>&gt;</TT></B> as their first character

are never wrapped. Such lines are usually a part of quoted text and it

is important to preserve the special character at the start of each line.</P>



<P>It is also still true that lines beginning with <B><TT>&gt;</TT></B>

will appear to be wrapped in the Message Composition window if the lines

are longer than the window is wide. This is a property of the platform-provided

text editors. At the time the message is sent, these lines will be effectively

unwrapped.</P>



<P>Since the column at which word-wrapping occurs is no longer tied to

the size of the window, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option has been added

to turn off word-wrapping on the Message Composition window. This is for

the less common case where you need to send a message with specially-formatted

text such as wide tables or charts, or data where wrapping the lines would

damage the data.</P>



<P>When this option is selected, two things happen: First, the text area

no longer does word-wrapping (a horizontal scrollbar will be presented

instead). Second, the generated message will have exactly the line breaks

that the user inserted explicitly and no automatic wrapping of any kind

will occur.</P>



<P>The default for the option is to wrap lines and the option is not persistent.

If you turn wrapping off, the particular composition window is affected

only this one time (since no-wrapping is an unusual case).</P>



<LI><B>Long-line Wrapping in Mail and News windows:</B> The new menu item

in the Mail and News windows <B>View|Wrap Long Lines</B>, when checked,

displays long lines in the message in shorter, more numerous lines. When

unchecked, long lines are more likely to extend off the screen and require

the horizontal scroll bar for viewing. The default is unchecked.</LI>



<P>Messages marked as <TT>text/plain</TT> should have preformatted line

breaks so that the text does not require reformatting or wrapping. However,

two forms of messages cause problems:</P>



<P>First, there are the messages which have line breaks at the end of each

line, but which have lines which are too long (say, 100 character lines

rather than 79 character lines.) Such messages were easy to generate with

earlier versions of Netscape by simply making the Message Composition window

wider than its default size.</P>



<P>Second, there are the messages which only have line breaks at the end

of each paragraph. These messages are generated by software which does

not understand the requirements of Internet mail and inappropriately assumes

that the recipient of the message will always be able to rewrap the messages.</P>



<P>To address both types of message, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option

has been added to the <B>View</B> menu on both the Mail and News windows.

This allows lines which are longer than the width of the window to be wrapped.

Turning this option on will probably make correctly-formatted messages

look worse, however, for messages which are incorrectly formatted with

overly long lines, the option makes the messages readable.</P>



<P>Note that though there are now line-wrapping options on both the Message

Composition window, and on the Mail and News windows, they do very different

things. The former affects the actual text that will be mailed out; the

latter merely controls the presentation of received messages without actually

altering them.</P>

</UL>



<P><A NAME="MIME"></A></P>



<H3>MIME Parser Improvements</H3>



<P>The MIME message display engine has been significantly improved. A number

of new features have been added and a number of bugs have been fixed.</P>



<UL>

<LI><B>When saving attachments, a more reasonable default file name will

be used:</B> In earlier versions, the <B>Save This Link As</B> command

(and its shortcut, the shift-click or option-click gesture) did not generally

offer a good default file name when prompting for the place to save the

attachment. This is now fixed: the suggested file name should always be

the original name of the attached document.</LI>



<LI><B>Support for uuencoded data in non-MIME messages is greatly improved:</B>

In previous versions of Netscape, uuencoded pseudo-attachments were not

handled as well as full-fledged MIME attachments; the handling of uuencoded

data in non-MIME messages should now be virtually indistinguishable from

real MIME attachments, from the end user's point of view.</LI>



<P>In previous versions, uuencoded data was automatically decoded only

if it appeared to be on of the built-in image types (GIF, JPEG, and XBM);

and once the uuencoded data was encountered, it was considered to extend

from the <TT>begin</TT> line to the end of the message. This has been fixed:</P>



<UL>

<LI>Any number of uuencoded segments in a message will be displayed as

attachments: the uuencoded data is considered to extend from the <TT>begin</TT>

to the <TT>end</TT> line, and then the remainder of the message will be

presented in the usual way.</LI>



<LI>Any type of uuencoded data will be treated as an attachment, not just

images. If the extension on the name of the attached file is one that indicates

that it is a GIF, JPEG, or XBM, then the attachment will be decoded and

displayed inline; otherwise, it will be presented as a normal attachment

link, making it easy to decode and save the data to a file.</LI>



<LI>The <B>View Attachments as Links</B> menu item now affects the presentation

of uuencoded attachments in the same way it has always affected MIME attachments.</LI>



<LI>When uuencoded attachments are saved, they will always be decoded first,

just as base64-encoded data is.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>BinHex data is recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> In much the

same way that we notice the presence of uuencoded data in non-MIME messages,

we now also notice BinHex data.</LI>



<LI><B>Sun MailTool attachments are supported:</B> Attachments of the form

generated by Sun's MailTool (messages of type <TT>x-sun-attachment</TT>)

are recognized, and displayed just like normal MIME messages.</LI>



<LI><B>The multipart/alternative MIME type is supported:</B> The <TT>multipart/alternative</TT>

Content-Type is a container that includes different versions of the same

document; for example, a <TT>text/plain</TT> version, followed by a <TT>text/html</TT>

version, followed by an <TT>application/postscript</TT> version. Netscape

will present to the user only one of the versions, the highest ``resolution''

version that can be displayed inline.</LI>



<P>Netscape does not currently have the ability to generate messages which

contain <TT>multipart/alternative</TT> data, but it is now capable of displaying

it (for compatibility with existing and future mailers which do generate

such messages.)</P>



<LI><B>The message/external-body MIME type is supported:</B> The <TT>message/external-body</TT>

Content-Type is a MIME representation of what is essentially a URL: it

describes a method for retrieving a document from the net. The directly-supported

<TT>message/external-body</TT> access methods are <TT>ftp</TT>, <TT>anon-ftp</TT>,

<TT>local-file</TT>, <TT>afs</TT>, <TT>mail-server</TT>, and <TT>url</TT>.</LI>



<LI><B>Uuencoded data is only recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> We no

longer recognize uuencoded data in arbitrary parts of type <TT>text/plain</TT>:

we now only do this auto-<WBR>recognition in messages which have no Content-Type

specified. That is, if the message is a full-fledged MIME message, we always

believe the Content-Type of that message. If it says it's plain text, then

we treat it as plain text and don't play guessing games behind its back.</LI>



<P>However, if the message does not have a Content-Type, then it is not

a MIME message, and we assume that it may contain either text, or uuencoded

data, or BinHex data, or any combination thereof.</P>



<P>So if you come across a message that contains uuencoded data, and we

did not present it as an attachment, then that's probably because that

message was generated by simply pasting the uuencoded data into the main

body of the message with a MIME-compliant mailer.</P>



<P>The proper way to send uuencoded data with a MIME-compliant mailer is

to attach the uuencoded file to the message, so that it shows up as a MIME

part, with some non-text Content-Type, and <TT>x-uuencode</TT> as its Content-Transfer-Encoding.</P>

<LI><B>Java, JavaScript, and Plug-in Connectivity:</B> Netscape's LiveConnect

lets you integrate Java, JavaScript and Navigator plug-ins. This allows

you to create plug-ins and applets that can be controlled by Java and JavaScript,

or use Java and JavaScript to implement portions of your plug-in. Fundamentally,

LiveConnect allows you to call:</LI>

<H3>JavaScript</H3>



<UL>

<LI><B>JavaScript-generated documents:</B> JavaScript-generated documents

can be printed, saved as files, and viewed with View Document/Frame Source.</LI>



<LI><B>Resizing a JavaScript-generated document modifies location field:</B>

When you resize a Javascript-generated document, the following text appears

in the location field as a prefix to the URL:</LI>



<P><TT>wysiwyg://(id)/</TT></P>



<P>where <TT>(id)</TT> after the literal 'wysiwyg://' and before the third

'/' is automatically generated.</P>



<LI><B>Resizing a window reloads its documents from cache:</B> Previously,

resizing caused JavaScript to rerun the same scripts as when the page first

loaded. Now, the document is reloaded from cache (scripts are not rerun,

the load and unload events are not sent, and user-defined variables and

properties are not reinitialized). There is currently one exception: Resizing

can cause HTML objects such as forms and links to lose their user-set properties

(the objects are reflected again by the reload).</LI>



<LI><B>NOSCRIPT tag:</B> A <TT>&lt;NOSCRIPT&gt;...&lt;/NOSCRIPT&gt;</TT>

tag has been added so that if a user has JavaScript turned off in the Network|Languages

preferences panel or if a user's browser application does not support JavaScript,

the user sees the HTML between the noscript tag and its end tag.</LI>



<LI><B>SRC attribute:</B> The <TT>&lt;SCRIPT&gt;</TT> tag now has an additional

attribute that allows a JavaScript file to be specified as the JavaScript

source (rather than embedding the JavaScript in the HTML). Attributes within

the SCRIPT tag can now be specified as follows:</LI>



<P><TT>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript SRC=mySource.js&gt;</TT></P>



<P>where <TT>mySource.js</TT> is the URL (relative or full address) of

the JavaScript source code file.</P>



<P>The LANGUAGE attribute is mandatory unless the SRC attribute is present

and specifies the scripting language. The SRC attribute is optional and,

if given, specifies a URL that loads the text of a script. Both attributes

may be present.</P>



<P>The SRC attribute specifies the scripting language by using the .js

suffix. The suffix must be mapped by the web server to the MIME type &quot;application/x-javascript&quot;

which the server sends back in the HTTP GET reply's Content-type: header.

Without a properly configured server (one that maps .js filename suffix

to application/x-javascript MIME), Netscape won't respond properly with

the data coming back in the HTTP response to the SRC-initiated request.</P>



<LI><B>Data tainting security model:</B> You can set NS_ENABLE_TAINT to

enable JavaScript in one window to see properties of a second window, regardless

of which server provided the second window's document. When JavaScript

in the first window attempts to send to a server (other than the one that

originated the data) data derived from the second window's tainted properties,

a confirming dialog is brought up so that the user can cancel or confirm

the transaction.</LI>



<P>To set NS_ENABLE_TAINT:</P>



<UL>

<LI>On UNIX, use setenv.</LI>



<LI>On Windows, use set.</LI>



<LI>On Macintosh, edit the resource with type 'Envi' and number 128 in

the Netscape application by removing the two ascii slashes &quot;//&quot;

before the NS_ENABLE_TAINT text at the end of the resource.</LI>

</UL>



<P>You can use two new functions, taint() and untaint(), to mark and unmark

an argument datum with taint associated with the current script. For example,

to remove taint from a form input element so that it can be sent to another

server by the server's script, you would say:</P>



<P><TT>untainted = untaint(document.form1.input3)<BR>

// now untainted can be sent in a URL or form post by other scripts</TT></P>



<P>Neither taint() nor untaint() modifies its single argument. Rather,

both functions return a marked or unmarked reference to the argument object,

or a copy of the primitive type value (number or boolean value).</P>



<LI><B>JavaScript reflection of plug-ins:</B> Allows developers to dynamically

determine what plug-ins are installed on the client. By making the list

of installed plug-ins accessible through JavaScript, content developers

can write simple scripts to display embedded plug-in data if the appropriate

plug-in is installed, or display some alternative information (image, text,

etc.) if not.</LI>



<P>JavaScript currently has a global &quot;navigator&quot; object which

contains properties for information not associated with any particular

document. This object now has two additional properties: a &quot;mimeTypes&quot;

object and a &quot;plugins&quot; object.</P>



<P>The mimeTypes object is an array of all MIME types supported by the

client (either internally, via helper apps, or by plug-ins). Each element

of the array is a mimeType object, which has properties for its type, description,

and file extensions.</P>



<P>The plugins object is an array of all plug-ins currently installed on

the client. Each element of the array is a plugin object, which has properties

for its name and description, as well as a subarray of mimetype objects

for the types supported by that plugin.</P>

1.0.2 of the JDK from Sun.</LI>



<LI><B>Unicode Support: </B>Java applets will now display all Unicode characters

which can be rendered with an existing system font. Support is no longer

limited to the Latin-1 subset of Unicode: Support is provided for Western

<H3>Information about the Quicktime Plug-in </H3>



<P>This part describes what you will need and how to use the Windows version

of Apple's QuickTime plug-ins for Netscape Navigator 3.0.</P>



<H4>What the QuickTime plug-in does:</H4>



<P>Apple's QuickTime plug-in for Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later lets you

experience QuickTime content directly in the Navigator browser window.

You no longer need a &quot;helper application&quot; like MoviePlayer to

view QuickTime content with Navigator 3.0. You can also view QuickTime

VR Panoramas and Objects inline, after downloading the QuickTime VR component

from Apple. As a web developer, you can control the QuickTime playback

experience through HTML commands. You can choose to have a movie automatically

played for a user, or present a controller giving users the ability to

play, stop, fastforward, and rewind.</P>



<P>The QuickTime plug-in works with existing QuickTime movies, and with

movies prepared to take advantage of the plug-in's &quot;fast start&quot;

feature. The &quot;fast start&quot; feature will present the first frame

of the movie almost immediately and can begin playing even before the movie

has been completely downloaded. The &quot;fast start&quot; feature saves

you time waiting for the entire movie to download, but otherwise plays

just like regular QuickTime movie.</P>



<P>Netscape Navigator will use the QuickTime plug-in automatically to play

any QuickTime movie while browsing the internet. The plug-in can play many

kinds of QuickTime movies (.mov files) including movies with text, MIDI,

and other kinds of data. If you have downloaded and installed the QuickTime

VR component, it will also let you interact with QuickTime VR Panoramas

and Objects.</P>



<P>WHAT YOU NEED:</P>



<UL>

<LI>A PC running Windows 95, NT, or 3.1.</LI>



<LI>Latest version(s) of QuickTime : - QuickTime 2.1.1 for Windows</LI>

</UL>



<P>You can download version of QuickTime from http://quicktime.apple.com/qt/sw/sw.html

Follow the instructions on the page to install the software. The PC files

are in ZIP format and you will need a utility such as pkunzip to extract

the software.</P>



<P>Apple's QuickTime plug-in You can obtain the QuickTime plug-in by downloading

Netscape Navigator 3.0 (http://home.netscape.com). Please make sure you

have downloaded the plug-in that is most appropriate for the computer you

are using.</P>



<P>QuickTime VR If you would like to view QuickTime VR (Virtual Reality)

Panoramas and Objects using the QuickTime plug-in, you will need the QTVR

library for Windows (QTVRW.QTC). The QTVR software is *not* included with

Netscape Navigator 3.0, but you can download them from either the Apple

QuickTime VR site (http://qtvr.quicktime.apple.com) or the QuickTime Software

page (http://quicktime.apple.com).</P>



<P>On Windows, the QTVRW.QTC file must be in the WINDOWS directory of your

primary drive.</P>



<P>If you have never seen QuickTime VR before, be sure to stop by Apple's

QuickTime VR web page (http://qtvr.quicktime.apple.com) to learn more about

this cool software.</P>



<P>Netscape Navigator 3.0 or later You can download Navigator 3.0 from

Netscape's site at http://home.netscape.com</P>



<P>HOW TO USE THE PLUG-IN:</P>



<P>Netscape Navigator 3.0 includes the QuickTime plug-in. When you run

Navigator 3.0, the plug-in will be ready to use.</P>



<P>If you are downloading the QuickTime plug-in or the QuickTime VR components

for the plug-in from Apple's web site, you must quit Netscape Navigator

and move the software to the appropriate location (see above). When you

relaunch Navigator, the plug-in will be loaded and ready to use.</P>

<P>FREQUENT QUESTIONS:</P>



<P>Q: Should Windows users download the 16-bit or 32-bit version of the

QuickTime plug-in, or both? </P>



<P>A: First of all, if you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0, you do not

need to download the plug-in, it is bundled with Navigator 3.0. But beyond

that, definitely *not* both. Download the version of the plug-in that matches

the version of Navigator you are running. If you are not sure which version

you are running, look inside the PLUGINS folder in your NETSCAPE folder.

If you see Npnull16.dll, you are using 16-bit Navigator. If you see Npnull32.dll,

you are using 32-bit Navigator.</P>



<P>Q: I am running Windows '95 (or NT). I downloaded the QuickTime VR software

(QTVRW.QTC), installed it in my WINDOWS directory, and rebooted. But When

I run Navigator with the QuickTime VR component, I can't view QuickTime

VR Panoramas and Objects. </P>



<P>A: Currently there is only a 16-bit version of the QuickTime VR software

for Windows. The 16-bit version will not work with a 32-bit (Windows '95/NT)

version of Netscape Navigator. If you would like to use the QuickTime VR

software with Navigator, you will have to download and use the Windows

3.1 version of Netscape Navigator. To get a 32-bit version of the QuickTime

VR component is available for Windows '95/NT users, download it from the

QuickTime web site (<A HREF="http://quicktime.apple.com/sw/downp.html">http://quicktime.apple.com/sw/downp.html</A>).</P>



<P>Q: I downloaded Netscape Navigator 3.0, but the QuickTime plug-in doesn't

seem to be working. </P>



<P>A: Navigator 3.0 lets you pick plug-ins for different types of content,

just like you pick helper apps. You may need to pick the QuickTime plug-in

in the Navigator &quot;Options/Helpers&quot; dialog to make the QuickTime

plug-in work.</P>



<P>Q: I am using a Web browser other than Netscape Navigator 3.0 and I

am experiencing problems with the QuickTime plug-in. </P>



<P>A: Currently, the QuickTime plug-in only supports Netscape Navigator

3.0 or later.</P>



<P>Q. I design web pages and would like to know more about movie controls

and other capabilities of the QuickTime plug-in. Where should I look for

documentation? </P>



<P>A: The QuickTime plug-in provides a number of new and exciting options

for internet content providers. Please check the documentation at http://quicktime.apple.com

to learn more.</P>



<P>Q: I am browsing a page with a QuickTime VR panorama and expect that

I can use the option and control (shift and control on Windows) to zoom

in/zoom out of the movie. Likewise, with a regular QuickTime movie, I expect

the arrow keys to step through the movie a frame at a time. But the movies

don't seem to respond to keystrokes. </P>



<P>A: You need to select the QuickTime VR panaroma or QuickTime movie first

by clicking on it. On Windows, the arrow keys do not work.</P>



<P>Q. I'd like to save some of the movies to my hard drive. How do I do

this? </P>



<P>A. You can click on the movie and press Command-S on the Macintosh or

Control-S on the PC to bring up a &quot;save&quot; dialogue. However, this

will not work for QuickTime VR movies. To save QuickTime VR movies go to

the Navigator 3.0 menu, select Options/General Preferences/Helpers, then

select QuickTime from the list and choose Edit. At this point, you'll be

presented with a few options, all will work for saving QuickTime VR files.</P>

<LI><B>Quicktime Plug-In:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>You must install Quicktime for Windows first, before viewing any Quicktime

Movies in Netscape Navigator.</LI>



<LI>You can download Quicktime for Windows from: <A HREF="http://quicktime.apple.com/qt/sw/sw.html">http://quicktime.apple.com/qt/sw/sw.html</A></LI>



<LI>For more instructions on Quicktime, check the README.TXT.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>CoolTalk:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>If you had previously installed the CoolTalk Watchdog, you need to

uninstall it by un-installing Netscape Navigator, and then reboot your

machine before installing the latest version of the Navigator. In WindowsNT

and Windows3.x, you can also do that by removing the Cooltalk Watchdog

Icon from the Startup Program Group, and then restart Windows before installing

Netscape Navigator 3.0b6.</LI>



<LI>In Windows95, you can right mouse click on the Cooltalk Watchdog Icon

and exit before installing Netscape Navigator 3.0b6. You will find the

Cooltalk Watchdog Icon (if turned on) in the right corner of the Win95

Task Bar.</LI>



<LI>During installation of CoolTalk, the command line argument for the

Watchdog is incorrect. It should read as follows:</LI>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT>wdog.exe /v </TT><I>&quot;path to CoolTalk executable&quot;</I><TT>\cooltalk.exe</TT></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<LI>If your connection to the Internet is behind a firewall, you may have

problems connecting to other CoolTalk users outside your firewall. See

your system administrator for details.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>Live3D:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>You may get an error dialog box mentioning that Netscape cannot decode

x-gzip files when the VRML worlds are loaded with Live3D. You should ignore

this error dialog and click OK.</LI>



<LI>You may experience a GPF when quitting the Navigator after having viewed

certain VRML worlds with the Live3D plugin.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>Netscape is not showing the most recent version of web pages:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>If you have old data in your disk cache, you may still see the problem

where Netscape Navigator is not showing you the most recent version of

the web pages because of daylight savings time conflicts. To remedy this

problem, clear your disk cache the first time you run the Navigator.</LI>



<P>If you have cleared your disk cache, and are still seeing this problem,

go to Help Menu|How to Give Feedback and tell us about the problem.</P>

</UL>



<LI><B>Navigator Problems:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>After setting any preferences in Mail (or News) , you need to quit

the Mail (or News) application and run it again for the value to take effect.</LI>



<LI>Pressing Spacebar will unsubscribe a newsgroup from the List, in the

News Window.</LI>



<LI>When you use the right mouse to view a single GIF image (in 256 color

mode), you might experience a &quot;screen flash&quot; when the custom

colormap is installed. The is also true for any page with one GIF image

and no text.</LI>



<LI>If you are running in 256 color mode and have a Windows background

(wallpaper) image present, minimizing then restoring Netscape, might cause

images and the Netscape logo to appear in strange colors. <B>Workarounds:</B>

1) Open a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish). 2) Remove the

Windows background image.</LI>



<LI>If Netscape is crashing in the video driver, ensure that you are using

the latest drivers for your Video card. You can obtain the latest drivers

on-line or by contacting your Video Card's manufacturer.</LI>



<LI>The Up/Down direction box in the Find dialog in Mail &amp; News are

not implemented yet.</LI>



<LI>You will not receive a warning dialog when sending a message when your

disk is out of space. An empty message will be sent to the recipient(s).</LI>



<LI>Documents in a frame won't reload. The frameset will reload, but the

individual frames won't reload.</LI>



<LI>Audio Plugin does not get launched correctly with audio file as a Mail

Attachment.</LI>



<LI>Cannot open the Navigator easily , if in the previous session one enters

non lower case letters in the Nickname column of Address Book | Item |Add

User or Add List. You will get the error message few times. Just keep clicking

the OK button until the Navigator opens.</LI>



<LI><I>Deleting Certificates:</I> When deleting certificates or CA's, it

is a good idea to exit and restart the Navigator to make certain that the

change took effect.</LI>



<LI>In Windows 95, if installing 3.0 over 2.02 without deinstalling 2.02,

you may get an error message that the older URL.DLL will be repaired when

you restart Windows. This is okay so continue with the installation.</LI>

</UL>



<P><A NAME="JavaScriptBugs"></A></P>



<LI><B>Java Bugs:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>If you can't start Java applets, make sure Java is turned on in Options|Network|Languages.</LI>
<LI>The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes.</LI>
<LI>Win 32bit build for NT &amp; 95: Insets for layout manager is wrong for adding and removing menubar.</LI>
<LI>There is a new implementation of AWT. This new implementation propagates more user events to more types of components than the JDK AWT. This can cause some programs to misbehave if they are written incorrectly.</LI>
<LI>Mouse-up events are not implemented if the pointer leaves the applet window.</LI>
<LI>The Dialog class is not yet implemented.</LI>
<LI>Java requires at least a 256 color video driver. If you want to use the Navigator with less than 256 colors, Java must be disabled.</LI>
<LI>The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text it can display. Once the window fills up, it must be cleared before new text will appear.</LI>
<LI>In order for a Date object to display the time-zone (ie. PST) the TZ environment variable must be set (for both NT and Win95).</LI>
</UL>



<LI><B>JavaScript Bugs:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>Date objects convert in string context to numeric literals spelling

the milliseconds since 1970, instead of date strings such as &quot;Thu

Aug 01 14:57:54 PDT 1996&quot;.</LI>



<LI>Pages that call <TT>document.write</TT> to generate HTML must use HEIGHT

and WIDTH attributes on their IMG and EMBED tags, to avoid crashing when

the HTML layout delayed by the unsized images finishes.</LI>



<LI>Documents that are partly source HTML loaded from a server, and partly

generated by JavaScript, can be printed, saved, or viewed, but the generated

HTML will not appear on the printout, in the saved file, or in the View

window.</LI>



<LI>Calling <TT>document.open(&quot;text/plain&quot;)</TT> crashes the

browser.</LI>



<LI>Nested tables mixed with script tags that call <TT>document.write()</TT>

can produce incorrectly formatted output, possibly including pieces of

the script tags.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>New <TT>document.write()</TT> behavior:</B> A <TT>document.write()</TT>

call from an event handler no longer keeps JavaScript variables and objects

functioning in a page. This could be a security problem. Instead, use a

separate window, or do a large write, or use frames.</LI>



<LI><B>LiveConnect Bugs:</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>Java &quot;long&quot; values can't be passed to or from javascript</LI>



<LI>JavaScript calls to overloaded Java methods may not be resolved correctly.</LI>



<LI>There is no access to multidimensional Java arrays from JavaScript.</LI>



<LI>Network activity in Java code called from JavaScript will throw an

exception.</LI>



<LI>JavaScript can't call methods which have non-system classes as arguments

(i.e. applet-specific classes). The workaround is to declare those arguments

as java.lang.Object (or some other ancestor system class) and then cast

them to the appropriate class inside the method.</LI>



<LI>If JavaScript code tries to access an applet before the applet has

finished loading, that applet will be inaccessible from JavaScript even

when the applet has finished loading. The error message will say something

like &quot;document.applets[0] has no properties.&quot; You can wait for

all applets to finish loading by waiting for the onLoad handler on the

BODY tag to be called.</LI>

</UL>



<LI><B>Putting percent signs (%) into URLs:</B> Netscape now assumes URL

encoding on <TT>mailto:</TT> URLs and other types of URLs. If you want

to put a percent sign (%) into a URL, you need to represent it as its hex

code. Substitute &quot;<TT>%25</TT>&quot; for the percent sign. For example,</LI>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT>&lt;A HREF=&quot;mailto:user%25uucp-host@somewhere.com&quot;&gt;mail&lt;/A&gt;</TT>

to send mail to: &nbsp;&nbsp; <TT>user%uucp-host@somewhere.com</TT></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<LI><B>Known bugs in International Support.</B></LI>



<UL>

<LI>If the Navigator is used on a machine using Japanese Windows locale,

the text on several buttons in the Options | General Preferences | Fonts

dialog box will mis-display. The names of the fonts may also mis-display.

However, the font functionality is unaffected. They will display correctly

when viewing documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document

encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, and the document

you are viewing was encoded using that character set).</LI>
