<H3><B>Netcaster: Integrated and Easy to Use</B></H3>

Netcaster is tightly integrated with all Communicator components, providing seamless access from the desktop to the most up-to-date information users need.&nbsp; Netcaster leverages the "point-and-click" ease of use pioneered by Navigator to offer quick access to favorite channels and offline resources.

<UL>
<LI><B>Integrated with Communicator.</B> Like all other components, simply select from the Communicator menu to access Netcaster.</LI>

<LI><B>Full-screen experience. </B>The Netcaster interface slides away discreetly to provide more screen real estate, making content and information, rather than menus and toolbars, the focus of attention. Netcaster also supports full-screen channels for the most dynamic and immersive experience. In addition, users can configure the Netcaster user interface to slide from either the right or left side of the screen to accommodate individual preferences and desktop environments.</LI>

<LI><B>Channels and Channel Finder.</B> Netcaster's easy-to-use interface provides quick access to a user's favorite channels and offline sites. Netcaster prominently features Channel Finder, the source for the most dynamic channels on the Internet, on the user interface.</LI>

<LI><B>Customizable subscriptions. </B>Users can add or subscribe to a channel and specify preferences as to cache size, the number of pages to download, and when and how often the content should be automatically updated. With Netcaster, users receive only the information they want.</LI>

<LI><B>Webtop mode. </B>Users can anchor their favorite channel in webtop mode and have it automatically launch upon startup. Webtop mode provides ever-present links to important data and allows users to monitor information delivered in the background while working on day-to-day tasks and productivity applications.</LI>

<LI>Some of the channel preferences may not be visible until you restart Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>If you add two channels with the same name, an error may occur.</LI>
