<BR>Netcaster is tightly integrated with all Communicator components, providing
seamless access from the desktop to the most up-to-date information users
need.&nbsp; Netcaster leverages the "point-and-click" ease of use pioneered
by Navigator to offer quick access to favorite channels and offline resources.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>Integrated with Communicator.</B> Like all other components, simply
select from the Communicator menu to access Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Full-screen experience. </B>The Netcaster interface slides away discreetly
to provide more screen real estate, making content and information, rather
than menus and toolbars, the focus of attention. Netcaster also supports
full-screen channels for the most dynamic and immersive experience. In
addition, users can configure the Netcaster user interface to slide from
either the right or left side of the screen to accommodate individual preferences
and desktop environments.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Channels and Channel Finder.</B> Netcaster's easy-to-use interface provides
quick access to a user's favorite channels and offline sites. Netcaster
prominently features Channel Finder, the source for the most dynamic channels
on the Internet, on the user interface.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Customizable subscriptions. </B>Users can add or subscribe to a channel
and specify preferences as to cache size, the number of pages to download,
and when and how often the content should be automatically updated. With
Netcaster, users receive only the information they want.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Webtop mode. </B>Users can anchor their favorite channel in webtop mode
and have it automatically launch upon startup. Webtop mode provides ever-present
links to important data and allows users to monitor information delivered
in the background while working on day-to-day tasks and productivity applications.</LI>

Make sure the Automatically Load Images preference in the Edit|Preferences|Advance
is checked.</LI>

<LI>
If you have a previous version of Netcaster installed, you must uninstall
it before installing this version of Netcaster. Uninstall the previous
version by doing the following:</LI>

<OL>
<LI>
Delete the Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\netcast directory.</LI>

<LI>
Delete the Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\Java\Classes\marimb10.jar
file.</LI>

<LI>
Delete the Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\Program\NetHelp\Netscape\netcastr
directory.</LI>

<LI>
Delete files from the Program Files\Netscape\Users\&lt;username>\archive
directory.</LI>
</OL>

<LI>
A Netcaster icon in StartMenu/Programs/Netscape Communicator may remain from a previous installation. Please ignore or delete this icon.</LI>


<LI>
This release has not been fully optimized for size or performance.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
After starting Netcaster, there is a significant delay before the Netcaster
window appears.</LI>

<LI>
To avoid the delay in fully rendering the Options dialog while a channel
is updating, right-click on the dialog's title bar.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
If you do not explicitly exit Netcaster before exiting Communicator, the
preferences set during that session may be lost.</LI>


<LI>
Not all menus and dialogs are fully implemented for this release.</LI>

<LI>
If you specify an invalid URL when adding a channel, the channel is added
under My Channels, but does not appear when you select it.</LI>

<LI>
If you change a webtop to a channel in Channel Properties, the webtop remains
on your screen. Close the webtop and when you select it again in My Channels,
it appears as a channel in a Navigator window.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your Communicator preferences, such as color or font, while
Netcaster is open, the buttons in the Netcaster window disappear. Change
your Communicator preferences before starting Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
Your channel settings may not be preserved if Communicator terminates abnormally.</LI>

<LI>
A webtop's indicator does not change color (blue to green) in the Netcaster
window when the webtop is open.</LI>

<LI>
If you change your screen's resolution while Netcaster is running, the
Netcaster window may no longer be visible.</LI>

<LI>
Java applets that retrieve additional classes from the network are not
fully accessible offline. Content developers must package Java applets
in JAR files or as Castanet channels.</LI>

<LI>
At most, two channels will update at the same time.</LI>

<LI>
To remove files that were cached and reclaim the disk space they occupied,
delete the channel.</LI>

<LI>
This version of Netcaster fully supports Castanet, Java, and HTML channels.
A small number of Castanet channels may need to be modified in order to
comply with Communicator's security model.</LI>

<LI>
Channels that produce extensive output to the Java console may block the
scheduling of some sites. Clear the Java console regularly with the clear
button or close it.</LI>

<LI>
Do not manipulate the Windows taskbar while running Netcaster.</LI>

<LI>
Castanet cookies, logging, and profiling are enabled by default. The Security
interface elements do not modify the behavior.</LI>
