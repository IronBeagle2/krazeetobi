<LI><B>New Icon and Animation:</B>
The throbbing N has breathed its last.  
Christopher Skinner is the 
<A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/home/contest/">winner</A> 
of the No Throbbing, Breathing, Pulsing N
contest.  Our new icon and animation is based on his design.  
Click on the new icon for a short cut to our home page.
<P>
<LI><B>Window's 32-Bit Version!</B>
<P>
We are now shipping both a 16-bit version and a
32-bit version.
<P>The 32-bit version will only run on 32-bit platforms (Windows NT & Windows 95 final beta release).
<P>
<LI><B>An External Audio Viewer on 16-bit and 32-bit:</B>
We now provide an external application to "view" audio files from the
network in the Windows versions of Netscape 1.1. Read the <A
HREF="/newsref/ref/winaudio.html">Netscape Audio Player</A> for more
information.
<P>
<P>
<LI><B>Remote Control Mechanism:</B>
You can control Netscape from outside of the application. For more
information, read <A HREF="/newsref/std/index.html#client_api">Netscape Client
APIs</A>.
<P>
<LI><B>Support for &lt;EMBED&gt; tag:</B>
You can now embed documents inside an HTML document on the Windows
version of Netscape using OLE. For more information, read <A
HREF="/assist/net_sites/embed_tag.html">Embed Tag Demonstration</A>.
<P>

<LI><B>Cache Preferences:</B>
There are several Preferences available that refer to the 
Memory cache and the Disk cache. You can set the size of these caches
through the Preferences window. A larger Disk cache means that as you
browse, files will be saved on your disk so that when you re-visit
them, they are brought up from disk rather than from the network. The cache
files have a MOZ extension and normally reside in the \netscape\cache 
directory.

<P>
In Netscape 1.0, when you asked for a document already in your cache,
Netscape would always contact the original document server and ask for
the document's header information, for comparison. This affected the
performance of the cache. In 1.1, you can control this through the
Cache preference: Verify Documents. If you set this to "Every Time",
you will have the same behavior as in Netscape 1.0. "Once per session"
means that the document is only checked the first time you use it in a
particular Netscape session. "Never" means that the server
is contacted only if the document's header information indicates that
it has expired. For the best cache performance, use "Once per
session". 
<P>
<LI><B>Security:</B>
The US version of the software now supports numerous cipher choices:
RC4-40, RC4-128, RC2-40, RC2-128, DES-64, and DES-192. The cipher
used in any particular document is displayed in the 
File Menu/Document Information
dialog box. The export version of the software, including version 1.0,
supports only RC4-40.
<P>
<LI><B>Secure News:</B>
There is support for secure news servers.  The url for secure news is
"snews://".  You can see an example of secure news in our
<A HREF=http://home.netscape.com/commun/netscape_user_groups.html>
Netscape User Groups</A>.
<P>
<LI><B>News and Mail Improvements:</B>
Improvements to the News and Mail interface, including:
     <UL>
     <LI>The Newsgroup button has returned.
     <LI>Subscribing to groups on multiple news hosts is supported.
     <LI>A new Mail Message window that also includes News Posting
     capabilities and file attachments.  Binary files that are
     mailed or posted use base64 encoding.  Attached files with high bit
     characters or long lines are encoded using quoted-printable.
     <LI>Improved presentation of newsgroups and articles.
     In addition, quoted-printable and base64
     articles and attachments are
     decoded correctly.
     <LI>A new Preference to set the maximum number of articles to
     download and thread at a time: a low number will give much better
     performance over a modem line.
     <LI>A new Preference to allow 8-bit or MIME Compliant Quoted-Printable
     Content-Transfer-Encoding for mail and news articles that contain
     high bit characters.  The default is to "Allow 8-bit".
     <LI>MIME-compliant news articles will be presented according to
     their content type.  (This means that news articles may contain
     HTML, or even encoded JPEG or GIF images.  Messages of type
     multipart/mixed are also understood.)
     <LI>Signature files are now supported in mail and in news.
</UL> 
<P>
<LI><B>Dynamic Documents:</B>
You can create documents whose contents are updated dynamically,
either on a periodic basis or irregularly.  See <A
HREF="/assist/net_sites/dynamic_docs.html">here</A> for details. <P>

<LI><B>Performance:</B>
Many operations should be faster. Going back to visited pages is now
faster, because we've devoted 2/3 of the memory cache to decoded
images. 
<P>
<LI><B>Tables:</B>
These are as defined in the current <A
HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html" TARGET="_top">HTML 3.0
draft specification</A>. For a demonstration of tables, click <A
HREF="/assist/net_sites/tables.html">here</A>.
We've also improved the appearance of table
bevels when they're over a background. 
<P>
<LI><B>Backgrounds:</B>
... and the ability to change text colors.  For a 
demonstration, click <A HREF="/assist/net_sites/bg/index.html">here</A>.
The demonstration pages will show you the correct HTML tag.
<P>
<LI><B>User Defined Backgrounds:</B>
You can now specify a default background image, as well as background
colors in the Preferences.
<P>
<LI><B>ALT tags &amp; Loading Images:</B>
We now show ALT text in images and allow you to load individual images
when Auto Load Images is turned off. To load an image, click on the
image replacement icon. To follow the image's link, click on the ALT
text, or use the popup menu.
<P>
<LI><B>Save Next Link as... and more in a Popup Menu:</B>
A Popup menu with some key commands right at your fingertips. 
Position the mouse in the document area.  
Hold the right mouse button down.  A popup menu will appear.
Different menu commands are activated depending on whether the mouse is over
an image, a link, or document whitespace.
<P>
<LI><B>Preference window:</B>
The preference window has been slightly rearranged.
<P>
<LI><B>Bug fixes</B>:
    <P>
    <UL>
    <LI><B>Many fixes since 1.0,</B> 
    including view source in external viewers,
    crashing with some video drivers on wide images, etc.
    <P>
    <LI><B>Cache Bug:</B>
    A bug in the disk cache was fixed which would sometimes cause Netscape to
    present out-of-date documents.  
    <P>
    <B>IMPORTANT:  </B>After upgrading to 1.1 it is recommended
    that you flush your disk cache to remove any incorrect information 
    that may have been
    saved by an earlier release of the Netscape Navigator.

<UL>
The self extracting executable file for Netscape contains the
initialization file
netscape.ini, which has entries for all of the values you can
customize for Netscape. Netscape will look in win.ini in the
<pre>
    [Netscape]
    ini=
</pre>
section for the location of the INI file.  If this does not exist,
Netscape will look for the INI file in the directory where it was run.

<B>Japanese Character Set Encodings</B>:
Netscape Navigator 1.1 has built-in support for browsing
Japanese Web sites.
Netscape can browse data in any of the three major Japanese
character set encodings:
<UL>
<LI>JIS (ISO-2022-JP),
<LI>SJIS (Shift-JIS) and
<LI>EUC-JP (Extended UNIX Code for Japanese)
</UL>
<P>
<uL>
<li><B>New Japanese Support</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI><b>Automatic Selection for Japanese Character Encoding</b><P>
          A new check box in the "Fonts and Colors" preference dialog enables
          the automatic selection of the Japanese character encodings
          supported by Netscape:<p>

                JIS, Shift-JIS and EUC-JP.

          If the default document encoding is Japanese and the "Auto Select"
          check box is checked, documents will be heuristically scanned to
          determine which Japanese character encoding is being used in
          documents being displayed.<p>

<LI><b>   Posting Japanese News Articles and Email</b><p>

          Japanese email and news articles posted from Netscape will be
          converted to ISO-2022-JP (JIS).  This is compliant with RFC1468
          which specifies the standard for Japanese Internet messages.<p>

          The MIME header will contain the following:<p>

                Content-Type: text/plain; charset=iso-2022-jp<br>
                Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit<p>

<LI><b> Entering Japanese Text in HTML Forms</b><p>

<li><b> Selection, Insertion, Copying & Pasting of Japanese Text</b><p>
</ul>

<LI><B>Line Wrapping for Japanese Text</B>:
Netscape relies upon "white space" to determine where to wrap lines
when laying out HTML text files in English (and other alphabetic
languages).
<P>
Japanese text does not normally include "white space" (e.g., spaces
and tabs), so Netscape 1.1 wraps lines at Japanese character
boundaries when laying out HTML text files in Japanese.
<P>
<LI><B>MIME Charset parameter in HTTP</B>:
If the MIME charset parameter is included in the HTTP header
from the server, Netscape 1.1 parses this parameter to determine the
encoding of text file.  For example:
<pre>
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
           or
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-2022-jp
</pre>
<P>
The charset names recognized by Netscape 1.1 are specified in RFC
1700 (except for the names that begin with "x-").  These include:
<UL>
<LI>us-ascii
<LI>iso-8859-1
<LI>iso-2022-jp
<LI>x-sjis
<LI>x-euc-jp
<LI>x-mac-roman
</UL>
<P>
Netscape also supports aliases for us-ascii</B>:<br>
ansi_x3.4-1968, iso-ir-6, ansi_x3.4-1986, iso_646.irv:1991,
ascii, iso646-us, us, ibm367, cp367.
<P>
Netscape also supports aliases for  iso_8859-1</B>:<br>
latin1, iso_8859-1, iso_8859-1:1987, iso-ir-100, l1,
ibm819, cp819.
<P>
<LI><B>Preferences</B>:
If the MIME charset is not specified in the HTTP headers, then
Netscape will determine the character set encoding of the text files
from a user selectable preference.
<P>
<LI><B>Document Information</B>:
The character set encoding of the current document is included in
the "Document Information..." box under the File menu.
<P>
<LI><B>System Requirements</B>:
To surf in Japanese on Windows Japanese Windows is required.  It
<B>may</B> also work on US Windows if third party Japanese enabling
software such as Win/V is being used.
<P>
To surf in Japanese on Macintosh, either KanjiTalk7 or Japanese
Language Kit (on System 7) is required.
<P>
<LI><B>Japanese demo</B>:

explore our

<DT><B> Tables </B>
<DD>You can't search for text that is contained within a table.
<DD>In rare cases, selecting text across multiple cells of a table
can cause Netscape to go into an infinite loop.  
<P>

<DT><B>Backgrounds and Transparency</B>
<DD>In 16 color VGA mode, images with transparent backgrounds do not show
properly over other background images. Instead of transparent, the
background is opaque, usually black. 
<P>

<DT><B>Image Display Bugs</B>

<DD> For video boards with Cirrus Logic video chip sets on them, and possibly for
other makers, an image can be displayed that may occasionally cause the
program to "freeze" or GP Fault in the video driver.  If this happens,
ensure you are using the latest versions of drivers for your video board.   You can 
download the latest version of the Cirrus Logic video driver from their ftp site
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.cirrus.com"> ftp://ftp.cirrus.com</a><p>

<DD>When a page (with an image on it) is re-sized so that the horizontal scroll
bar appears, sometimes the right edge of the image does not draw all the way
to the right edge of the window.  The width of the vertical blank area on
the right is about the width of the left margin, and is the color of the
background.<p>

<DD>When the video driver is in 4, 16, or 24 bits per pixel mode, drawing
transparent images over backdrop images has black flicker during drawing.
This does not happen when video mode is 8 bits per pixel.<p>

<DT><B>NAPLAYER Audio Player Bugs</B>
<DD>The NAPLAYER will report "Sound device not available" in Windows '95,
even if you have one available and working.
<P>
<DT><B>Asynchronous DNS</B>
<DD>
If you think your winsock is not handling Async DNS correctly, try
setting the Async option in the Netscape INI file to "no,"
<pre>
    [Network]
    Use Async DNS=no
</pre>
The default is to use Async DNS, not using it will result in lower
performance and can cause problems when multiple simultaneous
connections are attempted.  You can also set
<pre>
    [Network]
    Max Connections=1
</pre>
which will prevent problems when not using Async DNS but will also
result in much slower performance.
<P>
PC-NFS from Sun and Spry's newly updated stack are the only winsocks we
know of that require setting the "Async DNS" flag to "no".

<DT><B>Norton Desktop 3.0</B>
<DD>Turn FileAssist OFF if you are having problems using Netscape's Find function.
<P>
<DT><B>Highlighting more than one Screen</B>
<DD>To highlight more than one screen of text in a document, 
position the mouse where you want to start selecting text.
Hold the mouse button down while pressing the down arrow key
<P>
<DT><B>Importing Hotlists as Bookmarks</B>
<DD>Netscape has an import command on the Bookmarks window that
will read any HTML file containing links and convert those links into
bookmarks. If you would like to import your NCSA Hotlist into
Netscape, you can use the <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/">Mozilize</A>
utility to convert your hotlist to a Netscape style bookmark list.  This
program is unsupported so your results may vary.
<P>
<DT><B>Helper Applications</B>
<DD>For telnet, ftp, and for displaying audio and video,
Netscape uses "Helper Applications". These applications are configured
in your Preferences window. For
help configuring this window, check out our documentation:
<a href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/helper_apps/index.html">
Helper Applications</A>
<P>
On Windows, LVIEW31.EXE (for JPEG images),
MPEGPLAY.EXE (for MPEG movies), and  WHAM.EXE (for audio files) are
all useful applications. One site where these can be found is <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu">ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu</A>, but
that site is often difficult to reach. You can also try the mirror
site on <A

</PRE>
<P>
<DT><B>Why do I have two icons on the desktop?</B>
<DD>In order to get Netscape to show up in the task list and get multiple
top-level windows at the same time Netscape needs to keep one of its
windows iconized at all times.  The icon will always be named "Netscape"
and will not de-iconize if you click on it.  Yup, its still there in 1.1.
<P>
<DT><B>How do I use Netscape without a network connection?</B>
<DD>If you do not have a network connection but still want to user
Netscape to browse local files you should get the file
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/mozock.dll">mozock.dll</A>.
If you install this file as winsock.dll Netscape will work fine with
local file reads.  Be sure to shift-click on the above link or else
Netscape will treat it as a text document.  Doh!
If you want to get out to the rest of the net
mozock.dll is not for you.
