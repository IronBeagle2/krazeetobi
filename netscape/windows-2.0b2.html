          <A NAME="JavaScript">
          <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>JavaScript</H3>
<P>
  <B>Built-in JavaScript:</B> Netscape Navigator now includes a built-in
     scripting language, called JavaScript. JavaScript is developed based on
     the JAVA language, which extends and enhances the capability of HTML
     documents. JavaScript supports most of JAVA's expression syntax and
     basic control flow constructs, but without JAVA's strong type checking
     and static typing. JavaScript is embedded in HTML documents with a
     SCRIPT tag, and there is no compilation needed to run the script.

<P>
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/">
 JavaScript Documentation</A> is now available.<P>


	<A NAME="Mail">
	<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Read Mail with the Netscape Navigator</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>Reading your email:</B>
A new Mail Window allows you to read your email, sort the messages,
file them in folders, and mail replies.
<P>
<LI><B>New Mail Reading Window:</B>
The Mail Window has 3 panes:  a mail folder pane, a message list
pane, and a message text pane.  You can adjust the relative sizes of the
panes by dragging the pane dividers.  You may want to start by
making the mail folder pane a little wider so that you can see the
names of the mail folders.  The individual columns in each pane
can be adjusted.  Hold the mouse over the column titles.  A corner
will activate when you're at the end of a column title.  You can drag
and drop the corner to resize the columns.
<P>
Netscape comes with a sample mail message.  Click on the "inbox"
folder to see the message.  You can use the toolbar button or menu to
Get New Mail.  You can navigate through your mail messages
by clicking on the "Date", "Sender", or "Subject" fields of the
message list pane.  The buttons and Go Menu also help you navigate.
<P>
A bold message in the message list signifies that you have not read
this message yet.  Once you read it, it becomes normal (i.e. unbold).
<P>
<LI><B>Organizing your Mail:</B>
The Sort Menu allows you to view your list of messages in various ways.
You can even thread the messages by subject.  The Edit Menu lets you 
select and delete messages.  Deleted messages are put in a mail folder
called "trash".  You can create other mail folders with the File Menu.
</UL>

<B>NOTE: If you get an "FCC Error" when trying to use Mail or News, the problem is easy to fix.
</B>
<OL>
<LI> Go to the Options menu.
<LI> Select Mail and News.
<LI> Click on the Composition tab.
<LI> look at the "By default, copy outgoing messages..." field. 
The problem is that the contents of this field point to a non-existant folder.
</OL>

You can either<BR>
<UL>
<LI> 1) erase the contents of this field<BR>
<LI> 2) change the contents to point to a real mail folder.
</UL>
<P>

      <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Brand new News Interface</H3>

<UL>

<LI><B>New News Reading Window:</B>
The News Reader was re-written to provide a more concise view of the
news hosts, newsgroups, and articles.  It uses the same type of 3 paned 
window that the Mail reader uses.  Your existing <tt>newsrc</tt>
file is compatible with the new news interface.
<P>
<LI><B>Reading News Articles:</B>
Reading news is very much like reading mail messages.  Instead of
Getting New Mail, you can click on the newsgroup to bring up the
list of articles and see the new ones that have arrived.  
<P>
</UL>
</UL>


	<A NAME="Images">
	<HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Better Images and Document Presentation</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Frames -- Multiple documents on one page:</B>
Frames are a way of specifying multiple, independent, scrollable regions, or
cells, within a display window.  Each frame cell can contain a seperate HTML
document. Users can scroll and resize frame cells, at the choice of the frame
creator.  Cells can also be given NAME values,  so they can be targeted by
links in other documents, such as other cells within the same frame. These
features provide a powerful new way of presenting documents.

<P><A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/assist/net_sites/frames.html">Frame Development

<P>
<A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/frames/index.html">
    Cool Examples of Frames</A>
<P>
<A HREF="demo/framedemo.html">I've been framed!</A>
<P>

<LI><B>Targeted Windows:</B>
Browser windows can now have names associated with them.
Links in any window can refer to another window by name.
When you click on the link, the document you asked for
will appear in that named window.  If the window is not
already open, Netscape will open and name a new window for
you.  They are especially useful with frames.
<P>
Here's the <A HREF="demo/target.html" TARGET=named_window>whole story in a new window.</A>

<P>
The syntax for the targeted windows is:
<P>
&ltA HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name"&gt
<A HREF="url.html" TARGET="window_name">Click here and open a New Window</A>
&lt/A&gt
<P>
A new BASE tag allows you to pick a default named target window
for every link in a document that does not have an
explicit TARGET attribute.  It's format is:
<P>
&ltBASE TARGET="default_target"&gt
<P>

<LI><B>Client-Side Image Maps:</B>
We have implemented the 
<A HREF="ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-clientsideimagemap-01.txt"> 
IETF Internet Draft</A> for client-side image maps.
<P>
This is similar to server-side ISMAP images, in that you are
presented with an image that you can click on to take you 
to a number of different sites.  However, with server-side
image maps, the x,y coordinates of the click are sent to the
server, and the server decides which URL you see.
<P>
With client-side image maps, the MAP that relates parts of 
the image to different URLs is stored in the current file.
This saves a round trip to the server, and should present 
documents to you faster.  Since the MAP information
is stored in the document you are viewing, the destination
URLs can be displayed in the status area as you pass the mouse
over the image map.
<P>
Try the <A HREF=#ClientSide>client-side image map</A>
 at the bottom of this page.
<P>

<LI><B>Fast, Progressive JPEG images:</B>
Support for progressive JPEG images gives you high quality
images that load faster than regular JPEG or GIF images.
The progressive loading is smoother than the interlaced
GIF loading, so you can identify the image sooner.
<P>
<A HREF="demo/pjpegdemo.html">See a demo</A>
<P>
<LI><B>Automatic Dithering:</B>
In previous releases, you had to decide between 
"Dither to Color Cube" and "Use Closest Color in Color Cube".
This preference was set for every image on every page.
<P>
Now you can specify "Automatic Dithering" and Netscape will
make the decision to dither or not for each image on the
page.  In general, your images should look better with
automatic dithering.  The old options are still there,
so if you want to set them yourself, you can.
<P>
The default setting is "Automatic Dithering".
<P>

<LI><B>FONT <FONT COLOR="Red">C</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">L</FONT><FONT COLOR="Purple">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Brown">R</FONT>
 tag:</B>
In addition to specifying font colors for text and links
on a whole page, you can use the new COLOR attribute in the
FONT tag to choose colors for just part of a page, or part of a
<FONT COLOR="Brown">W</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">R</FONT><FONT COLOR="Red">D</FONT>
!
The syntax for the FONT tag is as follows:
<P>
&ltFONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
&ltFONT COLOR="#00FF00"&gt<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Green</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
&ltFONT COLOR="#0000FF"&gt<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>
<P>
You can also use Color Names instead color codes.  For Example, the syntax
could also be: 
<P>
&ltFONT COLOR="Purple"&gt<FONT COLOR="purple">Purple</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<P>

<LI><B>DIV tag:</B>
We support a new HTML 3.0 tag that lets you
<P>
<DIV ALIGN="left">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotleft&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Left justify text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="center">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotcenter&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Center some text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="right">
<tt>&ltDIV ALIGN=&quotright&quot&gt</tt>
<BR>Right justify some text by putting it
<BR>within the DIV tags.
<BR><tt>&lt/DIV&gt</tt>
</DIV>

<P>

<LI><B>WRAP attribute in the TEXTAREA tag:</B>
You can specify how to handle word-wrapping in text input areas
in forms.
<P>
<UL> <DL>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=OFF&gt -- the default setting
<DD>Wrapping doesn't happen.  Lines are sent exactly as typed.
<P>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=VIRTUAL&gt
<DD>The display word-wraps, but long lines are sent as one
line without new-lines.
<P>
<DT>&ltTEXTAREA WRAP=PHYSICAL&gt
<DD>The display word-wraps, and the text is transmitted at
all wrap points.
<P>
</DL> </UL>

<LI><B>Support for superscripts and for subscripts.</B>
<P>
The &ltSUP&gt &lt/SUP&gt tags let you define <SUP>super</SUP>scripts.
<P>
The &ltSUB&gt &lt/SUB&gt tags let you define <SUB>sub</SUB>scripts.
<P>

<LI><B>You can Quote me on that -- A stricter HTML parser:</B>
The HTML parser now pays close attention to quotes within HTML tags.
Check your HTML source for missing quote marks if you see
pages that have missing or broken images, or have pieces of
text scattered about and overlaying other parts of the document.
<P>

<LI><B>Netscape now conforms to GIF standards:</B>
Some GIF creation utilities produce GIF images that do not conform
to standards.  Such images will display empty outlines in place of
the image.  These outlines are much larger than the actual images.
The images will not be visible at all.
<P>
To repair these GIF images,
content providers can read the offending GIF image into a
different GIF utility that conforms to the GIF89a specifications,
and save the image again.
<P>

<P>

<LI><B>View Menu | Document Information in an HTML page:</B>
Document Information gives you detailed information
about all of the images and grid documents in your browser window.
The information is displayed in a separate window.  You can click
on the links in the top half of that window to change the detailed information
in the bottom half of the window.  It's also a good demonstration of grids.

<H3>Access Improvements</H3>
<UL>

<LI><B>HTTP File Upload:</B>
Previously, form input was limited to input boxes and other simple
elements like checkboxes and radio buttons.  Now you can write forms
that ask for files as input, as described in the
<A HREF=ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-03.txt>
IETF Internet Draft.</A>
<P>
A new "ENCTYPE" attribute on the &ltFORM&gt tag allows you to write forms that
take files as input.  An example of such a form would be:
<BLOCKQUOTE>

    &ltFORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&gt

<BR>Send this file: &ltINPUT NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"&gt

<BR>&ltINPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send File"&gt

<BR>&lt/FORM&gt

<H3>Additional Languages and MIME Charsets Supported</H3>
<UL>
    <LI>Previous releases support browsing Western European languages and
        Japanese.  Navigator 2.0 adds support for Central European (latin2)
        languages, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese.
    <P> 
    <LI>MIME charsets supported include:
           <UL>
                "us-ascii", "iso-8859-1", "x-mac-roman", "iso-8859-2", "x-mac-ce",

               <BR> "x-euc-tw", "x-cns11643-1", "x-cns11643-2", "big5"
           </UL>
    <P>
    <LI> The support of languages requires the appropriate system font
         is installed on your system.
    <P>      
    <LI>For Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese,
        the system must also provide support for 2-byte codes and input
        methods.  For Windows, you will need Japanese Windows, Korean
        Windows or Chinese Windows.
</UL>

<H3>META Tag Extension for MIME Charset Info</H3>
<UL>
      <LI> The IETF draft on Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup
          Language proposes an extension to the HTML META tag to allow
          MIME charset information to be contained in the HTML document:
      <p>
      &ltMETA HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; charset=ISO-2022-JP"&gt
      <p> 
      <LI>This support is in Navigator 2.0 and the MIME charset values
          supported includes all the charsets mentioned above in the section
          on "Additional Languages and MIME Charsets Supported.
</UL>

<H3>Document Encoding User Interface</H3>
<UL>        
      <LI>Document Encoding Defaults are now easier to change.  Previous
          releases provided a preference dialog to globally set the
          default character encoding of incoming documents.
      <P>
      <LI>Navigator 2.0 makes the default selection more accessible by
          moving it to the "Options|Document Encoding->" menu item.
      <P>
      <LI>Document encoding defaults are no longer global, so that a
          user may have multiple browser windows open in different
          default encodings (e.g., Japanse in one and French in another).
      <P>
      <LI>User Defined encoding is available for encodings that we have

<H3>Security Improvements</H3>

<UL>

<LI><B>Technical Background:</B>

<P>Netscape Navigator uses random information to generate session
encryption keys. The random information is found through a variety of
functions that look into a user's machine for information.  Previous
releases of Netscape Navigator were subject to potential vulnerabilities
because the size of random input was less than the size of the
subsequent
keys. This means that instead of searching through all the 2^128
possible
keys by brute force, a potential intruder only had to search through a
significantly smaller key space by brute force.

<P>Netscape Navigator 2.0 incorporates fixes to the specific portion
of our software where this potential vulnerability existed. We have
significantly increased the amount of random information
that cannot be discovered by external sources from approximately
30 bits to approximately 300 bits. Netscape has greatly expanded
the techniques and sources used to generate these amounts of
random information and the fixes have been reviewed and validated by
several weeks of intensive testing on the Internet.
<P>

<LI><B>Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security of
their
transactions:</B><P>

<UL><LI>If the attacker has physical access to your machine, security
cannot be assured.<P>

<LI>Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents can log into
your machine, little can be secure. For secure servers, any insecure
connection mechanism could be suspect. Multi-user UNIX platforms will
not be as secure as single-user machines.

<UL>Details: Some of the system specific information that is used in the
seed generation is available to any user on that system.</UL><P>

<LI>To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed into
the
seed generation algorithm. A wary user can alter his user environment
before running Netscape software. <P>

<LI>If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, they can
pretty much do anything.<P>

<LI>Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator. Use a
version native to the platform on which you are running.

<UL>Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation depends upon
the unpredictability of the low order bits of various clocks and timers.
The clocks of many emulators may have much less entropy than the actual
builtin clocks. </UL><P>

<LI>If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the security of
your X server. This is also true if the X connection is not to a local
machine as all of the events and the data from the screen read may be
captured from the ethernet.

<UL>Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input then its
randomness is not useful.</UL><P>

<LI>It is better to perform some user action before connecting to a
secure
site. This means you should not set your home page to a secure site or
launch your client from a command line to a secure site.

<UL>Details: While navigating through menus or typing into various form
fields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability of details of the user
actions to increase the entropy of the RNG state.</UL><P></UL>
