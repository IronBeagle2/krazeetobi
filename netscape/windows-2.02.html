<UL>

<LI><B>Summary Technical Background (includes 2.01 fixes):</B>
<P>
Netscape has implemented fixes to the portions of our software
containing the following problems and reviewed them with outside experts. 
<UL>
<LI>JavaScript will now be correctly limited from listing the file
names of a directory and limited from automatically posting mail and
news.
<LI>JavaScript problems have been fixed relating to document.close()
and semiautomatic file upload.
<LI>Netscape has also improved the safety of URL parsing by
disallowing gopher connections to non-standard ports and by searching
for new line characters in gopher URL  strings and stopping URLs
containing such characters from being executed.
<LI>The document information window now provides security information
for pages from memory cache.
<LI>Java problems have been fixed relating to the Princeton class loader
attack, access to DNS behind a firewall, and showDocument().
</UL>

<P>
<LI><B>Relating to JavaScript:</B>
<P>
A user's email addresses could have been inadvertently exposed to
individuals without the user knowing it, compromising the user's
privacy. Netscape Navigator 2.02 solves this privacy problem by
limiting JavaScript's ability to automatically post mail or news from
form elements. This ensures that user interaction is required to send
mail or post news messages.

<P>
Another feature of JavaScript is the ability for a server script to
list files and directories. Due to an implementation problem in
Netscape Navigator 2.0, a privacy concern existed because it was
possible for a server script to access the listing of local file
names and directories on the user's machine. This problem did not
allow the server to see the contents of any local files or modify
local files in any way. Navigator 2.02 fixes this problem by refusing
to allow a script from a server to view file names and directory
listings from the local user's machine.
<P>
Also: The document.close() method now works properly. Fixes have been
added to prevent semi-automatic file uploads.

<P>
<LI><B>Relating to Java:</B>
<P>
A problem has been fixed where, previously,  under some circumstances
the ClassLoader allowed derived classes access to native methods.

<P>
At sites where the firewall prevents DNS info from passing onto their
intranet, Navigator was failing to load applets (Java exception was
thrown). The fix allows the applet to load, but then prevents the
applet from trying to make a socket connection to its "home" host
(since the IP address was not pre-verified).

<P>
A problem has been fixed where showDocument() malfunctioned when a
server provided a location redirect to an alternate.
<P>
<LI><B>Relating to Ports:</B>
<P>
2.02 fixes a problem where it was possible for a Gopher URL to be used
to send commands to ports other than those that were reasonable for
the Gopher service. It was possible that this feature could be used
to exploit other security vulnerabilities behind firewalls. Navigator
2.02 fixes this problem by limiting the ports that a Gopher URL can
access and by disallowing certain control characters in a valid
Gopher URL.

<P>
<LI><B>Relating to General Security:</B>
<P>
The document information windows now provides security information for
all pages, including pages retrieved from the memory cache.
Previously, when you viewed document info from pages retrieved from
memory cache, you saw "Security: Unknown".
<P>
<LI><B>Relating to Cache and Date Calculations Across Timezones:</B>
<P>
The Navigator is able to correctly compare the age of a document on the
server with the corresponding document in your cache,
even if the documents are in different time zones or on oppposite sides
of a daylight savings / standard time boundary.
<P>
In other words, the reload button works, now.  
You will see the lastest copy of the document when you hit reload.
<P>

<A NAME="Java"><H3>Java Applets</H3>
<B>Support for Java Applets:</B><P>
<UL>
   <LI>Java is currently supported on the 32 bit Navigator for both Windows 95
       and Windows NT.<P> 
   <LI>There is a preference to disable Java applets located in the General panel
       of the security preferences.  Java support is enabled by default.<P>
   <LI>The version of Java supported by Netscape Navigator is compatible with the
       1.0 version of the Java(tm) Developers Kit(JDK) from Sun Microsystems.
       Please see <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.javasoft.com/JDK-1.0">
       http://www.javasoft.com/JDK-1.0</A> for more info.<P>
   <LI>Applets written for the ALPHA release of the HotJava browser are not
       compatible with this later version of Java.<P> 
   <LI>There is an index of Java applets at
       <A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.gamelan.com/">http://www.gamelan.com/ </A><P>
   <LI>For more info about Java, please see the
      <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/java_applets/index.html">
       Java Applets Page.</A>
</UL>          
<A NAME="JavaScript"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>JavaScript</H3><P>
<UL><LI>
  <B>Built-in JavaScript:</B> Netscape Navigator now includes a built-in 
     scripting language, called JavaScript. JavaScript development is 
     based on the JAVA programming language, which extends and enhances
     the capability of HTML documents. JavaScript supports most of JAVA's
     expression syntax and basic control flow constructs, but without
     JAVA's strong type checking and static typing. JavaScript is embedded
     in HTML documents with a SCRIPT tag, and there is no compilation needed
     to run the script.<P>
     See the <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/script/script_info/index.html">
     on-line JavaScript Documentation</A>.
<P>

<LI><B>Preference to disable JavaScript:</B>
A new button has been added in the Options Menu under Security
Preferences | General.  JavaScript support is enabled by default.
Reload JavaScript pages after enabling the JavaScript Preference to view
the JavaScript. Be aware that some pages will not function correctly
with JavaScript disabled.

</UL>
   <P>

<A NAME="Plug-ins"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Plug-ins</H3><P>
<UL><LI>
<B>Plug-ins:</B>
The Netscape plug-in technology enables third-party developers and
users to extend the capabilities of Netscape Navigator. Developing
Netscape plug-ins lets you create a window within the Navigator
environment to display a specified MIME-type.
<P>
See the <A HREF=../handbook/plugins/index.html>handbook</A> 
for more information about using and creating plug-ins.
<P>
<LI><B>Registered Plug-ins:</B> 
The about:plugins url shows you 
a list of MIME types for which plug-ins have been registered.
<P>
This list always contains one entry that is an asterisk (*).  This is a
default plug-in that has been registered for all MIME types that are not
intrinsically handled by the Navigator.
</UL>

<A NAME="Mail"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Read Mail with Netscape
 Navigator</H3>
<UL>

   <LI><B>Reading your email:</B> A new Mail Window allows you to read your
       email, sort the messages, file them in folders, and mail replies.<P>
   <LI><B>New Mail Reading Window:</B> The Mail Window has 3 panes:  a mail
       folder pane, a message list pane, and a message text pane.  You can
       adjust the relative sizes of the panes by dragging the pane dividers. 
       You may want to start by making the mail folder pane a little wider 
       so that you can see the names of the mail folders.  The individual 
       columns in each pane can be adjusted.  Hold the mouse over the 
       column titles.  A corner will activate when you're at the end of a 
       column title.  You can drag and drop the corner to resize the columns.<P>
       Netscape comes with a sample mail message.  Click on the "inbox" folder
       to see the message.  You can use the toolbar button or menu to Get 
       New Mail.  You can navigate through your mail messages by clicking on
       the "Date", "Sender", or "Subject" fields of the message list pane.  
       The buttons and Go Menu also help you navigate.<P>A bold message in
       the message list signifies that you have not read this message yet.
       Once you read it, it becomes normal (i.e. unbold).<P>
   <LI><B> Send Now or Send Later - Deferred Mail:</B> Netscape allows 
       you to compose all your email off-line and then send them all at once.  
       When you're in the Message Composition Window, select Deferred Delivery
       from the Options menu.  Deferred mail is stored in the OUTBOX folder. 
       When you exit the Mail Window, you will be asked if you want the messages 
       to be sent.  You can also choose "File" | "Send Mail in Outbox" (from the 
       Netscape Mail Window), to send all your deferred Mail. <p>
   <LI><B>Organizing your Mail:</B> The Sort Menu allows you to view your 
       list of messages in various ways.  You can even thread the messages 
       by subject.  The Edit Menu lets you select and delete messages. 
       Deleted messages are put in a mail folder called "trash".  You can
       create other mail folders with the File Menu.<P>
   <LI><B>Mail Password:</B> Netscape Mail remembers your mail password. 
       To enable this feature, check the &quot;Remember Mail Password&quot;
       on the Organization panel of the Mail and News preferences.<p>
   <LI><B>New Mail Indicator:</B> There is a mail preference &quot;Check
       for mail every <EM>n</EM> minutes&quot; on the Servers panel
       of the Mail and News preferences. As long as the Navigator is
       running and the Mail password has been entered or saved, Netscape
       will check for new mail at the specified frequency. If there is 
       new mail, the mail will not be automatically downloaded; the mail 
       indicator in the lower right corner of the Browser, Mail, and 
       News windows will change appearance. Click the mail indicator
       to open the Mail window and retrieve new mail.<p>
   <LI><B>Find:</B> You can search for text in the headers of mail 
       and news messages using the Find command located on the Edit menu.
       Find searches the displayed headers of the messages in the
       current folder, starting with the current message. Use Find Again
       to continue with the next message.
</UL>


<p><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Brand new News Interface</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>New News Reading Window: </B>The News Reader was rewritten
       to provide a more concise view of the news hosts, newsgroups,
       and articles.  It uses the same type of 3-paned window that the 
       Mail reader uses.  Your existing <tt>newsrc</tt> file is compatible
       with the new news interface.<P>
   <LI><B>Reading News Articles: </B>Reading news is very much like 
       reading mail messages.  Instead of Getting New Mail, you can click
       on the newsgroup to bring up the list of articles and see the new 
       ones that have arrived.  <P>
</UL>

<A NAME="Compose">
<p><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Message Composition Window</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><B>Updated Mail and News Composition:</B>
       A new Mail and News composition window lets you send new messages,
       and reply to or forward existing messages.  Use the Options Menu | Show
       All Headers command to find fields for carbon copy, blind carbon copy
       (Bcc:), and file carbon copy (Fcc:) where you can save a copy for
       yourself.<P>
   <LI><B>Link to the Address Book:</B>
       You can type the names of users or mailing lists into the To:, CC:, 
       and BCC: fields. When you click on a new field with the mouse, or hit
       tab, the email addresses will be expanded. Double-clicking on an
       entry in the address book will bring up a new Composition window, 
       addressed to that address.<P>
   <LI><B>Multiple Attachments:</B>
       The Attach button lets you add and delete multiple attachments
       to your email message, including both local files and URLs. <P>
   <LI><B>AppleDouble Attachments:</B>
       Files sent as attachments from the Macintosh version of the 
       Navigator are sent using AppleDouble encoding, which allows for 
       the preservation of Macintosh file forks. On Windows and Unix 
       versions of Navigator, you have the option of receiving these 
       attachments  as either a Macintosh file, which can be saved and
       transferred for use on a Macintosh, or as a data file which can
       be used on the receiving platform.<P>
   <LI><B>More Options:</B>
       Look at the Options Menu | Mail and News... | Compose pane for
       more mail composition options.
</UL>

<A NAME="Addressbook"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>

<H3>Address Book for Email Addresses</H3>
<UL>
    <LI><B>Address Book Window:</B>
        The address book looks and works very much like the bookmarks.
        You can view the whole address book by going to the Window Menu
        and choosing Address Book.
        <P>
        Add Users from the Address Book Window's Item Menu, or automatically
        create an entry from the Message Menu in the Mail or News window.
        <P>
        Do you have lists of people to send mail to?  In the Address Book
        window, mailing lists are represented by the folder icon. Add
        list entries from the Address Book Window's Item menu, then drag
        and drop individual users into the list/folders.
        <P>
        You can use these List and User entries in three ways.
        You can type the nicknames into the mail composition window in the 
        To:, CC:, and BCC: fields.  You can also double-click on an icon in
        the Address Book window to bring up a pre-addressed composition window.
</UL>


<A NAME="Bookmarks"><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center>
<H3>New Bookmarks Feature </H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Checks for changed Bookmarks: </B>In Bookmark window, There is a
       What's New? menu item in the File menu that brings up a window that
       you can use to identify bookmarks that have changed since you last visited
       them. You can choose to check all bookmarks in the bookmark list, or just
       the selected bookmarks and bookmarks inside selected folders.
</UL>

        <A NAME="Images"><HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Better Images and Document Presentation</H3>
<UL>
   <LI><B>Frames -- Multiple documents on one page:</B>
       Frames are a way of specifying multiple, independent, scrollable
       regions within a display window.  Each frame can contain a separate
       HTML document. Users can scroll and resize frames, at the choice of 
       the page creator.  Each frame can also be given NAME values, so they
       can be targeted by links in other documents or other frames. These 
       features provide a powerful new way of presenting documents.<P>
       <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/assist/net_sites/frames.html">Frame Development Information</A><P>
       <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/comprod/products/navigator/version_2.0/frames/index.html"> Cool Examples of Frames</A><P>
       <A HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/demo/framedemo.html">I've been framed!</A><P>
   <LI><B>Targeted Windows:</B>
       Browser windows can now have names associated with them. Links in
       any window can refer to another window by name. When you click on 
       the link, the document you asked for will appear in that named window. 
       If the window is not already open, Netscape will open and name a new 
       window for you.  They are especially useful with frames.<P>
       Here's the <A HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/demo/target.html" TARGET=named_window>whole story in a new window.</A><P>
       The syntax for the targeted windows is: 
       <p>&ltA HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/url.html" TARGET="window_name"&gt
       <A HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/url.html" TARGET="window_name">Click here and open a New Window</A>&lt/A&gt<P>
       A new BASE tag allows you to pick a default named target window for 
       every link in a document that does not have an explicit TARGET 
       attribute.  Its format is:
       <p>&ltBASE TARGET="default_target"&gt<p>
   <LI><B>Client-Side Image Maps:</B>
       We have implemented the <A HREF=http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/draft-seidman-clientsideimagemap-02.txt> IETF Internet Draft</A>
       for client-side image maps. This is similar to server-side 
       ISMAP images: You are presented with an image that you can click on
       to take you to a number of different sites. <P>

       With server-side image maps, the x,y coordinates of the click
       are sent to the server, and the server decides which URL you see.
       With client-side image maps, the MAP that relates parts of the 
       image to different URLs is stored in the current file.<P>
       
       This saves a round trip to the server, and should present documents
       to you faster.  Since the MAP information is stored in the document
       you are viewing, the destination URLs can be displayed in the status
       area as you pass the mouse over the image map.<P>Try the 
       <A HREF=#ClientSide>client-side image map</A> at the bottom of 
       this page.<P>
   <LI><B>Background Images:</B>
       Netscape no longer waits for the background image to completely
       arrive before displaying any text and images on a page. When 
       the background image has been decoded the page is redrawn to 
       include the background.<p>
   <LI><B>Custom Colormap:</B> 
       For those running in 256 color mode, pages with a single GIF
       image should look better because a custom colormap is installed.
       This is for GIF images only and not for JPEG images.  To view a 
       single GIF image, use right mouse button to click on the image,
       and choose "View this Image" from the pop-up menu.<P>
   <LI><B>Fast, Progressive JPEG images:</B>
       Support for progressive JPEG images gives you high quality images
       that load faster than regular JPEG or GIF images.  The progressive
       loading is smoother than the interlaced GIF loading, so you can identify
       the image sooner.<P>
       <A HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/demo/pjpegdemo.html">See a demo</A><P>
   <LI><B>Automatic Dithering: </B>In previous releases, you had to 
       decide between "Dither to Color Cube" and "Use Closest Color in 
       Color Cube". This preference was set for every image on every page.<P>

       Now you can specify "Automatic Dithering" and Netscape will make the 
       decision to dither or not for each image on the page.  In general, your
       images should look better with automatic dithering.  The old options 
       are still there, so if you want to set them yourself, you can.<P>

       The default setting is "Automatic Dithering".<P>

   <LI><B>FONT <FONT COLOR="Red">C</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">L</FONT><FONT COLOR="Purple">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Brown">R</FONT> tag:</B>
       In addition to specifying font colors for text and links on a whole page,
       you can use the new COLOR attribute in the FONT tag to choose colors for
       just part of a page, or part of a <FONT COLOR="Brown">W</FONT><FONT COLOR="Blue">O</FONT><FONT COLOR="Green">R</FONT><FONT COLOR="Red">D</FONT> !
       The syntax for the FONT tag is as follows:<p>&ltFONT COLOR="#FF0000"&gt<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Red</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>&ltFONT COLOR="#00FF00"&gt<FONT COLOR="#00FF00">Green</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR>&ltFONT COLOR="#0000FF"&gt<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Blue</FONT>&lt/FONT&gt<BR><p>
       You can also use Color Names instead color codes.  For Example, the 
       syntax could also be:

<H3>User Interface Changes</H3>
<UL>
    <LI><B>Rearranged Menu Bar: </B>
       A new Windows Menu has been added to the main menu bar, allowing you 
       to easily switch between the Mail, News, History, Address book and
       Bookmarks windows.  To open a New Web Browser window, use the File Menu. 
   <P>
   <LI><B>Rearranged Preferences:</B>
       Under the Options Menu, the Preferences panel is divided into
       four separate panes:
       General..., Mail and News..., Network..., and Security.  These
       changes were made to accommodate the new features in 2.02.
   <P>
    <LI><B>View Menu | Document Source: </B>
     Document Source (previously View Source) now gives you a
     multi-colored display of the HTML source of a document. It is
     displayed in a separate window that does not have menus or
     buttons. 

   <P>
   <LI><B>View Menu | Document Information in an HTML page:</B>
       Document Information gives you detailed information about all
       of the images and frame documents in a Netscape window.  
       (This information is displayed in a separate window.) 
       You can click on the links in the top half of that window
       to change the detailed information in the bottom half of
       the window.  It's also a good demonstration of frames.

        <A NAME="Access"> <HR WIDTH=30% ALIGN=center><H3>Access Improvements</H3>

<UL>
   <LI><B>HTTP File Upload: </B>Previously, form input was limited
       to input boxes and other simple elements like checkboxes and 
       radio buttons.  Now you can write forms that ask for files 
       as input, as described in the
       <A HREF=ftp://ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-html-fileupload-03.txt>IETF Internet Draft.</A><P>
       A new "ENCTYPE" attribute on the &ltFORM&gt tag allows you to 
       write forms that take files as input.  An example of such a form 
       would be:<BLOCKQUOTE> &ltFORM ENCTYPE="multipart/form-data" 
       ACTION="_URL_" METHOD=POST&gt<BR>Send this file: &ltINPUT 
       NAME="userfile" TYPE="file"&gt<BR>&ltINPUT TYPE="submit" 
       VALUE="Send File"&gt<BR>&lt/FORM&gt</BLOCKQUOTE>

   <LI><B>FTP File Upload:</B> A new menu item is activated when you
     are browsing FTP directories.   Choose File | Upload File... 
     and you will get a dialog that asks you to choose a file to
     upload to the FTP server.  You can also do this by dragging a
     file (or multiple files) from the File Manager/Explorer,
     to an FTP directory listing in the Netscape Window.  Note:
     You need "write permission" on the server where you
     are uploading the file(s) to.

       </UL><P>
   <LI>The support of languages requires the appropriate system font
       is installed on your system. <P>
   <LI>For Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese,
       the system must also provide support for 2-byte codes and input
       methods.  For Windows, you will need Japanese Windows, Korean
       Windows or Chinese Windows. <P>
   <LI>Options | General Preferences | Language "Accept Language" enables 
       the user to select a prioritized list of language/region codes that reflect
       what language a user wishes to display a document in, if that document is
       available in different language translations. The "accept language" information
       is contained in the HTTP Header's HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE. A server that provides
       different language versions of the same content could thus accommodate a user's
       preferred language. <P>
   <LI>Options | Document Encoding selection can be changed when viewing Mail
       and News in addition to the Web Browser window. The selected encoding will be
       applied to enable viewing of documents of different encodings (e.g. Japanese)
       provided the user's system supports fonts for that locale. <P> 
</UL>

<H4>META Tag Extension for MIME Charset Info</H4>

<UL>
   <LI> The IETF draft on Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup
        Language proposes an extension to the HTML META tag to allow
        MIME charset information to be contained in the HTML document:<p>
        &ltMETA HTTP-EQUIV="Content-Type" CONTENT="text/html; 
        charset=ISO-2022-JP"&gt
   <LI> This support is in Navigator 2.02 and the MIME charset values
        supported includes all the charsets mentioned above in the section
        on "Additional Languages and MIME Charsets" Supported.
</UL>

<H4>Document Encoding User Interface</H4>

<UL>
   <LI>Document Encoding Defaults are now easier to change.  Previous
       releases provided a preference panel to globally set the
       default character encoding of incoming documents.<P>
   <LI>Navigator 2.02 makes the default selection more accessible by
       moving it to the "Options | Document Encoding->" menu item. <P>
   <LI>Document encoding defaults are no longer global, so that a
       user may have multiple browser windows open in different
       default encodings (e.g., Japanese in one and French in another).<P>
   <LI>Users who want to regularly view documents in encodings other than
       Latin1 should use the Options | Document Encoding menu item to 
       choose the encoding, then select Options | Save Options to 
       make it the default setting. For example, Japanese users will 
       want to select Japanese (Auto-detect) from the Document 
       Encoding list, then choose Save Options. <P>
   <LI>User Defined encoding is available for encodings that we have
       not yet added support.

<H3>Automatic Proxy Configuration</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Automatic Proxy Configuration:</B>
    It is now easier to specify complicated proxy configurations
    for an entire site.  You can tell the Navigator to use
    different proxies depending on the 
    URL or host being contacted.  It's easier to specify a large number of
    hosts that should not be using a proxy.
<P>
Instead of specifying only one proxy per protocol, it is possible to
allow different proxies based on URL wildcard pattern matching.
You can also have multiple proxies to provide
proxy failover support if the primary proxy becomes unavailable
or unresponsive.  
<P>
<LI><B>Proxy Configuration File Format:</B>
     The proxy configuration is specified in a script and stored 
     at a particular URL on a server.  Since it is stored in a central
     location, the system administrator can easily update the proxy
     configuration for the whole site without having to reconfigure
     each individual user's Navigator.
<P>
The configuration file has the MIME content-type of 
<UL><tt>application/x-ns-proxy-autoconfig</tt></UL>
and is written in JavaScript.
<P>
We have provided a document describing the syntax for the
<A HREF="../../2.0/relnotes/demo/proxy-live.html">Automatic Proxy Configuration URL File Format.</A>
<P>
<LI><B>Using the Automatic Proxy Configuration:</B>
    To use the Automatic Proxy Configuration, go to the
    Options Menu | Network | Proxies... panel
    in the Navigator, check the Auto Proxy Configuration box
    and enter the URL of the proxy configuration file on the server.
<P>
The manual proxy configuration panel is still available.
Just check the appropriate radio button in the Proxy Preferences
panel and enter your proxy and socks hosts.
<P>
As before, the default is not to use proxies.

   <LI><B>Technical Background:</B><P>
       Netscape Navigator uses random information to generate 
       session encryption keys. The random information is found 
       through a variety of functions that look into a user's machine
       for information.  Previous releases of Netscape Navigator were
       subject to potential vulnerabilities because the size of random
       input was less than the size of the subsequent keys. This means 
       that instead of searching through all the 2^128 possible keys by 
       brute force, a potential intruder only had to search through 
       a significantly smaller key space by brute force.<P>Netscape 
       Navigator 2.0 incorporates fixes to the specific portion of our
       software where this potential vulnerability existed. We 
       have significantly increased the amount of random information from
       approximately 30 bits to approximately 300 bits. Netscape
       has greatly expanded the techniques and sources used to generate
       these amounts of random information and the fixes have been 
       reviewed and validated by several weeks of intensive testing
       on the Internet.<P>
   <LI><B>Recommendations to users of Netscape who rely on the security
       of their transactions:</B><P>
       <UL><LI>If the attacker has physical access to your machine,
               security cannot be assured.<P>
           <LI>Netscape continues to point out that if unwanted agents
               can log into your machine, little can be secure. For 
               secure servers, any insecure connection mechanism could 
               be suspect. Multi-user UNIX platforms will not be as secure
               as single-user machines.<UL>Details: Some of the system 
               specific information that is used in the seed generation
               is available to any user on that system.
       </UL><P>
   <LI>To help mitigate this, the entire user environment is passed
       into the seed generation algorithm. Wary users can alter their 
       user environment before running Netscape software. <P>
   <LI>If someone can get root (superuser) access to your machine, 
       they can pretty much do anything.<P>
   <LI>Netscape security could be weak if run on a platform emulator.
       Use a version native to the platform on which you are running.
       <UL>Details: Some of the usefulness of the seed generation 
           depends upon the unpredictability of the low order bits
           of various clocks and timers.  The clocks of many emulators
           may have much less entropy than the actual built-in clocks. 
       </UL><P>
   <LI>If you are running on a UNIX platform, make sure of the 
       security of your X server. This is also true if the X connection
       is not to a local machine as all of the events and the data from
       the screen read may be captured from the ethernet.
       <UL>Details: If the attacker is monitoring your user input 
           then its randomness is not useful.
       </UL><P>
   <LI>It is better to perform some user action before connecting
       to a secure site. This means you should not set your home page 
       to a secure site or launch your client from a command line 
       to a secure site.
       <UL>Details: While navigating through menus or typing into 
           various form fields, the Navigator uses the unpredictability 
           of details of the user actions to increase the entropy of 
           the RNG state.

<H3> Navigator Problems: </H3>
<UL>
    <LI> If you close Print Preview using the Windows System Menu
         Bar, you might Crash or the Navigator might freeze.  
         Use the Close Button in the Print Preview window to close.
     
    <LI> After setting the "Maximum Message Size" field, in Mail
         and News Preferences | Servers, you need to quit Netscape and
         run it again for the value to take effect.

    <LI> "Reply-to-Address" as specified in Mail and News Preferences
         | Identity, has not been implemented in this release.

    <LI> Pressing Spacebar will unsubscribe a newsgroup from the List, in
         the News Window.

    <LI> When Printing forms, only the Form Labels appear; and not the
         user-input text or the Radio buttons.
     
    <LI> When you use the right mouse to view a single GIF image (in 256 color
         mode), you might experience a "screen flash" when the custom colormap
         is installed.

    <LI> If you are running in 256 color mode and have a Windows
         background (wallpaper) image present, minimizing then
         restoring Netscape, might cause images and the Netscape logo
         to appear in strange colors. <B>Workarounds:</B> 1) Open
         a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish). 2) Remove
         the Windows background image.

    <LI> When Un-installing Netscape, you might get a File Error Dialog
         that says "Cannot find CTL3D.DLL"; click on the Close button
         and the Un-installation will continue.

    <LI> If Netscape is crashing in the video driver, ensure that you
         are using the latest drivers for your Video card.
         You can obtain the latest drivers on-line or by contacting
         your Video Card's manufacturer.

    <LI> The Apply button in Preferences is grayed out and not functional. 

</UL>

<A NAME=JavaScriptBugs>
<H3>JavaScript Bugs: </H3>
<UL>
        <LI>The onLoad event handler may be called early for non-frameset 
            documents that contain images.  Workaround: use window.setTimeout() 
            to poll for the reflection of form elements that your 
            onLoad handler wants to see.
        <LI>An IMG tag without HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes may cause 
            JavaScript event handlers on subsequent form elements to be ignored. 
            Workarounds: add HEIGHT and WIDTH attributes to all IMG tags, 
            or add one empty SCRIPT tag after the last form
            element that has a JavaScript event handler. 


        <LI> The lastIndexOf method should search a string backwards starting
          at the fromIndex position. In Navigator 2.02 it starts one character
          before the fromIndex position.

        <LI> You should be able to set the form object's method 
          property at any time. It is read-only in Navigator 2.02.

        <LI> The documentation for the name property states 
          "If multiple objects on the same form have the same NAME attribute, 
          an array of the given name is created automatically... 
          Elements are indexed in source order starting at 0." 
          In Navigator 2.02, elements are indexed in source order if the object
          contains an event handler. If the object does not contain an event
          handler, they are indexed in reverse order.

        <LI> Radio buttons in the same radio object should be indexed 
          in source order starting at 0. In Navigator 2.02, 
          they are indexed in reverse order.

        <LI> The window.status property always evaluates to the string
          value of window.defaultStatus.

        <LI> If you do not specify a set of windowFeatures when you call 
          window.open in a Unix environment, the window is created 
          without any of the Boolean features.

        <LI> Calling document.close() from top-level code within 
          a script tag may crash Navigator.  It is safe
          to close documents that you open; only close on the 
          currently-loading document is unsafe.
</UL>

<H3>Java problems with the 32bit Navigator:</H3>
<UL>
   <LI> Java will not run using the 32bit Trumpet Winsock.  If you want to use
        Trumpet Winsock with the Navigator, Java must be disabled.
   <LI> Java requires at least a 256 color video driver.  If you want to use the
        Navigator with less than 256 colors, Java must be disabled.
   <LI> The Java Console window has a limit to the amount of text it can display.
        Once the window fills up, it must be cleared before new text will appear.
   <LI> java.lang.Math.IEEERemainder(...) returns incorrect results.
   <LI> In order for a Date object to display the time-zone (ie. PST) the TZ
        environment variable must be set (for both NT and Win95).
   <LI> The AWT File Dialog box is not implemented.  An exception is thrown if
        you try to create a java.awt.FileDialog object.   
   <LI> The APPLET tag must have WIDTH and HEIGHT attributes.
   <LI> Applet audio sometimes doesn't work correctly on NT systems.
</UL>

<H3>Known bugs in International Support.</H3>
<UL>
   <LI> If the Navigator is used on a machine using Japanese Windows 
        locale, the text on several buttons in the Options | General
        Preferences | Fonts dialog box will mis-display. The names 
        of the fonts may also mis-display. However, the font functionality
        is unaffected. They will display correctly when viewing
        documents, mail, or news (if you map that font to the document
        encoding you have selected via Options | Document Encoding, 
        and the document you are viewing was encoded using that character set).
   <LI> Entering multi-byte characters in forms is not implemented in this release.
