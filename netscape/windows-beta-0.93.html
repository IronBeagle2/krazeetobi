<P>
You are using Netscape version 0.93 beta for Windows. 
We have tested without problems under the following Winsocks (TCP/IP
stacks):
<UL>
	<LI>Trumpet Winsock (v1.0)
	<LI>FTP Software's PC/TCP
	<LI>NetManage
	<LI>Microsoft WFW (Wolverine)
	<LI>Microsoft NT
<LI>The PC-NFS Winsock seems to have major problems with Asynchronous
DNS lookups, which we rely upon to do multiple connections. 
There is a patch for Sun's winsock at 
<a href="ftp://ftp.york.ac.uk/pub/pc-nfs/Patches">
ftp://ftp.york.ac.uk/pub/pc-nfs/Patches
</a>
... but we haven't fully tested it yet. If you run under another winsock,
please report to us how it works.  We have also noticed that FTP's
winsock sometimes gives a General Protection Fault when asked to
lookup a invalid host while on a dial-up connection.
<P>
If you think your winsock is not handling Async DNS correctly, try
setting the Async option in the Netscape INI file to "no,"
<pre>
	[Network]
	Use Async DNS=no
</pre>
The default is to use Async DNS, not using it will result in lower
performance and can cause problems when multiple simultaneous 
connections are attempted.  You can also set
<pre>
	[Network]
	Max Connections=1
</pre>
which will prevent problems when not using Async DNS but will also 
result in much slower performance.  If you discover that your
winsock implementation has problems with Async DNS please send
us complete configuration information so that we may work with the
winsock vendor to fix the problem.
</UL>

<P>
<DT><B>Installation</B>
<DD>By default, Netscape expects to live in the directory
c:\netscape, the easiest way to install Netscape is to
run the sel-extracting archive in a temporary directory and
run the setup program.
<P>
If you place Netscape in a directory other than c:\netscape you should
update the following fields in your INI file:
<pre>
          [History]
          History File=c:\netscape\netscape.hst

          [Bookmark List]
          File Location=c:\netscape\bookmark.htm

	  [Cache]
	  Cache Dir=c:\netscape\cache
</pre>
If Netscape cannot write these files (for example, if the directory doesn't
exist) Netscape will still run. However global history and bookmarks will not
be saved between sessions.<P>
You will also need to create the directory specified by the "Cache Dir"
option.  If that directory does not exist, Netscape will not be able to
do disk caching.  It is best to have a directory dedicated to disk caching
with nothing else.  Netscape periodically house-cleans the disk cache 
directory and files it doesn't know about (that start with the letter "m")
will get blown away since it will think they are orphaned disk cache files.
<P>
The setup program will update your INI and make sure the cache directory
exists.

<P>
<DT><B>Initialization File</B>
<DD>The zip file for Netscape contains the initialization file netscape.ini,
which has entries for all of the values you can customize for Netscape.
Netscape will look in win.ini in the 
<pre>
	[Netscape]
	ini=
</pre>
section for the location of the INI file.  If this does not exist, Netscape
will look in the directory where it was run for the INI file.  <B>IMPORTANT:</B>
the location of the INI files is different from what it was in Beta 0.9.


<P>
<DT><B>Importing Hotlists as Bookmarks</B>
<DD>Netscape has an import command on the Bookmarks window that
will read any HTML file containing links and convert those links into
bookmarks. If you would like to import your NCSA Hotlist into 
Netscape, you can use the <A
HREF="http://www.envmed.rochester.edu/wwwrlp/html/winh2htm.htm">Winh2htm</A>
(Windows hotlist to html) utility to convert your hotlist to HTML.
<P>
<DT><B>Helper Applications</B>
<DD>For telnet, ftp, and for displaying audio and video, 
Netscape uses "Helper Applications". These applications are configured
in your Preferences window. For 
help configuring this window, check out our documentation: 
<a href="../manual_docs/answers.html#RTFToC5">Helper Applications</A>
<P>
On Windows, LVIEW31.EXE (for JPEG images),
MPEGPLAY.EXE (for MPEG movies), and  WHAM.EXE (for audio files) are
all useful applications. One site where these can be found is <A
HREF="ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu">ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu</A>, but
that site is often difficult to reach. You can also try the mirror
site on <A
HREF="ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/</A>.

<P>
<DT><B>Printing</B>
<DD>The current beta of Netscape supports printing.  
If you experience problems please let us know.
<P>
<DT><B>Dec Alpha problems</B>
<DD>We have received reports that Netscape does not work with NT 3.5 on
Dec Alpha machines.  We are looking into this problem.
<P>
<DT><B>32-Bit Version</B>
<DD>We are not shipping a 32-bit version yet.  There are a few problems
left with Windows95 that we want to fix before releasing a 32-bit Mozilla
onto the net.
<P>
<DT><B>Forms stop displaying</B>
<DD> We think that this Beta solves the problems where form elements would
sometimes stop displaying.  If you still see this problem please let us
know.
