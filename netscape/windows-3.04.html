<A NAME="General"></A>

<H3>General Features</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>New Directory buttons:</B> The directory button toolbar now includes Destinations and People. Net Directory and Handbook have been removed.</LI>

<LI><B>New Directory menu items:</B> The Directory menu now has items for Netscape Destinations and People. Internet Directory and Internet White Pages have been removed.</LI>

<LI><B>New Navigation for Frames and the Back button:</B> Now, when you click on a link that updates a frame, pressing the <B>Back</B> button returns you to the previous state of the frame. Previously, pressing the <B>Back</B> button ignored updates within a page's frames and always returned you to the previous whole page (further back than you probably wanted). In short, navigating among frames now works on a per frame basis: pressing <B>Back</B> revisits the previous frame and pressing <B>Forward</B> revisits the frame ahead.</LI>

<LI><B>Three-pane configurability:</B> A pane layout option has been added to the <B>Mail and News|Appearance</B> panel (choose the <B>Options|Mail and News Preferences|Appearance</B> menu item). The panel offers radio buttons to designate the layout of the three panes in the Mail and News windows. Choose <B>Split Horizontal</B> (<B>Articles on top</B> on Macintosh) to align the message content pane to the right of the two split panes. Choose <B>Split Vertical</B> (<B>Articles on left</B> on Macintosh) to
align the message content pane below the two split panes. Choose <B>Stack</B> (<B>Stacked</B> on Macintosh) to align the message content pane below the two stacked panes (layered in rows atop one another).</LI>

<LI><B>Show recipient in Sent Folder and Outbox:</B> When you select a mail folder by clicking on it, the message heading pane displays the titles of messages contained in that folder. In previous versions, you'd always see the title <B>Sender</B> above a column that shows the name of the sender of the mail message. Now, in the Outbox and Sent Mail folders, you'll see the title <B>Recipient</B> instead of Sender, and the column shows the email address of the mail recipient. For sent mail, the recipient info
is much more useful than the sender info (typically yourself).</LI>

<LI><B>Compressed headers:</B> When viewing either the Mail or News window, the <B>Options</B> menu now offers a cascading (hierarchical) menu items called <B>Show Headers</B> that replaces the <B>Show All Headers</B> item. The new menu item gives you more options to control the number of header information fields displayed when viewing messages. <B>All</B> displays all possible header fields. <B>Normal</B> displays the primary address fields. <B>Brief</B> displays only subject and recipient fields.</LI>

<LI><B>Netscape Navigator Gold:</B> Netscape Navigator Gold has been updated for Win32 and Mac. Gold now lets you edit tables.</LI>

<LI><B>New Network preferences panels:</B> New Network|Protocols and Network|Languages preference panels to expand and improve user preferences for security and privacy control.</LI>

<LI><B>POP3 servers:</B> The <B>Keep Mail on Server</B> and <B>Maximum Message Size</B> options now work even with POP3 servers that do not implement the UIDL command.</LI>

<LI><B>Special characters:</B> Additional entity names such as "&amp;pound" are now implemented.</LI>
</UL>

<A NAME="Layout"></A>
<H3>Layout Features</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Frame Border Control:</B> You can use the FRAMEBORDER, BORDER, and BORDERCOLOR attributes to control the display type, width, and color of frame borders. For precise control of border appearance, use all three attributes.</LI>

<P>The FRAMEBORDER attribute determines how frame borders are displayed (outline-3D or plain). The attribute can be set with the value FRAMEBORDER=YES (outline-3D border) or FRAMEBORDER=NO (plain border), and can be used in the &lt;FRAMESET> tag or the &lt;FRAME> tag. The default is FRAMEBORDER=YES.
When used in the &lt;FRAMESET> tag, the FRAMEBORDER attribute sets the default value for all frames in the frameset. When used in the &lt;FRAME> tag, the attribute applies only to the particular frame, overriding any frameset attribute. Because borders are shared between frames, a border will be plain only if all adjacent frames have their attribute set FRAMEBORDER=NO.

<P>The BORDER attribute determines the thickness of frame borders for all frames in a frameset tag. The attribute can be set with a value from 0 to N, and can only be used on the outermost &lt;FRAMESET> (not on a per-frame basis). For example, setting BORDER=0 positions adjacent frames with no border space between them, BORDER=3 positions adjacent frames with 3 pixels of border space between them, and so on. The default is BORDER=5.

<P>Remember, when neither a FRAMEBORDER or BORDER attribute is specified, the default is an outline-3D frame with a width of 5. Setting FRAMEBORDER=NO without a BORDER attribute displays a plain border with a width of 5. Unless you explicitly specify BORDER=0, a frame border is displayed. 

<P>Note also that when FRAMEBORDER=YES and BORDER is used, the thicker, outline borders acquire a 3-D appearance.

<P>The BORDERCOLOR attribute determines the color of frame borders. The attribute can be set with a color name or RGB value, and can be used in the &lt;FRAMESET> tag or the &lt;FRAME> tag. When used in the &lt;FRAME> tag, the attribute attempts to set the colors of the frame's borders. When used in the &lt;FRAMESET> tag, the attribute attempts to set the colors of all borders of all frames in the frameset.

<P>Because frame borders are shared, border color conflicts are resolved as follows: The attribute appearing in the outer &lt;FRAMESET> has the lowest priority. This is, in turn, overridden by the attribute used in a nested &lt;FRAMESET> tag. Finally, the BORDERCOLOR attribute used in a &lt;FRAME> tag overrides all previous &lt;FRAMESET> tag uses. If there is a conflict for two colors of equal priority both set on the same edge, the behavior is undefined.

<LI><B>Multi-Column Text:</B> The &lt;MULTICOL> tag is a container, and all the HTML between the starting and ending tag will be displayed in a multi-column format. The tag can be nested, although multi-column text within multi-column text becomes quickly unreadable. The attributes of this tag are COLS, GUTTER,
and WIDTH.</LI>

<P>The COLS attribute is mandatory and controls how many columns the display will be split into. Layout will attempt to flow elements evenly across the columns to make each column have about the same height. Unless the WIDTH attribute is specified, column with is adjusted to fill the available view.

<P>The GUTTER attribute controls the pixels of space between columns. It defaults to a value of <TT>10</TT>. 

<P>The WIDTH attribute controls the width of an individual column. All columns are always the same width, so the overall width of a multi-column layout is:
<BR><TT>(cols * width) + ((cols - 1) * gutter)</TT>

<LI><B>Horizontal and Vertical Spacing:</B> A new tag called &lt;SPACER> provides better control over the spacing of objects and whitespace in HTML pages. The attributes to spacer are TYPE, SIZE, WIDTH, HEIGHT, and ALIGN.</LI>

<P>The TYPE attribute has three possible values: horizontal, vertical, and block. These correspond to the three types of spacing control delineated above. The default value is horizontal.

<UL>
<LI>The horizontal spacer inserts horizontal space between words. The width of the space is controlled by the SIZE attribute.</LI>

<LI>The vertical spacer inserts vertical space between lines. Implicit in this spacer is a line break to end the current line, then the vertical space is added before the beginning of the next line. The height of the space is controlled by the SIZE attribute.</LI>

<LI>The block spacer behaves almost exactly like an invisible image. When using this type of spacer the SIZE attribute is ignored, and instead the WIDTH, HEIGHT, and ALIGN attributes are applied just as they would be for the &lt;IMG> tag.</LI>
</UL>

The SIZE attribute only applies when the spacer has a type of horizontal or vertical. Then this attribute controls the absolute width or height in pixels of the spacing added.

<P>The WIDTH attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block. Then this attribute controls the absolute width in pixels of the spacing rectangle added.

<P>The HEIGHT attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block. Then this attribute controls the absolute height in pixels of the spacing rectangle added.

<P>The ALIGN attribute only applies when the spacer is of type block. Then this attribute controls the alignment of the spacing rectangle in exactly the same way it would control the alignment of an &lt;IMG> tag.

<LI><B>Strikeout and Underline Text:</B> Netscape has always supported strikeout text in the form of the &lt;STRIKE> tag. Now Netscape also supports an alternative syntax, the &lt;S> tag, while maintaining support for the &lt;STRIKE> tag as backwards compatibility.</LI>

<P>Netscape now supports underlined text using the &lt;U> tag. The tag causes all text between the start and end tag to have a solid underline drawn along the common baseline of the text.

<LI><B>JavaScript Evaluation in HTML:</B> JavaScript evaluation in HTML attribute values allows JavaScript to be dynamically evaluated in the right-hand side of an HTML attribute name/value pair (that is, when calculating the values of HTML attributes). This allows the attributes of one HTML element
to depend on information about previously placed elements on the page.</LI>

<P>JavaScript evaluation uses the HTML entity sequence as follows:
<P><TT>&amp;lt; == "&lt;"</TT>

<P>Where "&amp;" denotes the start of an entity, and ";" terminates it.
In this case a dynamic entity is in the form of a JavaScript expression
enclosed in curly braces:

<P><TT>&amp;{<I>javascript_expression</I>}; == "<I>returned_string</I>"</TT>

<P>JavaScript entities concatenate with the surrounding text:

<P><TT>"&amp;{10 * 10};%" == "100%"</TT>

<P>JavaScript entities can only be interpreted on the right-hand side of
HTML attribute name/value pairs.
<LI>
<B>FONT FACE=fontName:</B> The FONT FACE attribute lets you specify the
names of specific fonts as your preferred font choices in the format:</LI>


<P><TT>&lt;FONT FACE="font1,font2,fontN"> &lt;/FONT></TT>

<P>For example, if font1 is not available, font2 is used. If no specified
font is available, the default font is used. COLOR and SIZE attributes
can be specified along with the FACE attribute.

<P><TT>&lt;FONT FACE="Garamond,Helvetica,Times"> &lt;/FONT></TT>
<LI>
<B>Support table cell background colors:</B> You can specify a background
color to be used when displaying table cells. To specify a table background
color use the <B>bgcolor</B> attribute. Nested tables inherit background
colors.</LI>

<TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER WIDTH="20%" >
<CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells</CAPTION>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#FFDDDD">One Color</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD BGCOLOR="#CCFFFF">Another Color</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
The <B>bgcolor</B> tag specifies one of the supported color names and can
be used with the following tags: <B>table</B>, <B>td</B>, <B>th</B>, and
<B>tr</B>.

<P>Here's the HTML that produced the table on the right.
<PRE>
&lt;TABLE ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 WIDTH=20%>
&nbsp;&lt;CAPTION CENTER Valign=BOTTOM>Color Cells&lt;/CAPTION>
&nbsp;&lt;TR>&lt;TD BGCOLOR=#ffdddd>One Color&lt;/TD>&lt;/TR>
&nbsp;&lt;TR>&lt;TD BGCOLOR=#ccffff>Another Color&lt;/TD>&lt;/TR>
&lt;/TABLE></PRE>
</UL>
<A NAME="Message"></A>
<H3>
Message Composition and Viewing Improvements</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
<B>Long-line Wrapping in Message Composition window:</B> The new Message
Composition window menu item <B>View|Wrap Long Lines</B>, when checked,
automatically line-wraps the messages you send such that no line is longer
than 72 characters. The width of the Message Composition window does not
affect line-wrapping, nor are the line breaks you see necessarily the wrapping
that is sent. When unchecked, messages are sent without automatic line-wrapping
and the line breaks that you see are sent. The default is checked.</LI>


<P>In previous versions, long lines were wrapped at the width of the window.
This gave a "What You See Is What You Get" aspect to the message composition
window. Regardless of whether the sender had allowed text to auto-wrap,
or had hit return at the end of every line, or had resized the window,
the recipient of the message would see the same line breaks as the sender.

<P>However, problems occurred when senders made their composition windows
very wide for ease of editing. It was very easy to accidentally send out
messages with long lines that exceeded the 80 column limit. To many recipients,
such messages would be very difficult to read.

<P>In this version, outgoing text is wrapped at 72 columns, regardless
of the size of the window. This makes the composition window less WYSIWYG,
but it does make it much harder to accidentally generate unreadable messages.

<P>There is (and has been) a single exception to the line wrapping rule:
Lines which have the character <B><TT>></TT></B> as their first character
are never wrapped. Such lines are usually a part of quoted text and it
is important to preserve the special character at the start of each line.

<P>It is also still true that lines beginning with <B><TT>></TT></B> will
appear to be wrapped in the Message Composition window if the lines are
longer than the window is wide. This is a property of the platform-provided
text editors. At the time the message is sent, these lines will be effectively
unwrapped.

<P>Since the column at which word-wrapping occurs is no longer tied to
the size of the window, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option has been added
to turn off word-wrapping on the Message Composition window. This is for
the less common case where you need to send a message with specially-formatted
text such as wide tables or charts, or data where wrapping the lines would
damage the data.

<P>When this option is selected, two things happen: First, the text area
no longer does word-wrapping (a horizontal scrollbar will be presented
instead). Second, the generated message will have exactly the line breaks
that the user inserted explicitly and no automatic wrapping of any kind
will occur.

<P>The default for the option is to wrap lines and the option is not persistent.
If you turn wrapping off, the particular composition window is affected
only this one time (since no-wrapping is an unusual case).
<LI>
<B>Long-line Wrapping in Mail and News windows:</B> The new menu item in
the Mail and News windows <B>View|Wrap Long Lines</B>, when checked, displays
long lines in the message in shorter, more numerous lines. When unchecked,
long lines are more likely to extend off the screen and require the horizontal
scroll bar for viewing. The default is unchecked.</LI>


<P>Messages marked as <TT>text/plain</TT> should have preformatted line
breaks so that the text does not require reformatting or wrapping. However,
two forms of messages cause problems:

<P>First, there are the messages which have line breaks at the end of each
line, but which have lines which are too long (say, 100 character lines
rather than 79 character lines.) Such messages were easy to generate with
earlier versions of Netscape by simply making the Message Composition window
wider than its default size.

<P>Second, there are the messages which only have line breaks at the end
of each paragraph. These messages are generated by software which does
not understand the requirements of Internet mail and inappropriately assumes
that the recipient of the message will always be able to rewrap the messages.

<P>To address both types of message, the <B>Wrap Long Lines</B> option
has been added to the <B>View</B> menu on both the Mail and News windows.
This allows lines which are longer than the width of the window to be wrapped.
Turning this option on will probably make correctly-formatted messages
look worse, however, for messages which are incorrectly formatted with
overly long lines, the option makes the messages readable.

<P>Note that though there are now line-wrapping options on both the Message
Composition window, and on the Mail and News windows, they do very different
things. The former affects the actual text that will be mailed out; the
latter merely controls the presentation of received messages without actually
altering them.</UL>
<A NAME="MIME"></A>
<H3>
MIME Parser Improvements</H3>
The MIME message display engine has been significantly improved. A number
of new features have been added and a number of bugs have been fixed.
<UL>
<LI>
<B>When saving attachments, a more reasonable default file name will be
used:</B> In earlier versions, the <B>Save This Link As</B> command (and
its shortcut, the shift-click or option-click gesture) did not generally
offer a good default file name when prompting for the place to save the
attachment. This is now fixed: the suggested file name should always be
the original name of the attached document.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Support for uuencoded data in non-MIME messages is greatly improved:</B>
In previous versions of Netscape, uuencoded pseudo-attachments were not
handled as well as full-fledged MIME attachments; the handling of uuencoded
data in non-MIME messages should now be virtually indistinguishable from
real MIME attachments, from the end user's point of view.</LI>


<P>In previous versions, uuencoded data was automatically decoded only
if it appeared to be on of the built-in image types (GIF, JPEG, and XBM);
and once the uuencoded data was encountered, it was considered to extend
from the <TT>begin</TT> line to the end of the message. This has been fixed:
<UL>
<LI>
Any number of uuencoded segments in a message will be displayed as attachments:
the uuencoded data is considered to extend from the <TT>begin</TT> to the
<TT>end</TT> line, and then the remainder of the message will be presented
in the usual way.</LI>

<LI>
Any type of uuencoded data will be treated as an attachment, not just images.
If the extension on the name of the attached file is one that indicates
that it is a GIF, JPEG, or XBM, then the attachment will be decoded and
displayed inline; otherwise, it will be presented as a normal attachment
link, making it easy to decode and save the data to a file.</LI>

<LI>
The <B>View Attachments as Links</B> menu item now affects the presentation
of uuencoded attachments in the same way it has always affected MIME attachments.</LI>

<LI>
When uuencoded attachments are saved, they will always be decoded first,
just as base64-encoded data is.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>BinHex data is recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> In much the same
way that we notice the presence of uuencoded data in non-MIME messages,
we now also notice BinHex data.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Sun MailTool attachments are supported:</B> Attachments of the form
generated by Sun's MailTool (messages of type <TT>x-sun-attachment</TT>)
are recognized, and displayed just like normal MIME messages.</LI>

<LI>
<B>The multipart/alternative MIME type is supported:</B> The <TT>multipart/alternative</TT>
Content-Type is a container that includes different versions of the same
document; for example, a <TT>text/plain</TT> version, followed by a <TT>text/html</TT>
version, followed by an <TT>application/postscript</TT> version. Netscape
will present to the user only one of the versions, the highest ``resolution''
version that can be displayed inline.</LI>


<P>Netscape does not currently have the ability to generate messages which
contain <TT>multipart/alternative</TT> data, but it is now capable of displaying
it (for compatibility with existing and future mailers which do generate
such messages.)
<LI>
<B>The message/external-body MIME type is supported:</B> The <TT>message/external-body</TT>
Content-Type is a MIME representation of what is essentially a URL: it
describes a method for retrieving a document from the net. The directly-supported
<TT>message/external-body</TT> access methods are <TT>ftp</TT>, <TT>anon-ftp</TT>,
<TT>local-file</TT>, <TT>afs</TT>, <TT>mail-server</TT>, and <TT>url</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Uuencoded data is only recognized in non-MIME messages:</B> We no longer
recognize uuencoded data in arbitrary parts of type <TT>text/plain</TT>:
we now only do this auto-<WBR>recognition in messages which have no Content-Type
specified. That is, if the message is a full-fledged MIME message, we always
believe the Content-Type of that message. If it says it's plain text, then
we treat it as plain text and don't play guessing games behind its back.</LI>


<P>However, if the message does not have a Content-Type, then it is not
a MIME message, and we assume that it may contain either text, or uuencoded
data, or BinHex data, or any combination thereof.

<P>So if you come across a message that contains uuencoded data, and we
did not present it as an attachment, then that's probably because that
message was generated by simply pasting the uuencoded data into the main
body of the message with a MIME-compliant mailer.

<P>The proper way to send uuencoded data with a MIME-compliant mailer is
to attach the uuencoded file to the message, so that it shows up as a MIME
part, with some non-text Content-Type, and <TT>x-uuencode</TT> as its Content-Transfer-Encoding.</UL>

<B>Resizing a window reloads its documents from cache:</B> Previously,
resizing caused JavaScript to rerun the same scripts as when the page first
loaded. Now, the document is reloaded from cache (scripts are not rerun,
the load and unload events are not sent, and user-defined variables and
properties are not reinitialized). There is currently one exception: Resizing
can cause HTML objects such as forms and links to lose their user-set properties
(the objects are reflected again by the reload).</LI>

<LI>
<B>NOSCRIPT tag:</B> A <TT>&lt;NOSCRIPT>...&lt;/NOSCRIPT></TT> tag has
been added so that if a user has JavaScript turned off in the Network|Languages
preferences panel or if a user's browser application does not support JavaScript,
the user sees the HTML between the noscript tag and its end tag.</LI>

<LI>
<B>SRC attribute:</B> The <TT>&lt;SCRIPT></TT> tag now has an additional
attribute that allows a JavaScript file to be specified as the JavaScript
source (rather than embedding the JavaScript in the HTML). Attributes within
the SCRIPT tag can now be specified as follows:</LI>


<P><TT>&lt;SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JavaScript SRC=mySource.js></TT>

<P>where <TT>mySource.js</TT> is the URL (relative or full address) of
the JavaScript source code file.

<P>The LANGUAGE attribute is mandatory unless the SRC attribute is present
and specifies the scripting language. The SRC attribute is optional and,
if given, specifies a URL that loads the text of a script. Both attributes
may be present.

<P>The SRC attribute specifies the scripting language by using the .js
suffix. The suffix must be mapped by the web server to the MIME type "application/x-javascript"
which the server sends back in the HTTP GET reply's Content-type: header.
Without a properly configured server (one that maps .js filename suffix
to application/x-javascript MIME), Netscape won't respond properly with
the data coming back in the HTTP response to the SRC-initiated request.
<LI>
<B>Data tainting security model:</B> You can set NS_ENABLE_TAINT to enable
JavaScript in one window to see properties of a second window, regardless
of which server provided the second window's document. When JavaScript
in the first window attempts to send to a server (other than the one that
originated the data) data derived from the second window's tainted properties,
a confirming dialog is brought up so that the user can cancel or confirm
the transaction.</LI>


<P>To set NS_ENABLE_TAINT:
<UL>
<LI>
On UNIX, use setenv.</LI>

<LI>
On Windows, use set.</LI>

<LI>
On Macintosh, edit the resource with type 'Envi' and number 128 in the
Netscape application by removing the two ascii slashes "//" before the
NS_ENABLE_TAINT text at the end of the resource.</LI>
</UL>
You can use two new functions, taint() and untaint(), to mark and unmark
an argument datum with taint associated with the current script. For example,
to remove taint from a form input element so that it can be sent to another
server by the server's script, you would say:

<P><TT>untainted = untaint(document.form1.input3)</TT>
<BR><TT>// now untainted can be sent in a URL or form post by other scripts</TT>

<P>Neither taint() nor untaint() modifies its single argument. Rather,
both functions return a marked or unmarked reference to the argument object,
or a copy of the primitive type value (number or boolean value).
<LI>
<B>JavaScript reflection of plug-ins:</B> Allows developers to dynamically
determine what plug-ins are installed on the client. By making the list
of installed plug-ins accessible through JavaScript, content developers
can write simple scripts to display embedded plug-in data if the appropriate
plug-in is installed, or display some alternative information (image, text,
etc.) if not.</LI>


<P>JavaScript currently has a global "navigator" object which contains
properties for information not associated with any particular document.
This object now has two additional properties: a "mimeTypes" object and
a "plugins" object.

<P>The mimeTypes object is an array of all MIME types supported by the
client (either internally, via helper apps, or by plug-ins). Each element
of the array is a mimeType object, which has properties for its type, description,
and file extensions.

<P>The plugins object is an array of all plug-ins currently installed on
the client. Each element of the array is a plugin object, which has properties
for its name and description, as well as a subarray of mimetype objects
for the types supported by that plugin.</UL>

<B>The APPLET tag now supports an ARCHIVE attribute:</B> This can improve
applet download time by reducing the number of HTTP connections required
to fetch applet code. Example:</LI>

<PRE>
&nbsp; &lt;applet archive="Nuclear.zip"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; code="NuclearPlant.class"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; width=680 height=473>
&nbsp; &lt;/applet>


This will cause the file Nuclear.zip to be downloaded to the user's
disk, and will search it for the NuclearPlant class and the classes it
requires. The zip file is found relative to the codebase path, and must
not be compressed.&nbsp; Classes not in the zip file will still be searched
for via the old mechanism if required.</PRE>

<B>Unicode Support: </B>Java applets will now display all Unicode characters
which can be rendered with an existing system font. Support is no longer
limited to the Latin-1 subset of Unicode: Support is provided for Western

Japanese, and Korean. This feature is currently available on the UNIX and
Macintosh platforms.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
To protect the privacy of applets, System.in, System.out, and System.err
have been made "final" (they are effectively constants, and can not be
changed by applets).</LI>

<LI>
Thread.suspend() can result in deadlocking the Java subsystem (for example,
suspend an applet that is holding system critical resources). The call
has been annotated with a warning that prints on the Java Console when
this method is invoked. Use of the call should be avoided. Future releases
might not support the call.</LI>

<LI>
For the privacy of each applet, Thread.stop(t) (the version that takes
an argument) is now restricted to only take an instance of a ThreadDeath
class. Passing other types results in a security exception.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
If you had previously installed the CoolTalk Watchdog, you need to uninstall
it by un-installing Netscape Navigator, and then reboot your machine before
installing the latest version of the Navigator. In WindowsNT and Windows3.x,
you can also do that by removing the Cooltalk Watchdog Icon from the Startup
Program Group, and then restart Windows before installing Netscape Navigator
3.0.</LI>

<LI>
In Windows95, you can right mouse click on the Cooltalk Watchdog Icon and
exit before installing Netscape Navigator 3.0. You will find the Cooltalk
Watchdog Icon (if turned on) in the right corner of the Win95 Task Bar.</LI>

<LI>
During installation of CoolTalk, the command line argument for the Watchdog

After setting some preferences in Mail (or News), you need to close the
Mail (or News) Window and open it again for things to take effect.</LI>

<LI>
When you use the right mouse button to view a single GIF image (in 256
color mode), you might experience a "flash" when the custom colormap is
installed. The is also true for any page with only one GIF image and no
text.</LI>

<LI>
If you are running in 256 color mode and have a Windows background (wallpaper)
image present, minimizing then restoring Netscape, might cause images and
the Netscape logo to appear in strange colors. <B>Workarounds:</B> 1) Open
a new Netscape window (then close it if you wish). 2) Remove the Windows
background image.</LI>

<LI>
If Netscape is crashing in the video driver, ensure that you are using
the latest drivers for your Video card. You can obtain the latest drivers
on-line or by contacting your Video Card's manufacturer.</LI>

<LI>
The Up/Down direction box in the Find dialog in Mail &amp; News is not

are received as Mail Attachments. When received, you can save the attached
plugin as a file - (just click the right mouse button, and choose Save
Link As). Then drag the file you saved to the Browser Window.</LI>

<LI>Navigator does not hang when submitting forms using the POST method.  This may have occured with previous versions of Navigator with users that had a slower connection and/or connections to a heavily loaded server.</LI>

<LI>Cannot open Navigator easily? If in the previous session you entered upper

Date objects convert in string context to numeric literals spelling the
milliseconds since 1970, instead of date strings such as "Thu Aug 01 14:57:54
PDT 1996".</LI>

<LI>
Pages that call <TT>document.write</TT> to generate HTML must use HEIGHT
and WIDTH attributes on their IMG and EMBED tags, to avoid crashing when
the HTML layout delayed by the unsized images finishes.</LI>

<LI>
Documents that are partly source HTML loaded from a server, and partly
generated by JavaScript, can be printed, saved, or viewed, but the generated
HTML will not appear on the printout, in the saved file, or in the View
window.</LI>

<B>New <TT>document.write()</TT> behavior:</B> A <TT>document.write()</TT>
call from an event handler no longer keeps JavaScript variables and objects
functioning in a page. This could be a security problem. Instead, use a
separate window, or do a large write, or use frames.</LI>

<LI>
Java "long" values can't be passed to or from javascript</LI>

<LI>
JavaScript calls to overloaded Java methods may not be resolved correctly.</LI>

<LI>
There is no access to multidimensional Java arrays from JavaScript.</LI>

<LI>
Network activity in Java code called from JavaScript will throw an exception.</LI>

<LI>
JavaScript can't call methods which have non-system classes as arguments
(i.e. applet-specific classes). The workaround is to declare those arguments
as java.lang.Object (or some other ancestor system class) and then cast
them to the appropriate class inside the method.</LI>

<LI>
If JavaScript code tries to access an applet before the applet has finished
loading, that applet will be inaccessible from JavaScript even when the
applet has finished loading. The error message will say something like
"document.applets[0] has no properties." You can wait for all applets to
finish loading by waiting for the onLoad handler on the BODY tag to be
called.</LI>

<B>Putting percent signs (%) into URLs:</B> Netscape now assumes URL encoding
on <TT>mailto:</TT> URLs and other types of URLs. If you want to put a
percent sign (%) into a URL, you need to represent it as its hex code.
Substitute "<TT>%25</TT>" for the percent sign. For example,</LI>

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT><NOBR>&lt;A HREF="mailto:user%25uucp-host@somewhere.com">mail&lt;/A></NOBR></TT>
