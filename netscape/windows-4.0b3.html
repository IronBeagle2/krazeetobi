HTML Elements with Cascading Style Sheets"</A>. Specifically, the <TT>CLIP</TT>,
<TT>OVERFLOW </TT>and <TT>HEIGHT </TT>properties are now implemented and
percentage values can be specified where appropriate.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
HTML Layers</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The <TT>SRC </TT>attribute has been added to the layer tag for encapsulating
an arbitrary HTML URL inside a layer.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>HEIGHT </TT>attribute was added to the <TT>&lt;LAYER></TT>
tag.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>WIDTH</TT>, <TT>HEIGHT </TT>and <TT>CLIP </TT>attributes of
the <TT>&lt;LAYER></TT> tag now accept percentage values.</LI>

<TT>SHOW </TT>for both <TT>&lt;LAYER> </TT>and <TT>&lt;ILAYER></TT>.</LI>

<LI>
PAGEX and PAGEY attributes have been added for page-relative positioning
of <TT>&lt;LAYER></TT> and <TT>&lt;ILAYER>.</TT>&nbsp;</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>&lt;NOLAYER></TT> tag has been added to permit authors to incorporate
content for older browsers that are not layer-capable.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Dynamic Layers</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
Every layer in JavaScript now has a <TT>DOCUMENT </TT>property that
scopes all the reflected HTML objects inside the layer.&nbsp; Similarly,
JavaScript code&nbsp; exists inside a<TT> &lt;LAYER></TT> tag will be scoped
to the containing layer rather than the window. <I>THIS CHANGE MAY BE INCOMPATIBLE
WITH SCRIPTS DESIGNED TO WORK WITH COMMUNICATOR PR2.</I></LI>

<LI>
It is possible to create new layers after the document has loaded by
using JavaScript's new layer constructor method.</LI>

<LI>
The document.write method can be used to dynamically generate the contents
of a specified layer.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>&lt;LAYER></TT> tag accepts <TT>onLoad, onMouseover, onMouseout,
onFocus </TT>and <TT>onBlur</TT> JavaScript event handlers.</LI>

<LI>
More sophisticated event handling can take place through the <TT>setCapture</TT>,
<TT>releaseCapture</TT> event mechanism</LI>

<LI>
All document objects now have <TT>WIDTH </TT>and <TT>HEIGHT </TT>properties,
which reflect the width and height of the content of the (layer's) document
and which can be used to set the scrolling limits of the window.</LI>

<LI>
HTML that can be used to set the <TT>SRC </TT>attribute (or <TT>SRC
</TT>property) can now contain <TT>&lt;HEAD></TT> and <TT>&lt;BODY></TT>
tags.</LI>

<LI>
There are now <TT>pageX</TT> and <TT>pageY</TT> properties that provide
page-relative positioning information.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>LOAD </TT>method has been added to the layer object.&nbsp;
It can be used to simultaneously set a layer's <TT>WIDTH </TT>and <TT>SRC</TT>.</LI>

<LI>
The <TT>offset </TT>method for layers has been renamed to <TT>moveBy</TT>,
so as to be more consistent with the similar method on Window objects.</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
This release has not been fully optimized for size or performance.
16 MB of RAM or more is recommended.</LI>

<LI>
Users running Windows NT with NTFS file systems might have trouble

the Communicator compents. Have the system administrator modify the registry
to give you complete access to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Netscape
key.</LI>

<LI>
Plug-ins installed in previous versions of Navigator are not automatically
transferred to Communicator. Re-install these plug-ins.</LI>

server. The setup wizard does not have any way of specifying the default
discussion host as a secure Collabra server.</LI>

<LI>
If you receive the error "<TT>dbg "VR_Create Registry:3</TT>," remove
the older copy of <TT>nsreg.dat</TT> that was placed on your system during
a previous installation.</LI>

<LI>
Functions on local menus and assigned keyboard accelerators that can</LI>
<BR>
<BR>destabilize NetHelp are not fully blocked.
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
Navigator</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Resizing the window of a page containing plug-ins, forms, or stylesheets,
causes the plug-in, form, or stylesheet to lose its original position or
formatting.</LI>

<LI>
The File, Edit Frame menu item is not working correctly.</LI>

<LI>
Some web counters are not displayed correctly in Navigator.</LI>

<LI>

<LI>
JDK 1.1 packages missing in this beta include java.math and sun.rmi</LI>

<LI>
The java.security package is unsupported</LI>

<LI>
On Unix, mouse focus is broken for some applets.&nbsp; A workaround
is to place the cursor in the location field and tab to the applet.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
JavaScript</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The View Source and Save commands do not capture HTML output by document.write()
on the PC Windows Navigator.</LI>

<LI>
JavaScript does not handle multi-byte character set encodings (such
as Shift-JIS).</LI>

<LI>
Unload:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
The unload event is not cancellable via 'return false' from within
the onUnload event handler..</LI>

<LI>
unload events can be lost when the page is unloaded before the event
is sent.</LI>

<LI>
onUnload may run after the page's HTML objects have been discarded,
but before the onUnload event handler function has been discarded.</LI>

<LI>
in nested frames the unload event is handled only by the top level
window.</LI>
</UL>

<LI>
Resizing of windows:</LI>

<UL>
<LI>
can enter a race condition with JavaScript that is currently writing
to the window.</LI>

<LI>
in a window containing frames, event handler code for buttons and for
the host window is sometimes lost during resize.</LI>

Windows 3.1. Enable JavaScript under Edit/Preferences/Advanced if you have
pages that use JavaScript, or if you have pages with style sheets.</LI>

<LI>
The Image onAbort event handler does not work correctly.</LI>

<LI>

For example, var size = new java.awt.Dimension (...)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Layering and absolute positioning</H3>

<UL>
<LI>

<LI>
The <TT>ALIGN </TT>attribute might not be obeyed for applets and plug-ins
inside layers.</LI>

<LI>
Capturing layer events (with the <TT>captureEvents</TT> method) is
not implemented yet.</LI>

<LI>
Some layer information is not preserved across window/frame resize.
For example, stacking order, layer content if it is generated with document.write.&nbsp;
JavaScript timeouts are also lost after a window/frame resize.</LI>

<LI>
Negative values for the <TT>Z-INDEX</TT> attribute on <TT>LAYER</TT>
and <TT>ILAYER</TT> tags are not recognized.</LI>

<LI>
Clicking on a link in a <TT>SRC </TT>layer, where the link has no <TT>TARGET</TT>
attribute, causes the page to be loaded into the top-level window,&nbsp;
instead of replacing the layer.&nbsp; It is not possible to target URLs
at layers as with frames and the back/forward buttons do not work with
layers.</LI>

<LI>
The new <TT>WIDTH </TT>and <TT>HEIGHT </TT>properties added to the
document object may conflict with user-defined variables of the same name.&nbsp;
It is recommended that scripts containing these properties be modified
to use differentlly-named</LI>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>variables or that the <TT>var </TT>keyword is used to declare such variables
before they are used to eliminate the conflict.
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
Composer</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
Composer plug-in windows sometimes open behind the Composer window.
Bring them to the front with the task bar.</LI>

<LI>
Composer Plug-ins do not work with this release for Prime Windows 16-bit
platforms. This problem only occurs if you have manually installed a Composer
Plug-in. If a Composer Plug-in is installed, and you open a Composer window,
the Composer window will not respond to mouse clicks or keystrokes. Exit
Communicator, remove the Composer Plug-in from your Plug-ins folder, and
restart Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
The Edit Frame command is not working correctly. The Edit Frame command
edits the frame set rather than the selected frame pane.</LI>

<LI>
Trying to use an external HTML editor or image editor does not work
in this release.</LI>

<LI>
Composer does not resolve links properly if escape characters are contained
in the URL.</LI>

<LI>
The Tools, Language menu item is not available in the plain text mail
composer. Change the language in Composer. Changes apply to plain text
mail as well.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Messenger and Collabra</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The font in the subject field might appear smaller than normal.</LI>

<LI>
Opening a draft s saved with a blank recipient field defaults the recipient
to draft@netscape.com. Delete this address entry prior to sending the draft.</LI>

<LI>
Opening an encrypted message saved as a draft does not work. Do not
save a draft with the encyption option checked in the compose window.</LI>

<LI>
When you set up your certificate, leave the ask for a password option
at the defualt setting. If you change the option, you might encounter a
system halt when replying to an encrypted message.</LI>

<LI>
In the Security Advisor, the options to ask for a password every time
and to ask for a password after a varying number of minutes are not working.
Use the option to ask for a password per session.</LI>

<LI>
You need a certificate of your own (in addition to the recipient's
certificate) prior to sending any encrypted mail to the recipient.</LI>

<LI>
Composing a message from the web browser or from the address book does
not check the encrypted or signed options by default even if it is set
in the Security Advisor. Verify the encrypted and signed options from the
options tab in the compose window.</LI>

<LI>
No visual indication exists for the offline or online states. Verify
the current state by looking at the File menu. It states either Go Offline
or Go Online.</LI>

<LI>
In the offline state, choosing the Send toolbar button in the Compose
window places the message to the Outbox to send at a later time.</LI>

<LI>
In the offline state, accessing getting new messages causes Communicator
to try to go online.</LI>

<LI>
The number shown in the Offline Groups preferences and in the Download
dialog as being selected for offline reading may show 0. Choose Select
Discussions to view the accurate number of discussion groups selected for
download.</LI>

<LI>
A problem exists with reading a mail message containing a web page.
Persistent error dialogs appear.</LI>

<LI>
An address book upgraded to Communicator PR3 cannot be used in Communicator
PR2 or earlier.</LI>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>
The No Pages to Print error occurs if you have scrolled down to the
bottom of a message. Scroll back to the top of the message and print again.</LI>

<LI>
If you get a system halt when invoking the Compose window, rename <TT>abook.nab</TT>
(address book file) located in your Users Profile directory.</LI>

<LI>
Some preference settings are not completely implemented. In such cases,
this release uses the settings from Netscape Navigator 3.x.</LI>

<LI>
The Add to Address Book button in the Search Directory dialog does
not work. Selected names are not added to the address book. Access the
LDAP search feature from within the address book, select the desired name,
and choose to compose a message. Copy the address, and then from the address
book, add a new user and paste the address in the specified field.</LI>

<LI>
Shortcut keys might not bring up the correct dialog or perform the
correct action for Windows NT 3.51.</LI>

<LI>
The default values for the Disk Space tab in Mail and Discussions Preferences
are not optimally set if you previously used PR2. If using these options,
specify the values you want to use.</LI>

<LI>
The Next Folder and Next Unread Folder commands under the Go menu within
the Message window are not working.</LI>

<LI>
In the Mail and Discussions Preferences, Identity section, include
a valid user name and domain name in the E-mail field (for example, johndoe@company.com).
If you do not include the domain name, a system halt might occur when composing
with the HTML Composer.</LI>

<DT>
<B>Messenger</B>&nbsp;</DT>

<UL>
<LI>
Adding an entry, currently not in the personal address book to a mailing
list, results in a dialog asking to add that entry to your personal address
book. In this dialog, choosing No is the same as choosing Cancel.</LI>

<LI>
The progress dialog remains at 100% for longer than necessary before
continuing to download other messages, especially when using filters for
incoming messages. This can be ignored.</LI>

<LI>
Make sure all cards in your address book contain email addresses. If
there is not an email address associated with a card in your address book,
Communicator might halt.</LI>

<LI>
If you encounter a general protection fault in <TT>msvcrt.dll</TT>
when sending a message, exit Communicator.&nbsp; This is caused by a .tmp
file Windows limitations. See your system administrator or equivalent about
removing these .tmp files.&nbsp; Afterwards, you can send messages from
Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
The Empty trash menu item is disabled from the Message List window.
Empty the trash folder from the Message Center.</LI>

<LI>
After you get new messages, the message you had selected before downloading
stays current. To get to the first new (unread) message, click Next Unread
on the toolbar.</LI>

<LI>
If Communicator has not accessed a mail folder (and built a summary
file for it internally), a mail filter using that folder might not correctly
filter messages to that folder. The messages appear in your Inbox rather
than in the designated folder.</LI>

<FONT SIZE=+0>Mail with IMAP Servers</FONT></H3>

<UL>
<LI>
When using Communicator with some IMAP servers, you may wish to specify
an IMAP mail directory.&nbsp; Access the Mail &amp; Groups Preferences.
Under the Mail Server section, choose More Options. Specify the mail directory
in this dialog. Exit and restart Communicator.</LI>

<LI>
When creating IMAP4 folders on a mail server, use only ASCII characters.
If folders are named with European accented characters or Chinese/Japanese/Korean
double-bye characters, the names are unreadable. Once created, these folders
cannot be deleted.</LI>

<LI>
Trying to perform operations with online folders prior to logging in
might cause problems. These operations include emptying the online trash
folder, renaming online folders, and creating any online folders.</LI>

<LI>
Filing a message from a discussion group in an online folder results
in an empty dialog. File newsgroup messages in a local mail folder.</LI>

<LI>
You might get prompted for a POP password when sending a message under
IMAP. Enter your POP password and the message is sent.</LI>

<LI>
You can access IMAP4 Servers with this version of Communicator. Synchronization
of online and offline mail foldersfunctionality is limited..</LI>

<LI>
If you accessed an IMAP server in Communicator PR1 and have not used
PR2, a directory or mail folder named IMAPMailboxes appears after you log
in to an IMAP server. Delete the folders in the IMAPMailboxes folder or
move them elsewhere.</LI>

<LI>
After switching between IMAP and POP servers, exit and restart the
application.</LI>

<LI>
You can specify a directory for your IMAP folders. Set this preference
in Mail and Groups preferences under the Mail Server section. Click More
options and set the IMAP mail directory.</LI>

<LI>
If you mark all messages Read or Catch up by Date, the next time you
get new messages, those messages become marked as unread again.&nbsp; Manually
mark each message as Read by selecting each one or clicking the green Unread
indicator in the Message List window.</LI>

<LI>
Mail filters are supported on server folders in IMAP mode, but not
for local folders.</LI>

<LI>
From the Message Center, the File, Empty Trash Folder menu item is
enabled after you select a mail folder in the Message Center. Emptying
the Trash empties both your online Trash folder, as well as your local
Trash folder (POP server), if one exists.</LI>

<LI>
You might not get a login prompt when you open your inbox. The inbox
window appears, the Netscape logo is animated, but you are not prompted
for your password. To avoid this problem, do not bring up the Message Center
from Collabra, Discussions file menu, but instead use the Message Center
from the menu. You can also select another IMAP folder from the folder
drop-down list in the Inbox. This causes the login dialog to appear. Log
in and switch to the Inbox folder.</LI>

<LI>
MIME HTML messages (mail with embedded images) does not display properly
when read with IMAP.</LI>

<LI>
After creating a new profile and starting Communicator, make sure the
default news server in the Mail and Groups preferences dialogs is filled
in. If not, a general protection fault upon accessing the Subscribe to
Groups dialog occurs..</LI>

<LI>
On slower systems, there might not be appropriate feedback as you access
the Subscribe to Groups dialog. If you hear the hard drive being accessed,
then Communicator is still active. It may take a few minutes for the list
of newsgroups to display.</LI>

<LI>
Signed messages originating from the Windows 3.1x version of Communicator
appear with invalid signatures on other platforms.</LI>

Browser/Display</H3>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Browsing or displaying Unicode pages/mail/news (UTF-7, UTF-8, UCS-2)
is now supported for many languages. Communicator can use appropriate font
glyphs matching the Unicode code points from the user's local fonts. New
encoding menu items, UTF-7 and UTF-8 have been added. Though not in the
encoding menus, UCS-2 auto detection is supported. (Bi-directional and
complex-ligature languages are not supported.)</LI>

<LI>
US Windows 95/NT users can display Chinese, Japanese, and Korean pages/mail/news
if appropriate fonts are installed. A native operating system (such as
Japanese Windows 95) is not required for display. The input in Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean, however, does require appropriate native operating
system or equivalents. If you use native Windows 95/NT systems such as
Japanese Windows 95, you can display other Asian languages, with appropriate
fonts.</LI>

<LI>
On Windows 95/NT, it is no longer necessary to make registry modifications
to use Unicode fonts. Communicator can now use appropriate native or Unicode
fonts automatically.</LI>

<LI>
All Unicode conversions are now based on Unicode Standard 2.0.</LI>

<LI>
NCR (Numeric Character References) and NE (Named Entities) display
properly if the character in question is available in the chosen encoding.
NCR's are interpreted as Unicode code points in the decimal format. If
the corresponding character does not exist in the chosen encoding, then
"?" will be displayed.</LI>

<LI>
Many new languages are added in the Accept-Language Preferences Window
for convenience. The Accept-Language option is used to indicate the user's
preferred language(s) when sending requests to HTTP servers, which in turn
can use this information to send back documents matching the user's preferences.</LI>

<LI>
Though no menu item is available for this function, Communicator currently
sends out the user's system default character set and UTF-8 as 'minimally'
acceptable character sets. Accept-Charset information can be used to improve
communication between Communicator and directory servers by providing the
servers the information on what character sets Communicator can accept
from them.</LI>

<LI>
Japanese automatic code detection has been improved, particularly for
EUC.</LI>

<LI>
Korean browsing now features automatic code detection between ISO-2022-KR
and EUC-KR.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Composer</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
The HTML Composer now automatically adds character set information
to the edited document in the form of a&nbsp; Meta-Charset attribute within
the &lt;HEAD> ... &lt;/HEAD> tags. The Composer preserves the existing
character encoding when saving a document, but the user can also change
it if so desired. (For Japanese, currently, saving into ISO-2022-JP (JIS)
is not supported, but this function will be added in future. Saving an
original non-Unicode document into a Unicode encoding is not supported
in this release.)</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Mail</H3>

<UL>
<LI>
You can compose and send rich-text mail (HTML) in all the languages
supported.</LI>

<LI>
Searching and filtering European /Asian languages in the local Mail
folders has been improved.</LI>

<LI>
Searching and filtering European /Asian languages are not currently
supported for directories in remote servers.</LI>

<LI>
All address book /vCard fields such as First Name, Last Name, Nickname,
Company now accept input in European accented-characters and Chinese/Japanese/Korean
2-byte characters.</LI>

<LI>
You can enter European/Asian Nicknames or First Names in the To: mail
field, and they will be resolved to real e-mail addresses based on the
Address Book entries.</LI>

<LI>
Searching European /Asian languages is also supported in the local
Address Book.</LI>

<LI>
Korean mail messages are now transmitted using the 7-bit ISO-2022-KR
encoding. News articles are posted using the EUC-KR encoding. Currently,
the same message cannot be sent to both the mail and news servers except
in the 8-bit EUC-KR. We recommend sending messages separately to the mail
and news servers in such a case.</LI>

<LI>
When creating IMAP4 folders on a mail server, use only ASCII characters.
If folders are named with European accented characters or Chinese/Japanese/Korean
double-bye characters, the names are unreadable. Once created, these folders
cannot be deleted.</LI>
</UL>

<H3>
Java</H3>
</UL>

<UL>
<UL>
<LI>
Windows 95/NT Communicator can display Chinese, Japanese, and Korean
strings in Java applets if the appropriate fonts are available on the system.
It required an additional registry setting in Navigator 3 to use Unicode
fonts, but this is no longer necessary. UNIX currently requires custom
resource settings in addition to fonts.</LI>

<LI>
Chinese, Japanese, and Korean input is possible in Java AWT TextArea
and TextField windows. Communicator does not provide its own input method,
and so the user's system must have native input methods for these languages.</LI>

<LI>
All the JDK 1.1 internationalization classes are incorporated into
Communicator.</LI>

messages. Use Mail Filter Rules in the Edit menu to create filters.</LI>

<LI>
<B>Views</B> - You can display five different views in the Thread window.
They are: New, Threads with New, Watched, Ignored, and All. Use the Messages
command in the View menu to change views to one of these options:</LI>

<UL><B>Threads with New</B> - Only unread messages appear. If your messages
are sorted by thread and the unread message is a reply, the "parent" of
this reply also displays.
<BR><B>Watched</B> - Only new messages which belong to a thread that is marked
"watched" (using Watch Thread from the Message menu) appears in this view.
For example: When you only have time to read new messages for the threads
that you've marked watched, you can access those threads directly by choosing
the Watched view after getting new mail or opening a discussion group.
<BR><B>Ignored</B> - All messages, including messages which belong to a thread
that is marked "ignored" (Ignore Thread command in the Message menu)&nbsp;
appear in this view.
<BR><B>All</B> - All messages, except ignored threads, appear in this view.
<BR>Note: When switching views, you may not see any changes because the views
are cached. If this occurs, use the "All" view and select another message
to clear the cache or close and reopen the folder or discussion group.

<DT>
<B>New</B> - Only unread messages appear.</DT>
</UL>

<LI>
<B>Showing More Columns in the Thread Window</B> - Communicator defaults
to showing a specified set of columns in the Netscape Message Center and
the Netscape Message List window. You can increase or decrease the number
of columns shown by clicking on the &lt; or > buttons at the right of the
column headings.</LI>
