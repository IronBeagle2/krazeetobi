<b>Netscape Navigator 1.1 Beta 1 will expire on April 1, 1995.</b>
</center>
<hr size="3">

<h2>Update &amp; Version Information</h2>
<ul>
<li>This is a beta version of 1.1.  The currently released Netscape Navigator
version 1.0N will continue to be
available on our server until the final release of 1.1.
        <li>Customers who bought 1.0 will be entitled to a free version of
1.1 when it is officially released; these customers will be able to
download a 1.1N version and be licensed to use this version.
        <li>Customers will not automatically receive the 1.1 version in
the mail.  It will be up to the customer to download the new version
from our home pages.
<li>Licensed 1.0 customers will be able to transfer whatever time
remains of their 90 days of support to the 1.1 version once it is
officially released.
</ul>

<h2>Pricing and Availablity</h2>
<ul>
<li>We will not be selling version 1.1 until it is officially released.
However, if you purchase version 1.0 now you will be entitled to a
free update to the final version of 1.1.
<li>We expect to release version 1.1 under the same terms and pricing
as the 1.0 release, including a 1.1N release.  The
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/http://home.netscape.com/MCOM/solutions_docs/pricing.html">pricing
page</a> gives current pricing for all of the released Netscape products.
</ul>

<h2>Netscape's Commitment to Standards</h2>
<blockquote>
A number of new features were added as part of the version 1.1
product.  These were based upon emerging standards and proposals.  The
new HTML tags are based upon the HTML 3.0 proposal.  The HTTP
additions are based upon discussions within the working group mailing
list and the MIME standard.  Netscape Communications Corporation is an
active participant in all Web-related standard bodies and is a
founding Full Member of the W3 Consortium.  Please read our discussion
of Netscape's commitment to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/http://home.netscape.com/info/open-standards.html"> open
standards</a>, if you're interested in more information. <p>

Please be advised, however, that since HTML 3.0 is still an evolving
proposal, some of the new tags supported in Netscape 1.1b1 may change
before the final Netscape 1.1 release.  We will support the syntax
that is agreed upon for the final HTML 3.0 specification.  This could
mean that some of the tags which are supported in the beta will change
between now and the final release as the standard evolves.
</blockquote>

<h2>What's New?</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Bug fixes</b>:
Many fixes since 1.0, including view source in external viewers,
crashing with some video drivers on wide images, etc.
<p>
<li><b>Performance:</b>
Many operations should be faster. Going back to visited pages is now
faster, because we've devoted 2/3 of the memory cache to decoded
images.
<p>
<li><b>Window's 32-Bit Version!:</b>
We are now shipping both a 16-bit version and a
32-bit version.
<p>The 32-bit version will only run on 32-bit platforms (Windows NT).
<p>
The 32-bit version will also run under Windows95.  However, the October94
release of Windows95 seems to have a bug in the DDE libraries. If you edit
your INI file and add:
<pre>
    [Main]
    DDE Hosed=yes
</pre>
DDE will not be used and Netscape should run. <p>
<li><b>Tables:</b>
These are as defined in the current <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">HTML 3.0
draft specification</a>. For a demonstration of tables, click <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/demo/1.1b1/index.html">here</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Backgrounds:</b>
... and the ability to change text colors -- for a
demonstration, click <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/demo/1.1b1/index.html">here</a>.
Since Netscape 1.1a1, we've changed the HTML for backgrounds. The
demonstration pages will show you the new HTML.
<p>
<li><b>User Defined Backgrounds:</b>
You can specify default background colors and images in the Preferences.
<p>
<li><b>Remote Control Mechanism:</b>
You can control Netscape from outside of the application. For more
information, read <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/info/APIs/index.html">Netscape Client
APIs</a>.
<p>
<li><b>Dynamic Documents:</b>
You can create documents whose contents are updated dynamically,
either on a periodic basis or irregularly.  See <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/demo/1.1b1/index.html">here</a> for details. <p>
<li><b>Support for &lt;EMBED&gt; tag:</b>
You can now embed documents inside an HTML document on the Windows
version of Netscape using OLE. For more information, read <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/demo/1.1b1/embed/index.html">Embed Tag Demonstration</a>.
<p>
<li><b>An External Audio Viewer on 16-bit and 32-bit:</b>
We now provide an external application to "view" audio files from the
network in the Windows versions of Netscape 1.1b1. Read the <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/info/winaudio.html">Netscape Audio Player</a> for more
information.
<p>
<li><b>Popup Menu:</b>
A Popup menu with some key commands right at your fingertips. To
see the pop-up menu on the Windows or X platform, hold down the right
mouse button over the document area. On the Macintosh, hold down your
mouse button for about 1 second to make the popup menu appear.
<p>
<li><b>ALT tags &amp; Loading Images:</b>
We now show ALT text in images and allow you to load individual images
when Auto Load Images is turned off. To load an image, click on the
image replacement icon. To follow the image's link, click on the ALT
text, or use the popup menu.
<p>
<li><b>Mail Sending &amp; News Posting Improvements:</b>
A new Mail Message window that also includes News Posting
capabilities and file attachments.
<p>
<li><b>Cache Preferences:</b>
There are several Preferences available, now, that refer to the
Memory cache and the Disk cache. You can set the size of these caches
through the Preferences window. A larger disk cache means that as you
browse, files will be saved on your disk so that when you re-visit
them, they are brought up from disk rather than from the network.
<p>
In Netscape 1.0, when you asked for a document already in your cache,
Netscape would always contact the original document server and ask for
the document's header information, for comparison. This affected the
performance of the cache. In 1.1, you can control this through the
Cache preference: Verify Documents. If you set this to "Every Time",
you will have the same behavior as in Netscape 1.0. "Once per session"
means that the document is only checked the first time you use it in a
particular Netscape session. "Upon Expiration" means that the server
is contacted only if the document's header information indicates that
it has expired. For the best cache performance, use "Once per
session".
<p>
<li><b>Security:</b>
The US version of the software now supports numerous cipher choices:
RC4-40, RC4-128, RC2-40, RC2-128, DES-64, and DES-192. The cipher
used in any particular document is displayed in the Document Information
dialog box. The export version of the software, including version 1.0,
supports only RC4-40.
<p>
<li><b>News Reading Improvements:</b>
Improvements to the News interface, including:
     <ul>
     <li>A new Preference to set the maximum number of articles to
download at a time: this will give much better performance over a
modem line.
     <li>New presentation of newsgroups and articles.
     <li>MIME-compliant news articles will be presented according to
     their content type.  (This means that news articles may contain
     HTML, or even encoded JPEG or GIF images.  Messages of type
     multipart/mixed are also understood.)
     <li>Signature files are now supported in mail and in news
     <li>Subscribing to groups on multiple news hosts is supported.
     </ul>
<p>
<li><b>Preference window:</b>
The preference window has been slightly rearranged.
<p>
</ul>

&lt;!------------------------------------------------------------!&gt;
<hr size="4">
<h2>Initialization File</h2>
<ul>
The self extracting executable file for Netscape contains the
initialization file
netscape.ini, which has entries for all of the values you can
customize for Netscape. Netscape will look in win.ini in the
<pre>
    [Netscape]
    ini=
</pre>
section for the location of the INI file.  If this does not exist,
Netscape will look in the directory where it was run for the INI file.
</ul>

<hr size="4">
<h2>Surfing the Net in Japanese</h2>
<b>Japanese Character Set Encodings</b>:
Netscape Navigator 1.1 Beta has built-in support for browsing
Japanese Web sites.
Netscape can browse data in any of the three major Japanese
character set encodings:
<ul>
<li>JIS (ISO-2022-JP),
<li>SJIS (Shift-JIS) and
<li>EUC-JP (Extended UNIX Code forJapanese)
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Line Wrapping for Japanese Text</b>:
Netscape relies upon "white space" to determine where to wrap lines
when laying out HTML text files in English (and other alphabetic
languages).
<p>
Japanese text does not normally include "white space" (e.g., spaces
and tabs), so Netscape 1.1 wraps lines at Japanese character
boundaries when laying out HTML text files in Japanese.
<p>
<li><b>MIME Charset parameter in HTTP</b>:
If the MIME charset parameter is included in the HTTP header
from the server, Netscape 1.1 parses this parameter to determine the
encoding of text file.  For example:
<pre>
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
           or
        Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-2022-jp
</pre>
<p>
The charset names recognized by Netscape 1.1 are specified in RFC
1700 (except for the names that begin with "x-").  These include:
<ul>
<li>us-ascii
<li>iso-8859-1
<li>iso-2022-jp
<li>x-sjis
<li>x-euc-jp
<li>x-mac-roman
</ul>
<p>
Netscape also supports aliases for us-ascii</b>:<br>
ansi_x3.4-1968, iso-ir-6, ansi_x3.4-1986, iso_646.irv:1991,
ascii, iso646-us, us, ibm367, cp367.
<p>
Netscape also supports aliases for  iso_8859-1</b>:<br>
latin1, iso_8859-1, iso_8859-1:1987, iso-ir-100, l1,
ibm819, cp819.
<p>
<li><b>Preferences</b>:
If the MIME charset is not specified in the HTTP headers, then
Netscape will determine the character set encoding of the text files
from a user selectable preference.
<p>
<li><b>Document Information</b>:
The character set encoding of the current document is included in
the "Document Information..." box under the File menu.
<p>
<li><b>System Requirements</b>:
To surf in Japanese on Windows Japanese Windows is required.  It
<b>may</b> also work on US Windows if third party Japanese enabling
software such as Win/V is being used.
<p>
To surf in Japanese on Macintosh, either KanjiTalk7 or Japanese
Language Kit (on System 7) is required.
<p>
<li><b>Additional Information</b>:
Additional information and Japanese Web pages will be made
available at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</a>.  Stay
tuned.

<h2>Known Problems/Bugs</h2>
<dl>
<dl>
<p>
<dt><b>Options-Menu-Preferences</b>
<dd>This current beta release does not remember some of the Preferences' settings from one Netscape session to the other. For example: Netscape picks up the default font size everytime you run it.
<p>
<dt><b>Printing &amp; Backgrounds</b>
<dd>You cannot print a page that has a background. If you do you may
get some text, but mostly blank pages.
<p>
<dt><b>Selection</b>
<dd>When text is selected and there is a background image, the
selected text might not be readable.
<p>
<dt><b>Backgrounds and Transparency</b>
<dd>In 16 color VGA mode, images with transparent backgrounds do not show
properly over other background images. Instead of transparent, the
background is opaque, usually black. Performance for transparent
images over backgrounds isn't very good.
<p>
There is also a known problem with the rendering of transparent
images; when a transparent image appears in a page that does not have
a backdrop image, the transparent image will occasionally be shown
with a "random" color at its background.
<p>
<dt><b>Image Display Bugs</b>
<dd>Some VGA board video drivers have a bug in them which causes GPFs.  Among
these drivers are those used with the Cirrus Logic chip set, and ATI boards,
to name a few.  If you encounter GPFs or program lockups while viewing pages
with images on them, try one of the following work-arounds:
     <ul>
     <li>Change the bits per pixel depth from 8 bits, (256 colors), to
16 bits, (35K or 65K colors), or 24 bits, (16 million).
     <li>Change the "Logical DPI" value.  This may default to some value
e.g., 120, and would therefore be changed to 96.  Or, the values may
may be named, "Small resources/text" vs. "Large resources/text"
     </ul>
<p>
<dt><b>NAPLAYER Audio Player Bugs</b>
<dd>The NAPLAYER will report "Sound device not available" in Windows '95,
even if you have one available and working.
<p>
<dt><b>Ansynchonous DNS</b>
<dd>
If you think your winsock is not handling Async DNS correctly, try
setting the Async option in the Netscape INI file to "no,"
<pre>
    [Network]
    Use Async DNS=no
</pre>
The default is to use Async DNS, not using it will result in lower
performance and can cause problems when multiple simultaneous
connections are attempted.  You can also set
<pre>
    [Network]
    Max Connections=1
</pre>
which will prevent problems when not using Async DNS but will also
result in much slower performance.
<p>
PC-NFS from Sun and Spry's newly updated stack are the only winsocks we
know of that require setting the "Async DNS" flag to "no".
<p>
<dt><b>Dec Alpha problems</b>
<dd>We have received reports that Netscape does not work with NT 3.5 on
Dec Alpha machines.  We are looking into this problem.
</dl>
</dl>

&lt;!------------------------------------------------------------!&gt;
<hr size="4">
<h2>Notes, Tips, and Information</h2>
<dl>
<dl>
<dt><b>But what about the animating N?</b>
<dd> We will have a new animation and
desktop icon by the time Netscape 1.1 ships. In fact, you might want
to participate in the <a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/contest/index.html">animation contest</a>.
<p>
<dt><b>Importing Hotlists as Bookmarks</b>
<dd>Netscape has an import command on the Bookmarks window that
will read any HTML file containing links and convert those links into
bookmarks. If you would like to import your NCSA Hotlist into
Netscape, you can use the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/unsupported/windows/">Mozilize</a>
utility to convert your hotlist to a Netscape style bookmark list.  This
program is unsupported so your results may vary.
<p>
<dt><b>Helper Applications</b>
<dd>For telnet, ftp, and for displaying audio and video,
Netscape uses "Helper Applications". These applications are configured
in your Preferences window. For
help configuring this window, check out our documentation:
<a href="/web/19990429140139/http://home.mcom.com/home/manual_docs/answers.html#RTFToC5">Helper Applications</a>
<p>
On Windows, LVIEW31.EXE (for JPEG images),
MPEGPLAY.EXE (for MPEG movies), and  WHAM.EXE (for audio files) are
all useful applications. One site where these can be found is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu/">ftp://ftp.cica.indiana.edu</a>, but
that site is often difficult to reach. You can also try the mirror
site on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/">ftp://gatekeeper.dec.com/pub/micro/msdos/win3/</a>.

</pre>
<p>
<dt><b>Why do I have two icons on the desktop?</b>
<dd>In order to get Netscape to show up in the task list and get multiple
top-level windows at the same time Netscape needs to keep one of its
windows iconized at all times.  The icon will always be named "Netscape"
and will not de-iconize if you click on it.  Yup, its still there in 1.1.
<p>
<dt><b>How do I use Netscape without a network connection?</b>
<dd>If you do not have a network connection but still want to user
Netscape to browse local files you should get the file
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429140139/ftp://ftp.netscape.com/pub/unsupported/windows/mozock.dll">mozock.dll</a>.
If you install this file as winsock.dll Netscape will work fine with
local file reads.  Be sure to shift-click on the above link or else
Netscape will treat it as a text document.  Doh!
If you want to get out to the rest of the net
mozock.dll is not for you.
